  "so hey everyone um I think we have uh people joined here and uh this uh first instructor uh live session is basically trying to understand a sense of what uh currently is happening any specific queries that you would like to get answered anything that is pressing which you have already raed in this course and we wanted much more clarity uh you can bring up those uh specific it's more like a query and uh question session and moreover also to have uh some level of uh uh expectations for the",
  "have uh some level of uh uh expectations for the future live sessions especially this uh the session which is on Wednesday yeah you can uh please go ahead with if uh with any specific questions that you would like to get addressed here hi if I can start uh I see uh WESH has asked for where can I find the uploaded documents I think these are added as a part of YouTube playlist you should be able to see them in the YouTube okay so am I [Music] audible okay I see deep shika racing uh plan uh",
  "audible okay I see deep shika racing uh plan uh please go ahead question so how to how to approach TDS I don't able to understand so can you repeat that again I missed the first part sir how to approach [Music] TDS uh did you ask about how to do study TDS or I mean that's more like a generic question but still was that the question which you have raised how to study TDS yes sir okay so TDS as it explains it's tools used in data science and uh uh almost you have uh the the course itself is",
  "uh uh almost you have uh the the course itself is designed to handle uh different aspects of day-to-day actions or day-to-day problems that you solve with respect to data and uh other uh data related uh applications so the course first uh introduces you to Everyday tools uh basically I mean development tools uh the tools that are used for development right from right from vs code to uh npm to all the specific Ways by which you can do developmental activity and it gives a Hands-On um um detail",
  "activity and it gives a Hands-On um um detail of how you can utilize both the tool as well as try to solve a problem that you generally face anywhere within uh the Professional Network or somewhere to do resolve a problem in the research which you do uh then we move on to the next module which is deployment tools those are uh those will provide uh an Insight on how you can use or deploy a solution that you have developed I think these are the two modules that uh they have covered so far the",
  "two modules that uh they have covered so far the best way to do TDs is to practice or do a real life example and whatever we do as GA sessions GA sessions are all practical uh uh way to handle the specific uh uh problem statement be it uh taking a Unix log code and then finding outx patter or uh any specific uh detail uh all the ga questions have been uh set in such a way that those are something which you do by an activity and then ensure that that activity helps you uh in uh solving a problem",
  "activity helps you uh in uh solving a problem not much of a uh we wanted you to make sure that whatever we learned in theory across different courses or even as a part of TDS always ties back to the way exercise ties back to implementing them in Gs exercise them ensure that you know the right way learning theory is one section but implementing that with tools I mean that's the main motive of having the tools and data science course and the way to uh uh I mean coming back to the question how how",
  "uh uh I mean coming back to the question how how to study TDS the best thing is to uh take out all the examples and then if you run down each example one by one you will be well versed with the specific problem the moment you start working with Excel uh and if you familiarize the tool the problem solving a problem with the tool becomes easier I think uh uh Calton can even explain much more detail on how it helped out or how uh the course can add up but uh from my point of view you should start",
  "up but uh from my point of view you should start using the tools for the right method and also the automations which you learn here those are some things which will basically uh increase your productivity in a day-to-day pattern that you can visibly see it if we start implementing them gon anything you would like to add on top of that um yeah just along the lines of what um um s said um practice is required the sessions uh many students find very useful so either attending the session so that",
  "useful so either attending the session so that you can ask your questions immediately and get immediate feedback or watching them later uh often times students who have uh been to the sessions or watched the sessions I found quite a lot of use from the sessions so sessions will be a good place where you can uh really get to grips with some of the course material if you're stuck somewhere but uh practi is is a key part of it you'll have to uh really use the tools uh try out the things that are",
  "use the tools uh try out the things that are shown in the videos it's a very practical very Hands-On type of course um in fact that's the reason if you look at the ga um in the graded document we have increased um the value of the GS to 15% of the course grade because there is a lot of uh effort involved in actually solving the gas and uh one of the primary mechanisms of delivering course content will actually be through the GS themselves but there is also for those that have asked this",
  "but there is also for those that have asked this question and have seen it even in this course Sometimes some students have not realized that if you go to the course introduction page on the um uh portal uh that's where the link to the entire course content is so the content is not just in the ga modules on Portal it is actually if you go to course introduction on that very first page uh there is a link that link takes you to the actual course content for the whole term there are some bits that",
  "for the whole term there are some bits that are still in work in progress that's the later weeks we will add them as uh as the weeks go by uh but yeah that's um pretty much what prasana said sir said I would like to mirror the same Echo the same sentiment that he has mentioned so far thanks uh Manas B would you like to go ahead yes sir uh am I audible sir yeah yeah you are audible yes sir uh a lot of students like me are absolutely new to this field and have no EXP experience in using a lot of",
  "and have no EXP experience in using a lot of tools like even basic Python and starting from visual source code was like basic question it took me half an hour to understand what is being asked of me so it seems the course was designed with the idea that students already had exposure to a lot of different things before coming here but a lot of students also did not sir like uh basic things also we have to struggle you have to find different things sir what do we do in this situations yes sir",
  "sir what do we do in this situations yes sir understood so I think uh the ga uh zero the first GA which we had I think that was more like a self assessment where it was clearly mentioned that if you are able to score something which is at a higher s greater than 50% it essentially means uh how the course is structured so if you taken GA Zer uh you'll be able to understand how this course is completely structured and we also intimated everyone that as a part of the ga test itself we clearly",
  "that as a part of the ga test itself we clearly mentioned that if it's being tough it's right time that you choose uh this at a later stage when you have uh better Clarity with python modules or better Clarity with respective courses or electives that are related to TDs I think ga0 was an evaluation uh module for our a self assessment module for the entire students who are uh uh attempting for TDS I think this is the same question which we get each and every term and we have been very uh",
  "get each and every term and we have been very uh precisely mentioning that your first test should be able to uh help you in a self assessment because every course that is taken you have a timeline until the second week to drop from the course so the idea was to give an an essense of how uh or the skill set that is required to take up the TDS and uh uh first thing is uh if you have scored a phenomenal Mark in g0 and still see a struggle I think that is something which uh we can map up map up",
  "that is something which uh we can map up map up with a learning curve if you're able to score uh considerable Mark in g z it means that you have a sense of how things have to be done and still you can have a swift learning curve and you'll be able to catch up with all these Technologies but you have got a very low G score it clearly mentions that you need to have few electrics to be covered before jumping on to uh or before uh opting out to TDs I think that's the statement which you would like",
  "I think that's the statement which you would like to say apart from this let's say still if you think TDs is something which have taken up uh learning curve as I see here uh uh for each and everything you will definitely need a start and when come when it comes to let's say uh uh basic uh scripting unless until we do the basic scripting it will still be a concept that is still not learned so on a on a on on a larger scale of course uh having practiced makes you uh or gives a better Advantage",
  "makes you uh or gives a better Advantage for uh students who already have practiced these uh skill set especially development or deployment and then enrolling two years they have a upper Advantage but uh someone who is starting up fresh uh this content might be new but uh the content which you have Frozen up for this uh term or within the week is something which you can grasp and learn on a faster rate depending upon the effort that has been put I think uh on a on a larger note the statement",
  "I think uh on a on a larger note the statement here is ga0 was a self assessment so you will know where you fall into and then it'll be easy for the students to choose the right option uh for them and uh uh Point number two once you have chosen TDS I feel that uh the content has been set in such a way that everything is a pointto point example like Calton mentioned that uh the G are uh driving the entire course content like you have a ga question and you have a specific content that explains",
  "and you have a specific content that explains how the G question can be solved so uh as long as you are able to get uh GS course it means that you have actually learned how to use it to and uh that's how I see and this course doesn't think about like uh checking out all pandas like extensively jump into pandas and see all the functions within pandas it's basically when you have a requirement you work on that requirement and understand that requirement uh this is how even in professional work",
  "uh this is how even in professional work where or wherever you uh end up in a job essentially uh it's the same way how you handle a specific request we may not be an expert in a specific library or specific tool all we need is make sure that the tool is helping out to uh get the result that is required and ensure that it is automated and scalable and deployed so that uh you don't repeat the same task again and again so that's the same way how this tools and data s also set up we have set things",
  "tools and data s also set up we have set things from right from solving a simple problem and making it scalable so that's uh uh the overall uh points here sir then sorry for interrupting sir I would still like to request that the weeks that you're still working on I would like to put in some request for making few personalized videos like not from YouTube of videos that you uh teachers make so like uh it introduces this course matter better A lot of the YouTube videos just uh started talking",
  "lot of the YouTube videos just uh started talking about these things but I did not get a clear concept of understanding all of the different YouTube videos moreover confused me in the later Parts I don't understand that yeah I totally understand that you will have PA sessions which are dedicated for this uh learning curve uh Calton can uh explain in detail about the TA sessions as well as uh specific course content related uh sessions that are scheduled almost every day or alternate days",
  "are scheduled almost every day or alternate days explaining about each content right from scratch opening it up from a file to loading uh the content uh doing it handson so maybe Calton you can jump on and explain like how the TA sessions run and when the TA start for the current term yeah so um so the sessions that we planned for this term uh this is where like you will gain a lot the sessions themselves will be very valuable for students that are um struggling to get a grasp of the tools and",
  "are um struggling to get a grasp of the tools and um so that's so for example tomorrow there is a session if you look in your calendar I think it runs from 8 to 10: that'll be the first uh real proper session where we will uh basically walk you through some of the uh tools that we are using using for the first couple of weeks and uh we really take the time to articulate the various aspects that you need to focus on in terms of learning so we will I don't want to call it handholding but we will",
  "I don't want to call it handholding but we will uh explain to you what the important things are to consider when you're using the tool and then after that uh you should be able to take it up from there so that's generally how the sessions go um with regards to everything else that p s said I mean he he I couldn't have said it better um he you know he articulated exactly the point of TDS which is it's how real life uh things work and um we took a very um uh considered effort to make sure that it",
  "very um uh considered effort to make sure that it mirrors what you will expect in the real world see a lot of the courses that you take in this BS degree uh are very theoretical okay but uh when you go to into a job place um that theory will only take you so far and uh you will encounter problems just like how you will see in these how these G are structured in fact as you look at some of the later G they will give you a kind of scenario and gives you a basis for why we are asking you this kind",
  "you a basis for why we are asking you this kind of question so you get a sense of um the workflow of of the kinds of things you would be expected to do in a workplace and um in the beginning uh most students will find this very daunting because when they look at the content it's like very new and very hard uh uh in if you look on the site okay so what I'll do is I'll share my screen really quick so I can um show what I'm looking at here uh so is my screen visible yes sir okay yes sir it's",
  "so is my screen visible yes sir okay yes sir it's visible so um I don't know if you have realized this but uh unlike most courses uh reading will be very important in this course okay uh most people skip past this course introduction but actually all the course content is available through this link okay um and when you go to this link it will take you to this site and virtually all the content for the seven weeks we put it straight up front so you know at a glance this is what you'll be",
  "so you know at a glance this is what you'll be expected to have this will be your deliverable at the end of of 12 weeks these seven modules is what we want you to get to grips with okay um and then if you look at the very first bit you know it will uh you know read everything in here because all of this is useful for you to know so if you click on these for example it gives you the basis of why why we are doing what we are doing so it gives you a sense of grounds grounds you in the expectation",
  "a sense of grounds grounds you in the expectation of TDS okay so I really recommend you you take the time read through this and as person was saying I mean you mentioned GA Z it's actually ga1 um so ga1 is the uh graded assignment that checks if you're ready for this course okay and um it explains to you the rational behind so I know some of you said um we don't uh you know we don't have exposure etc etc and I think this is a fantastic explanation for why we have taken this approach okay",
  "for why we have taken this approach okay because in the real world this is what is going to happen so for example you might have taken only the diploma and data science and that is something the program provides yes uh and TDs is part of the data science part of it but this this paragraph I think encapsulates the reasoning very well why TDs is uh is the way it's been structured the way it is and most students okay uh in the beginning they find it very challenging but at the end of it uh if you",
  "very challenging but at the end of it uh if you ask anyone who has graduated out of the TDS uh module uh they will tell you this is the one subject in the in the diploma that has really helped them to become job ready uh and that's the sentiment accorded by students that have taken this this particular subject um so you know we we we really believe we are delivering something very valuable uh for your learning and it will really really help you in your professional career um and then um you",
  "in your professional career um and then um you know we encourage learning by sharing you know this is something unique uh in that sense to TDs there isn't something like oh you know copying and is bad or something but uh one thing I will say about so I'll I'll put it with a slight caveat okay we don't care if you if you copy your answers from somewhere else or anything like that but uh from a when I think about it from a pedagogy point of view okay or to use a simple word and I think about it",
  "okay or to use a simple word and I think about it from a learning point of view sure you can copy things and you will get a grade and you will move move on from here but you're robbing yourself of the learning so if you rob yourself of the learning then you will pay the price somewhere else for it so for example at an interview you'll pay the price or at a job you will pay the price so instead why not do it here when you are able to practice and you're in an environment where you can be",
  "and you're in an environment where you can be supported and we've got a fantastic team uh in tus and they're willing to support you willing to help you learn make use of that struggle with it when you struggle with something that's when you learn the best and uh again students who have gone through that process who have gone through that uh trial by fire as it were okay trial by tedious fire they really come out of it uh um um stronger for it they they they begin to appreciate what they have",
  "they they they begin to appreciate what they have achieved through it you know it's something that you have achieved something you can internalize and take with you further so that's uh that's the value in uh struggling through it and again like I said it's reflected in the increased value of the graded assignments we have decreased the value of the final entom because the final entom uh doesn't um if it's very hard to test a practical course like TDS with with a theory based question questions",
  "TDS with with a theory based question questions right so we have reduced the weight of that and as you can see most of the weight is going to come in the very practical part of the course um and so that's uh what this is and if you look through uh the graded assignments so on here you know you'll see the graded assignments again this this really uh encapsulates What uh we're trying to deliver you know the the questions themselves are the primary Del Del primary mechanism to which the content is",
  "Del Del primary mechanism to which the content is delivered but if you want to learn it better then you can of course go through go through these things one by one and much of it is explained in the same way in the in the G as well but um maybe on the site it's a little more better structured for you to understand what what the expectations are and the g themselves then deliver your learning as it were okay uh is that does that help at least um in some way for you to get a a sense of what is",
  "in some way for you to get a a sense of what is expected uh one thing if Carlton uh this is Anand here if I can speak in between yeah yeah go ahead yeah yeah so what I was telling is for example last time also I took along with MLP but then I dropped after having consultation with you so I started preparing started to go through CSS and JavaScript thing so a little bit I got to know like the basic things but I when I checked here about the Cod content there are few of the uh compiler things the",
  "there are few of the uh compiler things the one U UV which uh which helps in uh to eliminate the PIP completely and helps pack packaging the software which was which is there so yeah U but I exactly don't know how we are using it and where we should be using it so so so knitting them together and then applying them to do something that's something we are like like I'm not aware of so one programmers who are there one programmers who are there because me professionally I'm from like analytics",
  "because me professionally I'm from like analytics background where I do completely everything on tools like I dayto day I don't uh like uh work on these things all right so yeah so these things uh we will actually in the sessions cover these so if you're having trouble getting to grips with UV uh I mean even for us this was quite new but what's the what we found but I mean speaking specifically about UV the beauty of this is it eliminates the needs for having a virtual environment and",
  "the needs for having a virtual environment and eliminates the need for PP installing um dependencies eliminates uh um a lot of the um sort of uh things that generally you have to put together in order to run a script so it's uh actually saves you a lot of time uh saves you a lot of hake when you're uh um deploying something uh deploying a package so UV is a really fantastic tool actually uh but we will uh even if you're finding it a bit difficult at the beginning uh we will in fact tomorrow be",
  "at the beginning uh we will in fact tomorrow be covering um the basics of how to do use this and once you get to understand how it's used right you will never go back to the previous way of doing things and because it will just make you so much faster and more productive than than ever before so uh one one more thing is there for example ter bash terminal is there so uh previously while like in some part of my career Journey we used to use Postman for sending up HTML requests so now like the",
  "for sending up HTML requests so now like the tool is something which is changing every time and now I'm not able to relate one thing to the other how each of them are related to each other so it uh what do you call a quick refresher will be good for us if that works like how each one of these things are related to each other like because reading them as a separate part won't like doesn't give a clear picture yeah we can address some of these things uh in the in the upcoming sessions so uh I",
  "things uh in the in the upcoming sessions so uh I mean today is just uh an overview of what the course expectations are and general doubts today but uh as uh I think the proper proper course content delivery will probably start from tomorrow I would say so we will touch upon these things you know uh you so you're talking about uh bash and um some of the scripts what's what's the use of them and how how do they work come into your workflow so a good example that I can think of okay is um I was",
  "good example that I can think of okay is um I was quite so when I was trying to open up I think just last term or the term before uh I was trying to open up a large file on uh on one of the tools and it was uh taking a lot of resources it was slow and um all these sort of issues but uh some some of these things right which normally would open up in pandas or in in a notebook or something uh you might think okay this is this is the easiest way to do it but they may not work so well for humongous",
  "do it but they may not work so well for humongous data sets and uh that's where it uh things that you do in bash they may be simple things okay uh they suddenly come really come shining to the four when when it comes to dealing with um millions of lines or millions of lines of data and they do it so extraordinarily fast um and with such simple commands um you're just your mind just gets blown away and you think uh you know someone who's uh so for example you're talking about data analytics",
  "for example you're talking about data analytics right so imagine you have a colleague who comes in he knows the bash and can do the same thing you you know you used to do in in a in a notebook and uh he comes along and is able to just write uh you know effectively three four lines of uh maybe not even that maybe two lines of code and achieves the same thing that you're able to do in a you know in a big notebook that doesn't handle large files well right so that that's a useful skill uh you know",
  "right so that that's a useful skill uh you know to have in the workplace so we will show you some of those uh tricks and tips and things like that and show you how you can use it in a workflow so that's something we will touch upon in future sessions right so when we going through the tools one by one we will definitely help you and um introduce you to some of those things that you can use and they won't be very difficult okay they're not so challenging it's just a matter of knowing versus not",
  "it's just a matter of knowing versus not knowing if you didn't know it you can't use it so tools for tdus tools for data science is basically getting you in touch with current uh industry what practices are because that's what Anand is very much in in touch with right so he looks at what's in the ecosystem and then he he makes that available to us that's why tools are for data science very Cutting Edge usually and changes from term to term and that's the reason for the dramatic I mean if you as",
  "the reason for the dramatic I mean if you as you've seen last term the course would content would have looked different and now suddenly it's again different it's because we try to keep it very current very Cutting Edge so when you get out there you're you know you're you're well equipped to deal with new things that you'll face out there I ask something yeah yeah please go ahead actually I'm not from the Science Background or any background from where I know programming or much about Computer",
  "where I know programming or much about Computer Applications so knowing so going through these stuff makes it quite difficult for me I can't just understand what I have to do and submitting the graded assignments from this part becomes very tedious as a part from tools for data science so what I can do from my end just uh just to add in the question if I have the permission to do so hello sir yeah carry on what's the question uh so um just to add on to the question I had taken a TDS two terms",
  "on to the question I had taken a TDS two terms back and now when I'm left only with TDS in the diploma in data science course I still haven't gone uh got any extra skill that wasn't present two terms back so how should I go about this and I plan on just completing data science and leaving the course and before I have only done Python and in the remaining two terms that I had time I went through HTML so kindly guide on how to go about the course yeah so there's been a lot of change from two",
  "yeah so there's been a lot of change from two terms ago um um lot of the things now we looking at will involve for example um the idea of deployability when you created an application um you know some data science application some kind of deliverable that you're trying to get across to your clients um how to do that deployment right so that it's uh quickly re quickly available to your clients they can interact with your models and produce something that um enables them to make decisions based",
  "that um enables them to make decisions based on what You' have uh designed so that deployability and using the tools that help get your data from uh where it's sitting to your clients that's part of the workflow and um the next part of it is how we deal with um some extraordinary tools uh for example GPT to do some things that traditionally was uh either used to be very cumbersome to do using programming uh whereas now you can achieve those same uh uh nearly uh you know or maybe even better",
  "uh uh nearly uh you know or maybe even better results using uh the power of a GPT and how to integrate that GPT into your workflow so making your programs intelligent adaptable uh self correcting uh all these sorts of uh aspects of it uh we will will be showing in the course one thing that uh I'm getting the sense of in this session which is good always in the first session to get a sense of is um there are varying skill levels okay in in this uh uh course so some will have very um um low code",
  "uh course so some will have very um um low code skills and some will have reasonably uh okay skills and some will have very uh strong coding skills so uh I think maybe the we we have to think I mean we haven't yet thought of this uh way to do it but uh maybe there might be an opt opportunity to for example schedule certain sessions to deal uh with very basic sorts of things and then we can have others sessions that deal with more intermediate level or advanced level uh uh understanding of the",
  "or advanced level uh uh understanding of the tools so maybe that's something we can sit and discuss as a team and see how we can approach exactly sir you're you're thinking right and this was the same case two terms back as well now when you have different level of skill sets for us who are very new to programming comprehending so many l so many tools in the first week and giving the graded assignment and the help will be provided only after the graded assignment is submitted is something very",
  "graded assignment is submitted is something very daunting for us like yeah okay um is 26 and the last term also the the two times back also it happened the discussion on the question of the ga started only after 26 and no help was provided before that so are we expecting the same scenario again so we will solve the G only after the G is ended but um maybe what we can do is we can at least introduce you to how to use the tools before that so that way at least you'll get an opportunity to you you",
  "way at least you'll get an opportunity to you you know learn how to use the tools in order to solve the GS uh you know something we can definitely try and Achieve uh for this term yes definitely sir that would be very helpful for us because only this course is something that is stopping us from completing diploma and taking and going back with the going back home because other courses are done only TDS personally I is left and I don't have an option to drop this I had the option two terms back",
  "to drop this I had the option two terms back so I dropped it but now when I just need to complete this and complete my MBA yeah I think yeah I think part of the issue was um it's uh this course was never meant to be sort of uh an intro to Programming type of course okay so that's why there was not a lot of U um significant support uh to learn very basic things so there was always this um approach to this course but um I'll have a word with the professor and um you know speak with the rest of",
  "professor and um you know speak with the rest of the team and see what we you know what can be done I'll speak with the operations as well and get a sense for what we should do going forward because clearly there's a a wide skill Gap and skill difference in levels and how we can best cater to everyone is something we we have to think about because normally these skills that you're talking about right most students will get that from doing the programming diploma part of the BS degree so those",
  "diploma part of the BS degree so those who go through that process they will be able to handle most of this fairly easily um it's the it's the ones that for example like yourself who are only doing the data science part of the diploma that will uh will find it a challenge so I understand the challenge but um we'll we'll need to sit together with um with the rest of the team and get some because we cannot unilaterally kind of decide how to do that right so we'll get a sense from them how do we",
  "right so we'll get a sense from them how do we go about it and how perhaps we can best help you in the in the journey okay um we will try our best that I will promise you um yes sir U this was the same issue six months back and for our term when we just have to complete the course and leave I think it's better to have an optimistic solution of having support sessions rather than going and discuss discussing it with the operations and other teams because that will take a lot of time and we",
  "teams because that will take a lot of time and we cannot wait till then so if you can commit to having support sessions for each tool for us uh for the new ones that would be really great okay we will let me let me get back on to you on that okay but we will take you and take what you have said into consideration we'll try and try and see if we can schedule separate sessions for uh for those who are struggling with the uh programming part of it or getting to um don't have the required skill",
  "it or getting to um don't have the required skill levels in order to do this uh this particular subject okay but I cannot make a direct call on that right now in this session okay I can't make that commitment straight away but um we'll discuss this internally first and see what we can do okay sure thank you so much sir okay hello sir yeah go ahead yes sir good evening so actually I'm telling that uh not only me there are many friends of mine and including me also uh Suppose there are many",
  "and including me also uh Suppose there are many questions in graded assignment one uh in the Linux system okay so in my system or in many uh students also the Linux system is not supporting okay so it would be better to first introduce the installment of the system so that we can deploy all the codes so it would be very much better for us and in grd assignment two also I've seen that some some of the questions are from Lama file so that is totally from The Mach learning section so I recommend",
  "from The Mach learning section so I recommend ke uh first to uh install the system for the requirements so that we can easily deploy our requirements so will there be any session regarding this deployment of the system or anything that like that um I'll make a note of it and um we'll I'll discuss it with the Tas and we'll see if we can schedule some sessions to inst yes yes because installing the system at first is to much difficult for many students including me also so it would be very much",
  "including me also so it would be very much better so that we can deploy our questions smoothly if we can install the system okay uh I I made a note of that so I'll thank you we'll make an announcement uh about the sessions themselves and what they will cover so that will give you an idea of which sessions are worth attending or and also they will be uploaded as well so we'll put a description um that's something else we will try and do this term which is new we will try and bookmark the um",
  "term which is new we will try and bookmark the um sessions to have have uh chapters in them so say for example you're looking for how to install WSL on a system okay just examp then question right so there will be a video with the chapter that will say okay this is the section which deals with that then there will be another section which you can just jump so if you some of some of you are probably already familiar with WSL then you can just skip that part go to the next part that say for",
  "skip that part go to the next part that say for example deals with okay how do you um install node U uh node package manager or you can skip that part if you know how to do that so we will try and do that this time that's one new thing we're going to try and do okay okay so s one more question also that uh I have seen the previous year questions for the entm so in endm basis in entm there are mainly the theory based question okay so in Gs we are actually facing the Practical based questions so",
  "actually facing the Practical based questions so regarding to the theories question from where we can learn the theories question so that we can answering the exam for okay so one thing I will say about dentum it's likely to be completely different this time around okay um we are overhauling the way end terms are done so I can't really tell you at this point that okay you you read uh study the end terms and it will be similar I I really cannot promise you that what I can say is there there's",
  "promise you that what I can say is there there's going to be some major changes to the way end term is being okay so sir according to that chance if you provide us the resources that we should study or prepare for like that only so it would be better for us we will try and provide you maybe a mock before the end term but from that yeah but apart from that uh just be familiar with the tools and how they work that's that's going to be best bet okay sir thank you hello sir just to add one point",
  "sir thank you hello sir just to add one point with C mention so with respect to unique's uh bash command it necessarily doesn't mean that you have to install the the entire system there could be other ways to also have or resolve the issue where Google collab uh the CPU runtime which is hosted that basically is a unique system and there are different ways by which the available free sources you may not need to essentially remodel the entire uh system which you have or entire uh or the infra the",
  "which you have or entire uh or the infra the infrastructure which you being a personal laptop or some sort of PC which you have uh I don't think it requires a complete remodel it's all about how we can effectively use the free online resources as well as make effective use of how the uh bash commands can be tested both in collab as well as with other open sources I think uh we'll take that as a part and then in one of the da sessions we'll include that how we can test these bash commands using",
  "that how we can test these bash commands using uh a specific collab setup and in uh I mean uh uh if setting up WSL within a Windows system are using Mac which has home brew those are something which can go as an add-on details but what I tried to mention is it necessarily doesn't mean that you have to install altogether a new system to study this course this course can be learned and uh be uh experimented using the existing open source tools so may I proceed I'm next in line yeah yeah please go",
  "I proceed I'm next in line yeah yeah please go ahead yeah uh good evening uh dear instructors uh I would firstly like to express my appreciation for for the learning by doing approach of this course uh it's quite real world Focus but just for clarity I have a two- tier question and I'll apologize if it is too much related to uh the questions already asked it is SL administrative in nature uh the first doubt or query which I have is that uh given that this course was mentioned as having no",
  "given that this course was mentioned as having no prerequisites uh but it uh says that you need to have a certain level of programming skills I was only wondering that uh since in diploma level we have completed our foundation level so the uh computational thinking and intro to Python Programming courses are any other programming skills uh you know mandatory for this course or uh apart from these two prerequisites everything as you mentioned uh can be picked up uh smoothly or not so smoothly in",
  "be picked up uh smoothly or not so smoothly in that learning curve and uh apart from that uh just to make sure like you know this course is at least possible in theory at least so for the non-extensive programming background students for all the gas projects and the Roe and the end term will the content introduced throughout the course or through the TA sessions uh be uh sufficient or you know it would be something like uh which is the spirit of this course you know Tinker by yourself learn by",
  "this course you know Tinker by yourself learn by yourself so I just want to make sure you know what approach is to be followed so those are my two questions thank you PR you want to answer that yeah uh going back on the prerequisites I think uh we had list of discussions with Ops Team especially on prerequisits but and uh while taking the course like what uh we just showed the ga1 was uh the perfect self assessment test so to answer the question if uh the ga1 basically uh you were able to score",
  "if uh the ga1 basically uh you were able to score that in a with a phenomenal score like something which is significant then obviously you should be able to grasp and the learning curve could be easier whereas if the ga scores are ga1 score is low it means that an additional effort has to be put because some of the basic things which we uh consider as a part of uh uh um the day-to-day activities in TVs I think that's something which you may have to start learning up so the learning Cod will be",
  "to start learning up so the learning Cod will be little uh uh more effort has to be put up from the students perspective I think ga1 will be a right assessment to go ahead uh taking up this course as well as trying to understand the effort that is required to uh gain the skill set uh was I able to answer that clearly yes sir uh somehow yeah coming back I think this we are still working on because tools and data science generally covers multiple sets and uh um we may not precisely Define that it",
  "and uh um we may not precisely Define that it requires a uh coding background or it's more like how proficient you are with specific tools it doesn't cover one single tool so if you can see the uh list here the deployment tools and development tools uh we couldn't confine with a specific scenario where you have to expert with specific tools or specific scripting so that you are able to uh take up this course if you if uh this is something still we are uh working out but on a larger note to be",
  "we are uh working out but on a larger note to be clear for a student in terms of understanding whether this course has any prequest we have expressly mentioned that as a ga1 score if uh that will give a clear metric of how uh we can handle how this course content would be and what the skill set we are expecting from the students over there so but to complete the ga1 does the learning resources that we have in dashboard is it enough or do we need to also practice it from outside to uh so to",
  "need to also practice it from outside to uh so to again to get that so for completing ga1 if you're able to work through the specific content that is Shar uh that should be self-explanatory you should be able to solve out the problems using the uh content material it doesn't require any additional set of knowledge that is required to solve the problems with G so like I tried to solve the the problems I'm getting stuck in like few of the scripting like in question two so are we going to like",
  "like in question two so are we going to like discuss few of the things on it like not the answers but like the discussion on the top yes we will uh in the sessions we will discuss how to use the tools and um how to uh you know use them effectively so that you can solve the problems okay sir can I take my turn please yes please uh sir I am basar and thanks for this opportunity to speak with you sir and my my expression is completely in a different dimension to the expression that I given by the",
  "dimension to the expression that I given by the earlier people I started with a great enthusiasm to this course and I have also attended an's first introduction to the course as well as as instructor kind of thing it's so amazing and amusing also so as usual so I'm I'm interviewed with this character and all like that sir that is point number one point number two some time back our stats means uh the other lecture who handled stats he conceptualized about the open book system kind of things sir",
  "about the open book system kind of things sir uh means some exams will be there in in this course where in open book system would be applied to that one and when I have seen this course curriculum on my own um in the before last term kind of thing when the videos are there uploaded in the the uh in the YouTube kind of thing I I felt with like ah kind of thing sir so why because that one is by that time I'm doing my MLP program and uh we are struggling with doing a single model with some data",
  "with doing a single model with some data set but in your course actually uh that data set has been um I mean modeled automatically in the uh in the set resources like python with this collab itself with a couple of commands uh all the all the possible models all the possible models that have been taught to us or 50% of the models which have been taught to us are automatically given the output kind of thing uh the comparision statement has been given I mean I got to be mindboggling I thought why",
  "I mean I got to be mindboggling I thought why I am studying this uh ml ml uh for three terms actually that is MLT MLF and MLP all these on went to wave kind of thing in my mind uh with this with that particular video itself uh that is my first experience with this course curriculum sir and uh and uh even to help some of my friends in the earlier term with the tedious kind of thing in the project itself I have gone through uh run through I can say I can say run through all the videos or relevant",
  "I can say run through all the videos or relevant videos that are required kind of thing uh that is that is truly actually a wow kind of thing from my side to understand for the presentation point of view the the ultimate u u purpose of this particular particular course is nothing but presentation that is there in the last uh two weeks kind of things sir uh that that presentation will be too good according to the imagination that one would be having in their minds kind of thing let us say in the",
  "in their minds kind of thing let us say in the case of MLP what uh I'm talking about earlier uh there'll be small databases will be there and the large databases will be also there so there are some other models we need to try and test with large model models also for that one as you tell I have not read but the bash command if it can run like that and within seconds if you are able to get the result with the with with with effortless kind of thing that's truly a great thing sir apart from that",
  "that's truly a great thing sir apart from that um in the zero kind of thing um what I have I'm shared with kind of thing that one Mark challenge intrigued me and uh uh I I said wow kind of thing for the course again why because it is asking me to be a prompt engineer immediately now itself means whatever knowledge I'm having right now with me that is forcing me to be a prompt engineer immediately uh which is a very good skill uh that can that can feed me uh even in the US market or Indian",
  "can feed me uh even in the US market or Indian market kind of thing right now and apart from that maybe I request you I request you as a course kind of thing I request you not to compromise on the content that you wanted to deliver for this s for the for this ter at least I me to say some some couple of hours back I've gone through the MIT uh for deep learning kind of thing uh that man who is running the course uh from the past four years is telling that uh the last year 8 months back the video",
  "that uh the last year 8 months back the video is there sir uh the AI is evolving like anything so it is a fast ped obviously so um up to what extent we are able to catch up it isy skill or there what we need to learn in this steep curve of learning I me to say even though if you are able to get something like 10% or 20% or 30% or pass let say 40% is enough to be in the market as a rising star I can say that is my uh feeling right now sir and as usual the other students ask for a supportive uh",
  "usual the other students ask for a supportive uh information to be given to us beforehand or along with this one uh that is the right point I do agree to that one um we can use that Google uh space kind of thing to update the extra information whatever it might be maybe uh medium project people are also doing the same kind of things that could be one of the resource wherein we can always refer uh whenever we are free kind of thing and whenever we are stucking with the I me to say I know that",
  "we are stucking with the I me to say I know that this is nothing but a open book uh uh system of uh evaluation that's why uh even the end term is only 20% marks have been given to this one and should the total concept or the pedagogy what the instructors also tried to mention that one that could be a new thing for us or for the whole system of uh 10 15 years of learning what the other people might be gone through uh so that might be that might be daunting other than that one this course I feel",
  "daunting other than that one this course I feel like this amusing and entertaining as usual uh as an sir I believe [Music] sir thanks for the feedback uh I think I have got the grasp of why we want to have the session and uh this so whatever uh wui has mention is exactly what we have put up the reason why we have to have tools in data science why you should learn and why ises a the right time you should learn uh so I think that uh makes it all yeah thanks uh uh I have a hot stop at uh 10 so uh",
  "thanks uh uh I have a hot stop at uh 10 so uh maybe we can run down through one more question and uh I can set up my email ID here you can use discour as well as any forums for additional questions um anything apart from then I have a very hard stop this time maybe for next sessions I'll plan little extending the session to one and a half hours so that we can cover up all the queries uh maybe we'll take one or two questions from here so shall I do can I just ask a question sir sir I just wanted",
  "can I just ask a question sir sir I just wanted to ask the question about Ro examinations sir can we get any uh question paper or pyq type of thing for that we are working on the previous question papers those will give you a sense of how the Roe looks that doesn't essentially mean that's the Roe so Ro is basically a fire kind of examination where you have you can collaborate you can uh work with the groups uh but essentially the data set you have to work upon uh a different data set for every",
  "to work upon uh a different data set for every term and the range of questions will be based on the data set that is being selected I think for Roe sessions we'll have we'll be keeping on uh we'll keep on a discussion group and we'll explain you how Roe works out and also we are uh working on releasing the previous set of uh uh questions both Ro and and few other sets which we are thinking that it will help uh everyone to understand what were the previous Roes we are working on that we'll keep",
  "previous Roes we are working on that we'll keep you updated on this course okay sir thank you sir and Sir one more doubt small doubt only sir uh while doing the ga1 I solved every question only one question left but and also I saved it but now when I open it it shows Zer is score so is this a glitch of the website or something else yesterday till yesterday it was showing 9.5 marks and from today it's showing zero marks so I have to do every question again sir uh one can you look at it once uh",
  "again sir uh one can you look at it once uh Calton we did discuss about this little earlier right so uh right now you should be able to have saved sessions if not can you raise it up as a discourse uh uh query we'll keep you updated on that sure yeah so yeah we we had um discussed this technical issue so your answers are saved okay that's one thing I can guarantee you uh whatever you submitted have been saved the only uh caveat I would put to that is let's say for example you answered 15 out of",
  "is let's say for example you answered 15 out of the 16 questions okay and today you decided to answer the 16th question my advice is refill all the answers of the first 15 questions and also then put in your 16 questions and then say save because otherwise you may uh have run the risk of not having any answers for the first 50 and only having an answer for the 16% but having said that we are working on the back end to try and make sure that um it's it's a work in progress where we are trying to",
  "it's a work in progress where we are trying to get the answers fetched from the back end and populated onto your um um your actual site okay on your browser okay sir thank you so much sir sir I don't want take much time want to know one thing uh so we've got grader assignment for submission and then end term exam quiz one and Quiz 2 what is this Roe and the other things we have for grading since it's new to us I've just taken up this course after my foundation and it's also new so I just want",
  "my foundation and it's also new so I just want to know what are things have to focus for grading yeah the projects are take-home project which means that you will have a specific uh requirement to complete a project and it will be open in the uh portal from you can see the dates here from 17 Jan to 15 Feb you can see that it will be open which means take home project you will have a data set and you will have a set of questions on top of it and you'll have scenarios and scenario based questions",
  "have scenarios and scenario based questions so uh it's a take home project which means it it'll be handed over to you and you you can work around uh uh the optimized Solutions and then uh write back the answers in the same portal so that's how the projects work project one and project two are take home open internet it doesn't and when it comes to Roe Roe is remote online exam it's an online open internet McQ which means that uh we have like a 45 minute or 1 hour session it depends upon the",
  "a 45 minute or 1 hour session it depends upon the data set which we are uh filtering out for the remote online and here uh to ensure collaboration so we are trying to recreate the same scenario what you would experience in a specific uh professional uh career uh it's not that everyone has to work in solving a problem it's all about collaboration and ensuring that you are able to achieve your deadlines so here we open up a discourse Channel we open up gmet link and we make sure that uh everyone",
  "up gmet link and we make sure that uh everyone can collaborate and then work around and it will be a set of uh it depends upon the data set so so to be clear it it will be a a short exam which is 45 minutes and within 45 minutes you'll be given uh uh set of questions that needs to be solved where you can collaborate across different platforms right from discourse to WhatsApp to all set of platforms okay so so the discourse link and all will be sent later on is it yeah exactly so remote online",
  "sent later on is it yeah exactly so remote online is scheduled on 2nd March as we move on to remote online exam one of the sessions we will cover out how the previous remote Roes were conducted what were the scenarios that were felt scenarios that were used earlier and then we also will walk you through how uh give you instructions on how the current terms R will be okay sir I sir what is take or take home open internet like project yes so projects are basically again so so one of the things is",
  "are basically again so so one of the things is projects one and two will be based out of data set either you have to web scrape the data set from a particular uh portal and then have a set of questions based on that web the data that you have scraped it can be a data that you fetch from API and then uh get it so it's it's not something I would say the pro problem statement is not something uh uh defined it depends upon the uh data set that you have so but uh the Crux of or the structure the of",
  "so but uh the Crux of or the structure the of the project will basically be there a data set or multiple data sets and following set of questions based on the data set you would definitely need to use the tools that you have learned to extract the data transform the data and then do uh any kind of uh evaluation or any kind of calculations on top of data to arrive at The Final Answer sir sorry for interrupting sir I just had one more question about the take-home projects sir can you tell us the",
  "the take-home projects sir can you tell us the weeks which are related to the specific uh take-home projects like for project one which weeks we'll have the content that we need to know about yeah uh basically uh yeah go ahead thanks yeah so uh the projects will cover um most of the things that would have been uh done in the prior weeks okay so for example project one if you look at the date 17 so it will typically cover everything you've done up till probably llms and most likely include some",
  "till probably llms and most likely include some data sourcing so those are the kind of things that will probably be tested in Project one um and uh the other thing to remember is you know you've got a long time we've given deliberately given you a long time to try and solve it I mean it's generally it used to be only 10 days okay but you're getting virtually an entire month to try and solve project one uh but take that as a serious indication of the kind of level of effort you'll have to put in",
  "the kind of level of effort you'll have to put in into project okay you'll have to really think about how you solve uh they will be very interesting um I can promise you these projects will be quite uh fascinating to work on and it will give you a real glimpse into some of the amazing things that um uh that's possible nowadays you know and uh you none of your CS degree Majors or most of you aren CS degree Majors but the things you will be doing in this project uh will be so fantastic it'll just",
  "this project uh will be so fantastic it'll just blow your mind and you'll think wow you know when you achieve that and you do that you'll think you know I've done something that is truly valuable so take it seriously and uh it will like I said it will cover mostly uh the first four or five modules uh uh when you're doing project one and project two will most likely cover a much wider range of things because it comes much later uh in the course sir I have a question uh so I tried the ga and I",
  "sir I have a question uh so I tried the ga and I have some half big idea about all these tools I was able to resolve it but it doesn't mean I have a great understanding of all this somehow I manage it so what would be your advice to me should I continue or should I drop the course system uh if you have managed it then that's great because that's uh this is not meant to make you a professional in any of these tools it is meant to introduce you to the tools and then where you take it from there",
  "the tools and then where you take it from there is uh is totally um up to each individual so if you Managed IT that's uh that's uh that's really good because really that's all anyone is asking you to do is to get to the answers solve the Sol you know solve the things that are required it means you've got at least a fun fundamental understanding of how to get started with it and then where you take it and how you use it in the future is is completely down to you and where you use it and deploy",
  "down to you and where you use it and deploy it also I'm direct to diploma DS student uh right so uh how is this this course like is it more inclined towards programming or is it more inclined towards DS uh what should be our expectation from this course after we complete yeah it is it is definitely programming heavy and um uh with what you can expect at the end of it is uh you'll have some skills with some certain tools you'll have exposure to the tools that are required in order to be able to",
  "tools that are required in order to be able to do your data science projects effectively and U uh produce something of value for your uh either for your employers or in your business or any other U place where you deploy data science answers for any projects that you do sir sir sorry to interrupt I'm also direct entry sorry sorry yeah just go ahead yeah uh so you mentioned that uh there are multiple tools and these tools are changing ever changing so there should be some kind of a b basic tool",
  "so there should be some kind of a b basic tool that is pretty much standard uh throughout a longer period of time so what should we be focusing more on and which tools will be like uh standard so that we can have better understanding of those that's um that's a good question um as far as standard tools uh you bash has been around since the 70s right so I mean I don't quite know how to answer that question um but again you know there are going to be experts in using the L The Bash terminal",
  "to be experts in using the L The Bash terminal they're going to be experts in using databases who have a specialized job just dealing with databases um there are going to be people that uh you know are experts at various of these very old tools but uh they're still current uh currently used um so I mean that's a very sort of I think the way you can answer that question is maybe just look up on Reddit or something and you will get a sense of what uh what have what tools have been around for",
  "what uh what have what tools have been around for donkey years and what are fairly new I mean the main thing the main new things are like uh using llms using gpts um to extract um structured data from unstructured data that's a that's a really powerful thing that could not be done in the past very easily um so that something um if I were you uh today you know getting ready for the market that's out there I would focus on developing your skills in this new field okay because there will be a lot",
  "this new field okay because there will be a lot of people who know these old things okay and they're not it's not that they're not useful they are useful that's why we're sharing how to use them or at least have the basic understanding to use them so you can do useful work with it but uh I think being focused on new and upcoming things that uh that is the future uh would serve you quite well uh whereas you can always get some certification for some of the other things like Linux or uh uh you",
  "some of the other things like Linux or uh uh you know databases and things of that sort though you can there are specific certifications for those if you want to go down that route but that's not the focus of this course the focus of this course is to introduce you to the tools and then teach you some some very useful new things that are being used at the moment to keep you current with the the industry so just adding on to your point so what if what if we uh want to learn these tools deeper",
  "if what if we uh want to learn these tools deeper because I'm a direct entry diploma in data science student and these are uh comparatively very new tools for me so what if we want to learn the basics and then take a deeper dive into these tools yeah so it's something what all of us do I mean um I learned most of these tools by just uh using them more and more frequently in whatever workflows I have um it's the same for any of the T who have done this um uh it's this the same for all of us we",
  "this um uh it's this the same for all of us we if we find something interesting then we just take and run with it so I'll give you one example there was a student not this term not uh not last term but the term before and uh he was so inspired by one of the videos that was shown uh and it was not even a graded um uh learning objective okay it was using Excel to make this 3D um flyby of um um uh Starbucks coffee shops versus McDonald's coffee shops okay uh first of all it used tools that you had",
  "okay uh first of all it used tools that you had to pay for um and um so we didn't test people on it but we showcased it okay what was possible he was so blown away by that capability that an inspired by it that he decided to uh create his own flyby and use it for uh expressing uh dominoes versus Pizza H in Bangalore okay and he used that to Showcase it to his employer you know and they were quite impressed by the project that he had deployed so that's an example of someone who we introduced the",
  "an example of someone who we introduced the tool we didn't even teach it really and he just took what was shown what was and explained and then because his he had an interest in it he took and ran with it so that's all it is right whatever is on here if you find something that really helps you in your workflow and you think hey you know if I learn this tool this can really help me with this so you know if it's something as simple as markdown right um we you know you you once you start learning",
  "um we you know you you once you start learning marketing you think hey you know this is actually good for doing documentation and things of that sort uh you may begin to use a tool for example like uh I think it's obsidian uh which is done in markdown and you know it's great for organizing your documents organizing your notes and if you know how to do use markdown well then it improves your your efficiency across so many domains right so it just depends on uh on how you uh use the tool in your",
  "depends on uh on how you uh use the tool in your workflow and uh when you find something useful then you can just get deeper into it it's something that comes out of your own self-interest and in your own uh projects and workflows that you have also just one one one thing about obsidian try to make one folder per your per an area in your life or something right because otherwise you'll just have a lot of vaults and every a lot of vaults or folders so it's just better kind of have like a",
  "folders so it's just better kind of have like a Knowledge Graph approach and there is also a learning system or something I'll probably try and find a yeah and that's a good good example right yeah really better yeah so that's a good example right so you can go down the rabbit hole of markdown and obsidian and from a simple markdown suddenly you've got can band boards and you've got a learning system you've got knowledge graphs so many deep things you can have from it just from a simple tool",
  "you can have from it just from a simple tool like markdown so it really just depends on how deep you want to go with something we will not uh teach you all those deep things right we are just showing you hey this is a tool that can be used for these things and now it's up to you to find the inspiration to go forward with it and use it in your daily life sir I have a doubt just a small one can I ask yeah go ahead sir I'm a non IT background uh student I've done Masters in mathematics so is it",
  "student I've done Masters in mathematics so is it possible uh is it okay that I'll do uh data uh diploma in data science only and uh get uh and find an opportunity in it sector that's a difficult question for me to answer specifically um it's always possible um but I can't really answer to the specifics of what you've asked uh uh because it really depends on where you're working what the company requires there there's lot of things uh involved with it right so so sir it is it uh it is always",
  "with it right so so sir it is it uh it is always good to take diploma in programming as well with the diploma in data science I would say programming skills these days uh are very valuable in in many fields because uh you know if you look at uh just to give you a very uh simple example right so if you go to the chemistry Department here okay and uh on campus uh I was surprised they were hiring data scientists okay and I was thinking why are they hiring data science for chemistry I mean just out",
  "hiring data science for chemistry I mean just out of curiosity and I heard they were working on uh they they wanted someone who was skilled at using uh llm agents and I'm thinking why does chemistry Department need llm agent Pro coders okay there and or people who are knowledgeable with data science and llm agents and then I find out it's because they want to uh make their all their course material available in Swahili for the Tanzania campus uh so that's an example right uh you know it's it",
  "uh so that's an example right uh you know it's it seems completely disconnected and dis you know not related to each other but um when you some some programming skills you're able to then um easily transfer information from one point to another and that's uh that's what data science is about right so having some coding skills will definitely get you ahead of the game because otherwise your data you may have a nice beautiful model and you may have all the ma beautiful mathematics behind it but",
  "all the ma beautiful mathematics behind it but if you can't deliver the data in a form that someone can use then it just sits on a on a system somewhere right without being useful so so that's what this course is kind of about this diploma and data science so and tools for data science is a very I think a very crucial Lynch pin of that of how to get your get you from the theory to the real world okay sir thank you sir sir so uh diploma uh diploma in data sence also have some uh skills in",
  "diploma in data sence also have some uh skills in programming so uh uh in it is just additional to diploma in programming that it will add some more skills in programming as well in data science yeah definitely yeah I mean they work well together so that's why you got the two track diploma which is the diploma and programming and the diploma in data science yeah okay thank you sir okay I think we can wind up the session then today um uh tomorrow we will have a session is scheduled for 8: to 10:",
  "we will have a session is scheduled for 8: to 10: and um we will try and see if um we can organize uh What uh content will be covered in these various sessions uh so that uh you have a better idea of um what skill level we are targeting with these sessions uh and if you can't attend them also uh they will be recorded all the sessions for this term we will try to bookmark uh them with chapters um so that you can quickly access the content that is relevant to you so these are some new things",
  "is relevant to you so these are some new things we're going to try we may not always get it correct but uh we're going to try and uh deliver for you on these fronts okay sir sorry to interrupt sir will the sessions which will be like uh as you said bookmarked and will be newly added sir will they be updated to the Google Calendar for the course so there is a playlist on the Google Calendar uh at the moment it's empty obviously because this is the first session uh for Jan term on on the calendar",
  "first session uh for Jan term on on the calendar so uh they will they will be put in that playlist and you can access that playlist uh book what I would say is bookmark the uh TDS uh Channel as well uh that will help you find the playlist um but you should be able to access so the video itself you may not get access directly from the calendar this we get this question every term they will see a link and it will show the video that we do not share okay you will actually be able to see the video",
  "okay you will actually be able to see the video only through YouTube through the YouTube channel that's the only way to access the video okay thank you sir s since you are on campus can you kind of uh make a request to the faculty of uh the programming uh part like the diploma in programming that at Le Le we should have something similar to TDs in the programming component in which we are also introduced data providers instead of just the local data which we using with SQ SQ and and dat Prov",
  "data which we using with SQ SQ and and dat Prov what yeah what I would suggest is uh if you actually put a discourse on and tag you know some of the people who run the program that will be probably a good way to um ra the issue already finished it but I'll probably put it on this course okay so um um we are way past our normal schedule um so thank you folks um we'll meet again tomorrow and JJ will be handling tomorrow session I'll be in attendance as well and uh there will also be San will also",
  "as well and uh there will also be San will also be joining us um and we will see you tomorrow okay and uh we look forward to uh being able to do good great things in this course okay all right good night guys thank you sir thank you sir thank you sir",

  "uh hello all hey hi hi I'm JJ uh Tools in data science da today what I doing I will be going through a different concepts that are covered in week two and we try to give you some idea about how you can solve those questions that are part of week one gr assignment I won't be discussing the exact solution but I will be guiding through how you can reach to the solutions yeah like U like um I'm speaking on my behalf is like uh we had a discussion and Carlton clear like he has outlined that uh we",
  "and Carlton clear like he has outlined that uh we might not be discussing everything in detail but like uh but though uh we like a bit of idea what tools will be we will be using so that will be discussed so eagerly waiting for you to start okay I was waiting for if somebody else was wants to join so now I'll share my screen so so we currently we are discussing week one graded assignment questions from week two no we won't be discussing week two we will be discussing week one right now because",
  "we will be discussing week one right now because this is week two I think we'll be discussing it in the next week right [Music] so uh this is first question of graded assignment which so basically here it tells about the importance of vs code and then 70 5% of the users developers use vs code and then there is some tutorials on how you can install vs code and then there's some how you can add it and then code in vs code and these are some productivity tips and then you can personalize the theme",
  "tips and then you can personalize the theme and those things then you can add extensions that that that gives you more features on top of what vs code offers and then this is debugging tools and then this is something useful Version Control in vs code this is some visual tool kind of thing and then these are other shortcut configuration and settings that you can change so this particular question just requires us to install vs code and then uh in the terminal you run this particular command and",
  "the terminal you run this particular command and whatever output comes you just based it on this input box so this doesn't have any um this doesn't have any technical part so I I won't be discussing this question and up uh so can anyone just confirm uh is my voice audible to all of you yes sir sure okay thanks so question is there a possibility to shift this weekly toida I will discuss if it is possible or not but these STDs sessions uh we used to record them and we also used to upload them on",
  "to record them and we also used to upload them on YouTube so if not possible then you can watch it from YouTube recordings but I will ask if something can happen uh sure sir if something is possible uh please let let us know because both are technically very heavy and I'm not that good in technical things so it'll be good if it is possible to shift it okay so this is one command line tool this is called U and here they have given directions to install UV on different operating systems for",
  "to install UV on different operating systems for example for if you're using Windows then these are the uh commands that you can execute in order to install UV and then you can even install it using just pip uh package manager and if you want if you have Mac OS or Linux then these are the um so this is just a script that is available somewhere on internet and then you can curl it and then you can just uh execute this script and if Cur is not there on your system neither you can install Cur or",
  "on your system neither you can install Cur or you can even use wget and then this is for a particular uh version of UV command in case if you want to install a particular version so uh the benefit of using UV is that you don't have to create virtual environments and those things uh you just have to include some little portions of cod and then you can just uh run the application with the minimal setup so now what I will do I will create Oneal environment and then I will show how we generally use",
  "and then I will show how we generally use to run any program k 16 okay U just give me one minute I be back in one minute e e e e uh hello Shan can you confirm if am I audible or not yeah you are audible J you are audible okay is there any background noise from my side uh little bit but not that much uh okay so just give me some time [Music] uh hello uh can you see something now uh are you trying to share your screen jaaj uh no no I'm just checking some connectivity with the audio device that I",
  "some connectivity with the audio device that I using uh sharan I'm facing some issues with uh hearing voice of others so can you take over for some time I will restart my system all right all right not a problem all right guys uh let's have a little introduction about myself I am San seni and uh I'm going to be your ta for this term for uh this Jan to uh April term and uh this is my first time being a TA of TDS and I hope that I would be able to help you guys in achieving great grades and great",
  "help you guys in achieving great grades and great marks in uh TDS along with that uh I wish I would be helpful uh for you to understand Concepts and learn new things at TDS all right so uh if you guys have any uh you know any doubts or any any uh academic DDS you have you want to ask something you want some suggestions on some projects you are doing you are currently pursuing you can free feel to you just feel uh free to connect with me on discour all right and uh so uh because jvrj is busy uh",
  "all right and uh so uh because jvrj is busy uh he's facing some problems uh I can just take over and uh let me share my screen okay just a second I we'll have to uh set up something all right so this was our G1 and I guess uh jvrj was able to explain you guys about UV uh I guess something uh UV was uh partially completed by him and uh I would like to leave that portion to him uh okay let's just see so how is how is you UV getting knitted back to vs code like are they are they do they work in",
  "to vs code like are they are they do they work in compliance or how it is exactly are using in the vs code actually you can use UV in your uh I guess you can use UV in your command prompt as well because just like pip you have Pip in for python you have npx for JavaScript or nodejs you can use UV UV is like a replacement for that so you can use UV in the command prompt as well so like uh is there is like do we have example where we we are using it or any any example examples where it",
  "are using it or any any example examples where it demonstrates where how we are using it and like how to integrate it with vs code like well there is no such thing as integrating it with vs code uh just like you can run uh any command like you can just open up your uh command prompt and you can run some command in PIP uh without actually uh just a second I guess I have have to share my entire screen Shan am I audible now uh yes you're a okay so now my audio devices are working so I can take",
  "so now my audio devices are working so I can take over on question too all right not a problem so is it Anand miti that asked the question yeah yeah okay so just to quickly tag on to what you asked about UV so usually UV is um useful from a point of view of deployability so let's imagine like say for example you wrote a python script file uh it works great on your system that's uh you know usually uh good enough for most people but then you want to share that um with someone else and that's",
  "to share that um with someone else and that's usually where the use case becomes useful so typically when you deploy a project with someone else they will have to mimic your uh system exactly uh the your runtime environment your uh dependencies all the things that go with your project they will have to mirror it so in the past uh you know one one approach to it would have been they would have to create a virtual environment they would have to pip install from the requirements.txt and uh they",
  "pip install from the requirements.txt and uh they would also have to in some cases your libraries would only work with certain versions of python so it would perhaps work with python 3.9 your application it might actually break in say 3.13 or something okay so there are all these issues there are all these steps that we have to take in order to have someone else run your application um so last term uh in Project two there was an excellent working example of how UV can be used and mass okay so",
  "example of how UV can be used and mass okay so there were 600 submissions of students 600 python files that they submitted and uh the the question becomes how do we automate uh running all those applications with their own set of unique requirements with their own set of uh libraries and we don't know ahead of time what those Library requirements are and what those uh dependencies are what uh runtime environment they had we didn't have any clue right so we want to evaluate 687 submissions",
  "clue right so we want to evaluate 687 submissions automated so the only thing we required them to do is in their python file they would put a small block at the top which specified uh what python uh version and the library that were required that's it okay and it would be at the top of their code block then we receive the file and with a single single uh command line instruction we are able to pass through all 687 submissions regardless of the runtime environment in other words UV dynamically",
  "runtime environment in other words UV dynamically for each one that was run would dynamically generate them and once it was done with running the script it would dispose of the uh of the of the things that were required so so um we didn't have to recreate different setups for each uh script so that's one use case example uh you know where you you can iterative iteratively go through a large number of automation of scripts without um all the fuss that is usually involved with setting it up so",
  "that is usually involved with setting it up so does that give you an idea of what UI can do yeah so uh that's there like uh I got like rather than specifying like for each one of them uh while collaborating it helps irrespective of what versions are being used so that is one thing so while starting when there like uh since we have to run a code in order to give uh give an answer so does that like uh does that work specifically for vs code or like once it's installed it is going to work for all",
  "once it's installed it is going to work for all other ID whichever it is yeah it works in any circumstance so you use the vs code only to edit your code right but when you're running it you can uh run run your code um just by typing UV run and the python file name that you're trying to initialize your application from and that's it that's all it takes okay okay okay okay okay okay so so you don't have to create a virtual environment you don't have to pip install anything you just um just give",
  "to pip install anything you just um just give the starting point of your application and it it just runs okay so so so so in the following exam like uh in the following class uh we like we will like we will be able to see um where it is being used yes yeah yeah okay I think JRA will probably go go over an example with you as well so okay okay that works that works um can I ask a question uh hi her yeah so um yeah I've Sol this first one actually like uh I just want to know like there were two",
  "like uh I just want to know like there were two things which were mentioned there if you get like I I got 10 but actually I didn't do it with the first try uh I got some score and afterwards I gave up and after some time actually had sometime so I did it actually maybe I would have taken like two to three hours but it gave two conditions one is like if you do within two hours and if you get above eight then you get s or a grade what does it mean that format is it no it's just uh you can uh see",
  "that format is it no it's just uh you can uh see uh even if you don't do do it in two hours then also you will get good grade CU time is not bounded so deadline for this assignment is 26 no no no I'm not talking about this I'm talking about like the Roe exam which is there like uh it says it's 45 minutes like the question paper P will be like this format or like uh how is it like uh format will be same questions will be there and uh these answer boxes will be there and then you can even use",
  "boxes will be there and then you can even use whatever tools you want to use it will be non proed exam uh what I mean is this is like mostly search based and some uh tool based so like this only we are expecting is it or something else it will be similar to all the concept that are taught so Ro will happen after 8 weeks so anything can be asked in R and something new can also be there okay thank you excuse me uh yes sorry to interrupt sir I had to ask this question in last orientation session",
  "to ask this question in last orientation session but I couldn't sir unlike the other courses this course only had eight only has eight weeks so will it the eight weeks go along simultaneously like one after the another or will there be breaks or the times will be different from other courses or something so because other courses has 12 weeks in a general manner yeah so so course timeline information is available right over here when which assignment will get released so if any assignment gets",
  "will get released so if any assignment gets released all the content that is related to assignment will also get released so those things can be found here so for example it starts on 30th of December and then it ends on 26th so all these deadlines are here excuse me sir very good evening uh hi en uh so actually I has a doubt like uh all the concept which were taught in the week one like introductory we uh do we need to uh build the like advanced level or some more than basic level in the first",
  "level or some more than basic level in the first week only or we are just we will just learn them week by week so every week we'll have different content in it so they have graded assignments and then these content links are also here here so all of them are also part of creed assignment itself Yes actually the UV part the project manager as uh there was only 7 Minute video so uh basically uh I the question I was able to ask that if you need to learn the UV like for the full extent uh in the",
  "learn the UV like for the full extent uh in the week one only or we just uh learn it in the upcoming weeks uh UV is there in week one only but there is one um most usual way of UV is you put everything in the inline met script and then you run your code and you don't have to create virtual environment that is the useful thing about UV so uh sir how do we start the project we'll have some other session for uh guidance related to project okay sir all [Applause] right so I have already shown the",
  "all [Applause] right so I have already shown the installation part of UV so if you go here on this particular web page here they have installations for different to for example for Windows these are the commands that you would need to run and you can even use pip to install UV and if you have Mac OS then these are different ways so you can do curl and then then you get the script and then you execute that particular script so these are different ways to install UV on your system depending on",
  "ways to install UV on your system depending on the operating system that you have now I will create a basic script that makes use of UV so I will import pandas and then as PD and then I will read a CSC file using pandas and then I will just do print DF do info maybe so I have this particular CS file now I will download it sorry to interrupt sir sir do we get the screen recording of this session yes the session will be uploaded to YouTube and you will find the recording of the session yeah okay",
  "will find the recording of the session yeah okay and uh now I'm going to execute uh theore CSV dop okay so it gets us all these uh information about these particular fields that is because I have installed pandas in my global environment how do I so what I will doip and how do I remove a python package can [Music] you have a permission denied error J so it's that's the same [Music] okay exion [Music] okay [Music] [Music] excuse me sir your voice is not properly audible uh actually I'm trying to",
  "is not properly audible uh actually I'm trying to uninstall pandas as of now but for some reason I'm not able to uninstall it uh JRA uh we can do one thing uh perhaps we can uh use another Library which might have not been installed in your device and then we can run a python script for that like for example tensor flow or escalar okay give me examp so this is kind of a good example of why UI is good okay so imagine his uh Panda's installation was corrupted and now he's uh has to get it somehow",
  "corrupted and now he's uh has to get it somehow extricated from his system before he can do anything else so it's a good way of you know not having to deal with these issues and this is where UI really shines because you would not have this permanently system anywhere and so it doesn't damage his system configuration or anything of that sort if you use I think psychic learn should not be there on my local system so now I will try to execute this particular file and it gets me the error that uh",
  "particular file and it gets me the error that uh this particular module is not found and in order to execute this file either I have to I have to install sqn module GL globally or I will have to create a virtual environment for running this uh file but instead of doing that what I can do I can write some inline Mata script and we can use that script python so this tells while we are executing the script which python version should should be used and then which all dependencies are required to",
  "and then which all dependencies are required to execute the script so for this particular script we will require to use uh sker module how to install learn I think this is the name of the module and now I will execute this particular file using UV command and it is installing CPI it is installing escalar it is also installing numai those are I think dependency sub depend sub dependencies that escalar requires now we have finished downloading all the dependencies and then it prints the accuracy",
  "the dependencies and then it prints the accuracy of uh on the test data set that is there so basically purpose of this uh this this code is not to explain how escalar modules Works uh the purpose of this code was to exp explain how U you can use UV command to just put all the dependencies that are there that needs for executing this file and you can mention all these dependencies by separating them using commas so what is the exact uh requirement and what what what format should be followed in",
  "and what what what format should be followed in order to like like like this is the first step after after this we have to follow that and then this is what is we are going to expect out of that so steps are as following you first need to install UV command so if you go to this particular URL it have all the different uh installations that are there and then maybe it have some code to um running is scripts maybe it have some examples of some script so for example this is one script yeah uh so",
  "so for example this is one script yeah uh so this is the one which requires to install some external packages so it is importing request and then it is also importing Rich package okay uh so then it is sending some requests to a endpoint and then it is just printing something so in order to use request Library you will have to install it globally or locally but instead you can put it inside the metadata script so all you have to do is you in you first install UV command once it's installed you",
  "first install UV command once it's installed you will have you have the script this is usual a python script and on top of that you will include the metad script over here and then your code will look like something like this and then you will execute uh the file us UV run read csvp whatever is name of that python module so first we need to install that on our local machine is that yes okay and then from there like uh while we are trying to do that uh we have to write the script of the",
  "to do that uh we have to write the script of the dependencies over there in the in whatever ID we are using and from there onwards and then you execute the file okay so uh like this part will remain same whether you use UV or you no no that is there that is there so the dep the dependencies are written on the top and that uh this vs code uh but you are trying to execute it from a command prompt so like because because if I run this particular but if I if I hit this button then what it does it",
  "if I if I hit this button then what it does it will use Python to execute this uh script mhm and I don't want to use that so either I can configure this button so if I just execute this so what it does it will uh get the python from its binary file and then it will execute this file but I don't want to do this because I want to execute it using UV so that's why I will use I just send question to directory run this is what we'll have to use uh excuse me uh yes while putting in the directory for",
  "me uh yes while putting in the directory for the specific file like you named for question two don't you have to put in more address for it like in which drive it is and where it is you just put in question to directly does that work like all the time uh it works because I'm executing the script from the same directory if I go to previous directory and then I use UV run it won't be able to identify that particular file but then if I just mention the directory here then it will again execute the",
  "the directory here then it will again execute the file so you will have to provide the correct path either you can provide relative path or you can provide the absolute path okay then this npx what it allows you to do you can uh execute some JavaScript code using npx and this npx in instead of npm which allow instead of downloading these modules in the uh Global name space it will down download those things in local so that uh uh if there are multiple projects on your system then it won't",
  "multiple projects on your system then it won't affect other projects if you're using some other version of prettier for some other application then uh you can you you won't be having any issues while using it show SC C uh another example for npx can be uh when you are trying to develop some kind of project let's say you are using a framework like uh uh react or next so these two are Frameworks which are used for web development projects and uh when you are trying to create projects using",
  "uh when you are trying to create projects using Frameworks so what it does is it will install those packages which you are going to use in that project in that particular environment itself so that would be exclus that environment would be ex exclusively used for that particular project and it won't be affecting your uh it won't be globally affecting your uh what can I say the the other projects that you have been doing in other directories so npx is one example for this and there is another uh",
  "is one example for this and there is another uh uh what there is another one which is called Yan so Yan is another uh type of tool which can be used instead of npx and it said that Yan is much more faster and much more power ful than npx as well so that can be another option for you if you're trying to uh uh uh you know if you're trying to develop projects in using Frameworks or some other kind of projects if you're doing yeah I don't have to do this and if I just execute [Music] it in of app.",
  "this and if I just execute [Music] it in of app. GS it should be so what we are trying to do over here uh just trying to run some basic hello from npx code using so this is just some JavaScript code which I am trying to run using npx [Applause] actually the thing with the JavaScript is that you can't run it outside your browser so earlier when I guess in early 80s or 90s it the JavaScript was limited to your browser itself so when uh you're trying to run JavaScript on your device not using a",
  "to run JavaScript on your device not using a browser so for that to a bridge that gap between a browser and your device npx or npm is used so npm is like a global it will just globally install your libraries and packages it will affect it will be running on a global scale on your entire device and npx will be working on a like on an exclusive environment basis rather than a global basis all right so that's what we are actually trying to do so using npx or npm in your device will allow you to",
  "using npx or npm in your device will allow you to run JavaScript program on in your like we are doing in US code so it's possible only using npm or npx otherwise you won't be able to run your JavaScript programs so it supplements kind supplements the project like if uh if if we can say it in lemon uh language uh by supplement if you mean uh that it allows you to uh run JavaScript code in your project then yes otherwise you will have to open a browser each every time when you have to create a",
  "browser each every time when you have to create a JavaScript code and then you have to run on that particular browser and that's very tedious and that's why there was a guy I don't remember his name and he created this engine no no what I'm saying is here what while we are doing the npx thing so here when we are using it in this vs code like I'm I'm trying to relate everything with the vs code since that is an ID which we will be using so uh while we are doing that so npx so what role is npx",
  "we are doing that so npx so what role is npx playing over here it's creating a separate environment for a SE for a for a singular project like all the dependencies which are being used in that project will be installed via npx uh yes so npx what just like you said that npx would be installing those dependencies which you're going to use in your uh code on a local basis rather than a global [Music] sir uh is this npx running primarily on Linux system or something because in Powershell few of the",
  "or something because in Powershell few of the commands which I was actually given in the question that sh 256 some and somehow I found out that it does not work on Powers shell only works with Linux uh npx works on both the powers shell and Bash but sham it doesn't work on Windows I think what you can do is you can run this npx command separately like as you can see that in this uh in this entire command there's a pipe operator there is a pipe over here and you can execute the code which is",
  "over here and you can execute the code which is before that pipe you in your powership and then you can use a sham on that entire file so sham would be sham I guess it's it only runs in bash script in yeah it only runs in on bash script and uh so yes you can just execute this code separately first you will be executing it in Powers shell and then you can take out the shum of the entire file so what uh uh Shan is trying to say if you run this particular file command so then you will get some",
  "particular file command so then you will get some output on Terminal instead of outputting it to the terminal you can ex put it inside a file and then you can use S shasham on that particular file in Bash and then this question is related to Google Sheets so so it is about this particular function so you can try it out it won't work in Excel it will only be work it will only work in Google sheet so I will just uh miss this but I I I won't be discussing this particular question then regarding",
  "this particular question then regarding this usage of excel question so uh there so if you don't have paid version of excel then you might not be able to use it and if you don't have the paid version of excel then what you can do there is uh online version of excel which you can use I think if you go on Microsoft and then if you to do a sign up here since I already had account and it just signed in now I have signed in using my account and then over here I can create Excel file and then I can",
  "over here I can create Excel file and then I can use all those uh Excel formulas that requires some that requires you to activate uh Excel on your local system so it removes the activation part if you don't have it so you don't have to pay for using Excel if you use the online version uh Shan oh yeah I will be taking this one is my screen visible yes it is visible all right so this question involves the usage of Dev tools so what are Dev tools uh firstly I'll be combining two questions together",
  "firstly I'll be combining two questions together so I'll be talking about what are Dev tools and then I'll be talking about what are CSS selectors so I'll be just combining these two things because they have quite a bit of similarity uh with themselves between the all right so let's see what are Dev tools okay if you do a right click on your browser let me just hide it once okay if you do a right click on your browser and here you will see at the very bottom you will see an inspect option okay",
  "very bottom you will see an inspect option okay if you open it you can see that here is an entire world of code and everything about this entire website so it's like it's very interesting uh these Dev tools are really interesting for someone who has uh interest in web development or some kind of or related fields as you can see that the entire code of this website is present over here okay uh you can see the HTML code uh you can see different type of uh javascripts you can see the CSS files you",
  "of uh javascripts you can see the CSS files you can see everything and uh if let's say I want to check uh like I I want to check where this particular uh line where this particular piece of text is written in this entire code so how I can do is I can simply click over here as you can see this on in the at the very uh top at the top right corner of this inspect menu you can see that here is an arrow you can simply click over here then you will hover over this hover over the uh requir over the",
  "hover over this hover over the uh requir over the required uh uh element you want to inspect then just simply click on it and here you can see that we have got the uh H2 the particular code where this brow where this particular text has been written in this code I can simply change this let's say uh let's make it Dev uh just make it Dev all right also we can do uh you know we can do s various kind of things with this if I want to change uh like just for fun if I want to change the number of",
  "just for fun if I want to change the number of marks I will be awarded for this particular question let's say I will make it 100 so solving this question will give me 100 marks somehow okay so you can have pretty a lot of fun with Dev tools over here uh like uh for instance if uh let me open uh YouTube and uh okay let's search for something let's search for a famous song okay so I guess most of you must be familiar with this famous song and let's open this one it almost has a billion views I",
  "open this one it almost has a billion views I guess yeah yeah it has 8 billion views I guess discounts to amounts to 8 billion views so that's a really popular song what we can do is just for fun let's do one thing let's change this to a number of our desire okay we can simply in how did I how did I reach over here I simply left clicked on this particular element on this particular uh piece of text and then I clicked on inspect okay and here the in the dev tools have been opened for me and now",
  "in the dev tools have been opened for me and now I can just have some fun with myself okay let's change this to let's say uh 500 views okay 594 views and uh you can see that this has been reflected on this entire page but let let me remind you that this is just for you so this is just for you and nobody else would be able to see the these CH these types of changes which you have done in the on the page because obviously if these changes would have been reflected to everyone that would have",
  "have been reflected to everyone that would have created a whole kind of mess all right so uh these things are limited to your own device to your own browser you can have any kind of uh you can do any kind of things with this uh you can you know uh you can delete elements let's say if I want to delete this uh let's say I want to change this uh the name Louis F's name to my name okay so it's my song now okay so there's it's my channel now which have 32 million views 32 million subscribers so you",
  "32 million views 32 million subscribers so you can have all these kind of uh fun things with inspect tools with Dev tools and it's kind of fun you can even change color settings for instance uh the color of this the background color of YouTube is black over here because I have selected Black theme but you can change it to any color of a desire uh guess it would be some somewhere here okay let's see does it change okay it's somewhere hidden inside I guess also I'm changing the colors from this",
  "I guess also I'm changing the colors from this menu as you can see the entire uh CSS you can see the entire CSS over this on this menu and the entire HTML content is over here okay so it kind of gives you an entire it gives you the power to manipulate the entire page to our heart's content okay you can do a lot of things which you might might like uh some people do it for fun uh others do it for inspiration let's say uh for instance I like to create websites and uh I have created a you know",
  "create websites and uh I have created a you know couple of websites and for kind of for the kind of you know uh ideas I some sometimes go to uh I sometimes resort to Dev tools and just check out if I find a website which has a really intricate design uh which I would like to you know uh use in my website so I would go there and just use inspect tools to see okay what kind of set what kind of colors they're using what kind of uh shapes they're using so that's really interesting and really it",
  "using so that's really interesting and really it helps a developer to create new websites or new pages all right uh let's leave that background part I guess it's you know it's hidden somewhere else let's change the font color of this particular text all right let's do one thing uh we can simply write a CSS over here as you can see it also allows you to write some CSS or HTML code in inside this if I change this color let's say okay it's changing as you can see as I'm hovering over as I'm you",
  "as you can see as I'm hovering over as I'm you know uh moving my pressing my down arrow key it's changing the colors over here let's do this one now it looks much better yeah so you can see this you can change any kind of things with this you can play along with this I would encourage you guys I would really encourage you guys to play along with these Dev tools just open up some uh you know some website and make some changes have some fun and uh it would be really uh it would really uh you will",
  "it would be really uh it would really uh you will really like it you will really enjoy it also you will be able to understand few things you will be able to you know know what kind of things I can do with these Dev tools and which which are really interesting okay uh the next thing this is the elements menu as you can see the next thing over here is the console menu okay the console tab I'm not I shouldn't say I should not say menu it's a console tab okay here you can run JavaScript okay I will",
  "tab okay here you can run JavaScript okay I will be coming to this when I will be talking about CSS selectors and uh for now let's just skip this one okay uh by the way anyone of you have any problems or any questions related to this uh elements tab at the moment sir I do not have a specific question to the element stab but I joined late because I got busy doing something else uh what did you discuss like uh apart from the dep tools uh what what else has been discussed apart from the de tools",
  "else has been discussed apart from the de tools we have discussed the first five questions of G1 okay and yeah the recording recording afterwards okay okay where on discourse or on the on the no not on discourse it will be available on the YouTube channel okay all right so anyone else have any problems or uh we should move on to another tab so also if you want to change the background color you can do HTML do base if you you can just search if you want to do that uh HTML dock huh the Dark theme",
  "want to do that uh HTML dock huh the Dark theme right so it inheres from that yeah HTML dark you're seeing this you'll find a base color here you're basically looking for YT base okay okay YT base okay I guess that would be that would take some of my time oh we can change this primary text color as well this is I guess this has been disabled because I am using a dark theme I guess uh but I leave okay here here it is the HTML talk uh let's change this one it's not changing try again it's not",
  "this one it's not changing try again it's not changing all right I will give this uh exercise to you guys you can uh go ahead and check out which kind which particular uh CSS El to change the color of the background color of uh YouTube so yeah this can be done and this can be this is an exercise for you guys all right so let's move on to the console menu because you guys have no other uh questions all right let's move ahead so the console menu I'll be skipping for now because I'll be discussing",
  "be skipping for now because I'll be discussing about that in some uh amount of time okay after this I I'll will be discussing about the console menu so next comes a source okay so here you can see the uh where all these uh where the elements of these I guess this is where the elements are being fetched from okay we can skip this one as well okay okay so now we come to the networks menu all right for this I will be opening my own personal website which is this one because I'm much more familiar",
  "which is this one because I'm much more familiar with my own website rather than YouTube okay so this is my own personal website uh my portfolio website okay and now we can see how we can use the networks menu okay the networks tab so over here the networks tab actually actually it contains all those kind of all those uh you know all those links all those uh uh uh as you can see that we are getting like it's fetching all this content so here here you can see that all these all this text and all",
  "you can see that all these all this text and all these kind of uh all these uh things that which have been populated over here it's fetching it some from somewhere okay so it is fetch when it's fetching it from somewhere that is being logged in in this networks man in this networks tab all right for instance uh just a second all right for instance if if I go to like about my about menu page uh okay I'm in the about menu page let's reload it okay you can see that it has fetched some things okay",
  "you can see that it has fetched some things okay it has fetched the education it has fetched extra about scale and about app so these kind of things are actually the Json files which it's EXT which it's uh fetching it from the uh place which it has been deployed to okay so if I just open this particular uh sptify it so if I just double click on this educations uh option you can see that here we are getting the entire Javas the the Json object so Json is an object which will be uh which it's",
  "so Json is an object which will be uh which it's fetching from the place it has been deployed to and then it's actually populating this J Json uh data to the website okay as you you can see that this is the BS in data Sense on application and yeah here it's showing you it's populating that in this particular section okay and uh uh let's go to my projects and you will see the same story over here you can see that I it has fetched a uh uh Json object if I just double click over here it's a large",
  "if I just double click over here it's a large file okay so you can just uh view the uh you know organized version of this Json file if you just uh check this box of pretty print okay so uh here you will here you can see that this is the Json object which is which it is actually fetching and then it's populating it over here okay so this is how it's working in like uh this was just a demonstration of how Network tab is uh helping us and and uh you can see all these kinds of images on you can see",
  "can see all these kinds of images on you can see this is the CSS file which I have wrote at some point of time okay so this is the CSV file which I have written and it's fetching that as well it's fetching more it's fetching some other kind of things as well along with that it's it's fetching the Json objects it's fetching the JavaScript files also it's fetching this as you can see this is the collect now what is this collect uh as far as I can remember this collect is like actually Google",
  "can remember this collect is like actually Google collecting the information like Google uses a crawler which actually uh traces each and every site and then just uh you know it uh uses search methods to see which kind like how to rank the websites when something is searched for okay so I guess this is uh the crawler doing its thing okay uh by the way you guys have any kind of questions related to this Network stab any questions if you can just reiterate uh elements had the HTML for everything",
  "reiterate uh elements had the HTML for everything right yeah HTML and CSS code no no sir HTML CSS code there was something else for CSS code right it was terminal like something here it is the element tab has the HTML over here and the CSS over here can you see this does that answer a question yes yes and uh can you say what was in the sources the sources uh the sources one okay so I guess this is where it's fetching the you know the meta tag the when you are designing a website you will you",
  "the when you are designing a website you will you will be using a meta tag over there so what does a meta tag do uh like I am fetching some Google fonts from Google okay so I'm fetching this this is a popins font which I actually like a lot so it's fetching this particular font from Google fonts and then it's able to use this font over here okay so while it's fetching this font so this is how it's telling us that this is okay so this is the uh this is the place which this font is actually",
  "uh this is the place which this font is actually coming from okay it is like that and I guess there are some elements of next because I created this website using nextjs so I guess there are some elements of nexts as well and uh yeah so that's what the source tab is uh yeah uh yeah so s what I was telling is like U uh in this short span of time I don't think so like uh the people who don't know specif specifically me who doesn't know uh this front end coding and all those things so I don't",
  "front end coding and all those things so I don't think so we will be able to grasp all the things whichever is there so why not we funnel up what what we require what we require really require in completing this uh uh this particular paper so how everything is like funneled up from starting to uh end in order to complete this uh uh like whatever the contents are there look the thing is that uh when you are saying that you want to like we should focus on what's what will help you in actually",
  "focus on what's what will help you in actually solving the ga the thing is that you are not going to be limited to the ga I just want to give you a small glimpse about these Dev tools and what you can do with uh these no no that is fine that is fine like uh the thing is like I'm not very much familiar with all these things so that is the thing that that's completely fine yeah so it keeps me wondering like where we are using it so uh an so most of the time you will be using elements tab which",
  "of the time you will be using elements tab which have all the structure of Dom after it gets populated and then you will also be using console tab where you can execute some JavaScript and that that is for uh data scrapping purpose doing something with CSS selector which is mostly that we use it in TDS so which so regarding CSS selector and usage of console tab shans will be showing in some time okay so what we are going so in this entire course the only tabs that you will be actually using",
  "the only tabs that you will be actually using will be the elements console and network okay so these are the only three tabs which you will be using the most and uh these all I'm like I'm only placing my uh emphasis on these only three types so someone asked me that's why I'm that's why I'm explaining about the source otherwise there is nothing much you can you have to do with the source tab so this element console and network only these three tabes will be of use to you in this particular",
  "tabes will be of use to you in this particular course otherwise rest all of these are not much used this go okay all right so anyone of you have any questions for these three tabs like excluding the console in these two tabs elements and network you can just raise your hand and ask me the question all right I yes uh sorry sir can you explain the network tab once more uh in a brief uh little bit okay Network tab basically it contains all the external uh all the external you know uh information",
  "uh all the external you know uh information it's grabbing from it from the place it has been deployed to so actually this this particular website which you are seeing in your in front of you this is actually uh coming from somewhere it's it has been actually deployed to a server and then it's being presented to you over here so everything that's coming from that server will be showcased over here in this network stab okay so all the JavaScript that I have written for this website all the CSS",
  "that I have written for this website all the CSS that I have written all the HTML so everything has been uh displayed to you over here for you for TDS I believe that this fetch tab this fetch uh this is actually this is a filter over here so you if you click over this all option it will show you all the links and all the images URL and everything which it has it is fetching from if you simply click over there on this fetch uh tab over here it will just show you the apis uh that it has the API",
  "just show you the apis uh that it has the API the Jon code it has fet the CSS files it has F so for TDS only this uh I guess this fetch tab will be the most useful for you this all like all the rest of the things like CSS GSS these things will not be of much use to you and in this fetch tab as well this AP this apis which is which it is actually fetching from these will be much more useful for you in the upcoming weeks okay so does that answer a question yes sir thank you sir all right sir can",
  "question yes sir thank you sir all right sir can we modify the content over this network tab or uh we can only modify the elements tab only no you can you can modify the entire structure of the website only on the elements tab sir can I add something okay sir thank you sir yeah please yeah so Network tab is basically whatever you see is whatever you're getting here it's basically whatever you're receiving right in the browser you're able to see it so uh one thing which which people who are",
  "see it so uh one thing which which people who are probably tinkering with the this network app for a long time we'll notice this a lot of videos you pre previously used to load entirely in the network tab right so you could actually uh get get that content uh if you wanted to so to prevent this uh new technologies now chunk the video so they they are broken down into several parts and then now you cannot really just uh go to the network Tab and download the entire thing right if you wanted to",
  "download the entire thing right if you wanted to that is so that is something which Engineers figured out people are messing around so they they broke it so whatever you're seeing on website whatever the browser is receiving it is there on the network tab that is why you cannot change it right like it is just something you got now you could probably filter uh a specific file type but you cannot really change anything thank you rck uh I guess this chunks which you are talking about it's done by",
  "chunks which you are talking about it's done by lazy loading if I'm not wrong there so the file is just divided into yeah la loading but like it it's like uh the the thing loads and uh you can see the video but then you cannot really uh see it as one file it is comined it is encoded in in a way in which that the the the player is able to play it but you cannot really extract it got it got it thank you for input all right so because no one has any other questions let's move to the CSS elector",
  "any other questions let's move to the CSS elector part so how we will be using it like uh how how we will be using it what things we will be changing here uh can you please uh repeat yourself so while we are using these three tabs yeah what things we should be focusing upon so for the element step you can uh for instance if there is a tab for is let let me open something uh let's say uh let's talk about um okay let's open this IM DB ratings and reviews okay okay uh search for top movies I am",
  "reviews okay okay uh search for top movies I am right all right so these are the top movies what you can do over here is like you can get a what kind of questions you can get in TDs is that uh we can ask you guys to to extract all the names of these movies which are which have been given in this entire page all the two like there are 250 movies that have been listed in this page we will ask you guys to Simply extract all these names from uh this particular page so one way is simple copy and",
  "particular page so one way is simple copy and paste copy and paste so that's really tedious and obviously that's impractical as well so how you can actually do it really quickly using Dev tools I'll be teaching you right now all right okay can do the you can either do the TDS work or we can do the TDS work that's a really good analogy thank you rck the tedious work or the tedious work that's really good okay so uh let's see how we can fetch all these the names of the movies that has been given",
  "these the names of the movies that has been given over here in one go using the console Tab and the elements St okay let's see so first and foremost we have to see that how like uh first we have to see that where this particular text has been located one way is simply uh right click over this and inspect okay and it will just simply direct you towards the particular section which uh which contains the names of these uh uh uh these movies okay and you can see over here that this particular name",
  "you can see over here that this particular name all these names are written in an element in an H3 element so H3 is heading three so you can I will just skrip over skip over that HTML part uh because it might cause confusion between those people who have not gone through mad one and mad 2 okay so what you can do over here is that we will see that all these ele all these name all these elements which contain the name of these movies will actually have the class this this exact class they all",
  "have the class this this exact class they all will have this exact class we can uh let's just confirm this again it has this IPC title text class in every one of these uh in every one of these they have uh the elements have this particular class so we have this uh we got this clue from over okay what we can do over here is that simply copy this name of the class and now go to the console tab now what we can do over is I want you guys to pay your atmost attention what I'm going to do okay type",
  "atmost attention what I'm going to do okay type dollar dollar then open up brackets then inside that what we are going to do I will simply add a DOT and then put the uh and put the class name inside it okay okay can you repeat this part like the one which you are doing yeah I will be but uh I would like to show you the result which we are going to get after this and then I'll will be explaining you uh the entire script which I'm writing so this is actually JavaScript which I'm writing okay uh",
  "is actually JavaScript which I'm writing okay uh doing this map which will be movie okay okay okay all right and uh let's see this so as you can see that we have got the names of all these movies in this particular list okay so we have the we have uh these kind of headings as well these headers are also included but we can you know we can slice the array and then we will be uh then we we will get the entire list of all these names okay so you can see that we we have got the names of all these",
  "see that we we have got the names of all these uh movies which are present in this list now what I actually did let's understand it to it in a much more uh compound okay first I will be breaking this code okay first let's understand what this particular chunk what this particular part of this quote is doing okay so this dollar dollar what does this dollar do it will actually this dollar will actually tell console that you have to fetch something from here from this element St okay so this",
  "from here from this element St okay so this dollar dollar will actually tell the console that oh okay okay my friend you have to fetch something from the elements tab right all right so using this dollar dollar and then when you will be opening this these two brackets then you can enter the particular class like I just told you that we will be uh that this class is common among all the names of the movies that we are going to fetch so uh it will what what what what this will do it will fetch",
  "what what what what this will do it will fetch all the classes all the it will fetch all the uh you know the code of all of uh where this particular class is present okay so what it will do is this will tell the console that go to the doc that go to elements tab then fetch all the elements which contain this particular class okay so this particular class so why I have added this dot over here because classes are actually represented with a DOT okay so this is a rule in uh CSS that classes",
  "DOT okay so this is a rule in uh CSS that classes should be prefixed with a DOT and ID should be prefixed with a hash okay so it's a DOT for the CL uh classes and it's a hash for the IDS okay and what it will do is it will fetch all those Elements which are present in the entire code which contain this class okay is that understood so just one question classes are uh just a type of formatting or something else no actually classes allow you to add CSS to your code okay so this particular H3 if I",
  "CSS to your code okay so this particular H3 if I just remove this class from over here let's see what will become of okay I just remove this uh okay and enter all right I guess okay so uh this class actually tells the code what kind of CSS you are you you you will be applying on this particular element okay so if I see over if I just look over here the here is the IPC title I guess this is the IPC title yeah here it is if I want I can simply change the color of this text let's change it to",
  "change the color of this text let's change it to Yellow okay so now all the uh all the uh names of the movies are being changed to Yellow okay so this is what actually class does class is like Yeah so basically it's like a shortcut to apply instead of doing individually on each heading you just make a shortcut named class and apply to everything you can say that exactly like uh we had classes in our schools or we we have classes in our uh colleges where we we where you know where a number of",
  "where we we where you know where a number of students study together so classes does actually that so all these elements which have this particular class will be applied this particular formatting okay also if I remember correctly uh there's something called jsx or something uh like uh basically this we are not generating the entire list we are not typing out the entire list we are just assigning the data to this and pre and and the HTML is being generated via a loop right yeah exactly that is",
  "generated via a loop right yeah exactly that is how the the class is allowing us to kind of apply The Styling across the board uh and we are not actually typing this entire thing this just the logic so uh what rrick actually told is that uh this this entire these all these 250 movies haven't been tied by a guy in his office uh one by one it's just using a for Loop over here but I won't be going uh much into much depth of this particular section because it involves the uses of JavaScript so I",
  "because it involves the uses of JavaScript so I would refrain from going ahead with JavaScript okay so uh is this class thing understood by everyone so how we can use classes and how you can change things with classes and how classes actually uh you know uh apply a certain kind of format on everything uh where it's present is that understood by everyone yeah please ask a question so if it is a class then we will use dot if there is one more thing which you telling id id id so we'll be using dot",
  "which you telling id id id so we'll be using dot uh hash exactly uh you can understand this in this way like uh uh in a department in an office we have a department okay we have an let's say an HR department so every guy has in their ID cards they have a specific identification number that's given to them at the time of their uh you know uh uh at the time of recruiting them and then there is their Department name okay so classes are something like the department name and IDs are something which",
  "the department name and IDs are something which is uniquely given to a specific person so the same way IDs are given to a specific T to a specific element and classes can be given to a multitude of elements okay so for instance if I want to apply a certain kind of formatting to this sang Redemption only I can use a ID over here okay I can use an ID and then it can then it will be only uh that kind of that formatting would be exclusively done for the sh Redemption okay I can just show you this",
  "the sh Redemption okay I can just show you this one uh so where is the the depths of it yeah where is the ID written uh actually there there is no ID WR over here because there is no use for the ID that's why uh but I can show you by generating an ID for this by actually creating an ID for this uh now don't ask me what I am doing over here I will just show you how the ID works okay uh let's go with the sh Shack all right done and now what I can do is I can create a new okay it's an element",
  "can do is I can create a new okay it's an element style okay I guess I can't edit the ID what I you can click over that plus icon yeah got it got it so here it is as you can see that here is an hash over here can you guys see this there is an hash over here and now this will allow me to do some specific coding some some specific formatting for this particular element all right uh let's say I want to you know bold embolden this particular because it's the you know OG of all the movies that has",
  "it's the you know OG of all the movies that has come right now so we can do something like uh font style and I guess it was B oh no it was font weight I'm sorry so you guys don't have to actually bother with what I'm doing over here it's just me trying to explain you guys something okay I guess font weight and what we can do so class is generic and ID is unique if I'm getting it in correctly uh yeah exactly IDs are unique as the name suggests they are unique for for a particular element and",
  "they are unique for for a particular element and classes can be generalized okay okay okay I guess it was font let's change the uh you know font family that would be much better font let's CH the font family and what it will give me okay you can see that the font family the the font the font you can see has been changed just for the sh Redemption not for any other movie you can see over here okay why because I'm using an ID that's why okay so I guess that answers the question and yeah please",
  "I guess that answers the question and yeah please ask a question uh Mr B uh yeah can we limit the selection of a JavaScript we wrote a program of JavaScript to filter out some kind of data can we limit to a specific chunk of the HTML data or is it going to work on everything that is written in The Element Section it would be working on everything okay what can please elaborate on your question like in a question that is going to appear in the later part of the week one they're going to ask us",
  "part of the week one they're going to ask us to find out the value that is in the div class and in a one more specific thing to it of a specific area and they're asking us to compute the values that are given to those diff class I believe I'm not sure exactly okay so if I'm going to start writing a JavaScript code for this like taking out the values from the the D class won't it work on the entire site and every div class that is in the site rather than just that specific area that I'm trying",
  "than just that specific area that I'm trying to get the in actually uh in so with regards to the whatever is present on your screen uh it gets built because of Dom structure so in so Dom structure is basically the tree structure that is there um so what it have it have the hierar structure so if there is some ID and then in that particular ID if there is some div so and then that div have some particular attribute so those things can uniquely be identified by uh some selector so on your web",
  "be identified by uh some selector so on your web page everything can be identified using some selector exactly you you want so how HTML and CSS are connected like uh like HTML you can say that HTML for a sorry JavaScript CSS how they are connected like uh uh we have to write JavaScript in order to extract anything from there yeah can please repeat your question uh basically is skeleton JavaScript are the muscles and skin is a CSS so JavaScript like I won't like that since since I'm a kind of",
  "like I won't like that since since I'm a kind of person so the analogy won't work with me so the thing is like JavaScript will be used for uh uh extracting anything which is there on uh CSS if I'm getting it correct uh no actually JavaScript will be used by to extract what's what's given in the HTML code using the CSS using the CSS okay okay okay yes okay so you will be using the CSS uh tags which are the uh classes or the IDS and then you can fetch out the HTML code from them all right so",
  "fetch out the HTML code from them all right so could you explain the later part of the line that you wrote to extract exactly I I'm just coming over there so is this particular section of the code understood by everyone just give me a yes yes yes yes yes since it's a class we are using dot exactly and dollar dollar is there like it will be used every time yeah dollar dollar with just communicate between the console and the element stuff you can understand it that way okay okay all right so uh",
  "understand it that way okay okay all right so uh let's understand what this particular code has given to us so it has given us the entire list of the element of the it has given us the entire code of that of the elements which we have asked it for okay as you can see that this is the H3 uh I guess yeah this is the H3 of Shang Redemption okay so this is the code and uh you can see that we will find yeah here is the short Redemption this is the actual code of the short Redemption that it has",
  "actual code of the short Redemption that it has given to us now obviously we won't be requiring the entire code I just need the text out of them all right so for that what I will do is we can run a map over this particular chunk of code okay so over this and so this is like a python uh list okay this is like a python list and and now I'll be running a for loop on this entire list to extract all the names okay how we can do is we can use a map function so map will just basically it will run a uh",
  "so map will just basically it will run a uh a for loop on the entire uh array and then it will give it will just uh output the entire the names of uh the movies which are present in these particular chunks of code okay so we can do anything anything with the map let's say uh uh okay let's go ahead with this particular junk okay so in the in this map function what I will be doing is I will write movie and then for from this movie I will be extracting the inner text okay so what I did over here",
  "the inner text okay so what I did over here is that I gave like in four loops and you guys must you guys have been through the python course so you must know that for when we are running a for Loop it will ask like it's always like for I in R for I in this particular list right so it's always like this for I in and then the uh list you have right so what this particular movie name is doing is or this particular movie uh uh you can say variable is doing is it's acting like this I okay it's",
  "is doing is it's acting like this I okay it's acting like this I and then we are performing something over this I okay we can simply uh let's for the sake of Simplicity let's remove this movie and I will use the I because I is something that's much more familiar with the python Community okay so yeah as you can see we get the same results okay so this movie was just a variable name which I gave okay so this is just a variable name we will tell that I'm look look map function I'm going to use",
  "that I'm look look map function I'm going to use this particular variable and I'll be performing some things on this particular variable okay so then uh if when we use this I variable using an arrow function so this is an arrow function I won't be going into the depths of JavaScript because uh it would again confuse you guys so for Simplicity this arrow is B basically you know uh you can uh understand it like this uh this uh it's going through a function in this Arrow okay so so this I is going",
  "function in this Arrow okay so so this I is going to uh going towards this particular code okay so you can understand it that way uh okay and what we are going to do over here is that we will be extracting the inner text attribute of this particular variable okay so what does this inner text do this inner text is just an attri rute which will give you the entire text that's present in that chunk of code okay so it's it's just going to give you the entire text that's present in the code okay",
  "the entire text that's present in the code okay there is another attribute just like in our text which is inner HTML okay so as the name suggest can anyone just tell me what this inner HTML will give just a 11 Guess OD which is there exactly it will give you the entire code okay actually there is nothing present in this uh in this particular tab uh which can be constituted to a code that's why it's giving you the text uh okay we can do one thing to differentiate between uh inner text and inner",
  "to differentiate between uh inner text and inner HTML we can do something like this so I'm just putting bold tags uh you need not bother with what I'm doing okay that's done okay so now if I try running inner text so uh I want you guys to remember that I did something to the short Redemption okay so you guys have to remember that I did something to the short Redemption and then we will be checking what I actually did all right so you can see that using inner text it's just giving me okay it's",
  "using inner text it's just giving me okay it's giving me short Redemption but when I use inner HTML what is it giving me right now can you guys see this it's giving it's giving you the Bold codes you put in exactly it's G it will be giving me the entire code that's present in that particular element okay because I used uh B tag it's actually bold tag H it will just embolden the particular text and you can see that it's giving me that bold tags as well but using inner HTML it will just give you",
  "well but using inner HTML it will just give you the text which is present in that entire code okay so this is how these attributes work and uh I believe that you will be using this in our text much often than uh in an HTML all right because you will be required to extract the data not the code most of the times in this course so uh this is how you can uh extract the all the names of the movies and any questions for this so just like inner text are there any other commands or the attributes",
  "are there any other commands or the attributes which are absolutely there are there are some other commands you can see over here yeah if I just like like there might be many but like those what are like like closely knitted back to our course so so that we get like two or three which which is being often used I guess there is a text attribute but obviously text is not being showed over here so remember this whenever text is not working if you're trying to use text whenever it is not working",
  "trying to use text whenever it is not working always use inner text okay inner text will absolutely work each and every time but whenever it is not uh but uh you know sometimes people use text as well so sometimes when text works it's all good but if text doesn't work this text attribute doesn't work simply use inner text so inner text will work for each and every time so you can just skip over this text and just always just remember the inner text part all right uh I guess also one thing like",
  "part all right uh I guess also one thing like uh should it so uh so the inner text should be written in the way it is written or like T can be smaller or like that or the way it is written okay way something that you can check is whenever like for instance you after the session you are trying to you know uh go to YouTube and trying to fetch out all the names of the songs that you like let's say and you have a playlist and you trying to extract all the names of the songs that you like and then",
  "all the names of the songs that you like and then you forgot oh what did sarange said was it inner HTML and the HTML only the H was capital and T and ml were cursive or just like you asked the T can be uh caps lock or that he can be cursive or not for this whenever you forget simply go over here okay in this array you will get the entire list of attributes you can access okay so for instance this is the this is the element this the particular element of the Shing Redemption and over here you",
  "element of the Shing Redemption and over here you can see all the uh what all the attributes that you can access okay you can see that we have an attribute uh like there are multiple uh attributes you can access and here is the in inner HTML and here is the ER text okay so whenever you forget okay what what this s said oh I forgot simply open this check over here what what it was okay it was inner HTML VOA I will use this okay and uh here is inner text you can see other types of uh attributes",
  "text you can see other types of uh attributes as well here is the name space URI you can you can just explore these these uh what what we can just explore all these types of attributes and it will be a really good exercise for all you guys so here we have the attributes for uh you know JavaScript events as well you if you don't want you can not bother with all these here we have the text content okay so it was actually text content all right so I guess there is nothing like text it is text",
  "so I guess there is nothing like text it is text content let me just use this one as well so there is nothing like text it is text content now I guess they have changed some things because earlier I I uh when I used it it was text it was just simple text but now it's text content all right so whenever text content doesn't work always use inner text all right so this is my is something you can remember all right so uh this is how CSS selectors work also one more thing you guys asked me about the",
  "also one more thing you guys asked me about the ID one let's do one thing let's fetch the Shang the Shan Shack ID which we just created okay if I WR SH shank uh all right so you can use IDs in this way just prefix it with a hash and then put in the ID name okay and here you can see because there is only one element which contains the uh the ID sh that's why that's why it's showing us this also remember that uh whenever you are uh that ID should be exclusive to a particular element if you try to",
  "exclusive to a particular element if you try to give it to another element uh it will create some anomalies and that would be a whole kind of mess so don't don't do that and if you want to assign multiple if you want to assign something to multiple elements just simply use classes all right so this was how you can use uh CSS classes uh all right so any questions for you guys uh you guys have um while showing this uh inner text thing you did some kind of command that uh like made the entire list",
  "kind of command that uh like made the entire list of movies extremely knit like they came in line by line rather than this paragraph actually actually that's the that's the way of console presenting because uh it should technically it should just give you all the the entire list of the of these uh elements but what it does is it says don't worry I'm here for you and uh it will just simply you know pack 100 items of all these uh this it will just pack back one of 100 items it will just segregate",
  "pack back one of 100 items it will just segregate the entire array into 100 100 100 so that you can you have the ease of uh you know understanding what's going on that's why otherwise it's an entire array over here okay it's an entire array and uh there is no segregation kind of thing like this is just for the viewers uh benefit all right also one more thing now you may think that okay Sange told us this and now how can I cop like I want to copy this entire list to somewhere okay how we can do",
  "this entire list to somewhere okay how we can do that so for that there is something like uh here is the uh entire in the bottom you can see that here is the entire uh list it's showing me but obviously I won't be able to copy it entirely like if I just click over here it will uh give me these segregated list parts and then should I just copy it this way absolutely not JavaScript has it done for you okay how simple just remember this enclose this entire piece of code into a copy function okay",
  "entire piece of code into a copy function okay can you see this there's a copy function enclose this entire piece of code in this copy function just press enter what it will do is can anyone guess it copy it to your clipboard so that you can paste it somewhere else it has copied to our clipboard if I uh if I just create a new file let's say I want a text document I will say movies. txt okay I'll open it and if I press V voila we have the entire list of all those movies and then over here you",
  "list of all those movies and then over here you can just simply remove those particular pieces which you don't want like for instance uh can anyone tell me that why uh we have got these uated more explore along with these movies can anyone just tell me because they are going under the same class that these movie names were exactly exactly you got it so they actually have the same classes for uh the movie names and then this uh these uh certain uh I guess these are links to some other pages of",
  "uh I guess these are links to some other pages of this uh particular website and these are actually they have use the the same classes over here so technically it's not a good idea to use the same class for uh completely different section of things like these are movies and these are links like man what are you doing you should just use different classes over here but anyway they have used this and uh like if you got a question yeah they using the same classes here because if you tap on the",
  "the same classes here because if you tap on the movie they open into the description of the movie so the movie names are acting as a link here I think uh where it is just a second over here yeah there are actually links but uh again uh you know if I will be creating this website I will just segregate out the I will use different classes for these uh certain headings and for these certain things because you know you should be considering that someone will be using will be like fetching data out",
  "will be using will be like fetching data out of your website you should be considerate of that so I guess that's something that I IMDb website people can you know integrate in future but that's up to them obviously we can't tell them just angry at people scraping their website as default absolutely because you know IMDb is something that's really generalized and people always scrape something like if I want to see okay I have I want to see a lot of movies I am uh let's say I'm traveling from",
  "of movies I am uh let's say I'm traveling from Delhi to Chennai on a train on a you know shatabdi or a rajani Express and I have a lot of time why not I should watch some kind of movies I'll just uh scrape the entire list of these movies and just watch it one by one one by so people use it for several kinds of uh use cases so they should be considerate of this but obviously we can't uh lecture them on that okay so uh all right so uh this actually concludes the part of uh this uh one exercise",
  "concludes the part of uh this uh one exercise which I can give you guys is that uh while you are here that this is the as you can see that this is our meeting I will give you the task of extracting the names of all those people who are present over here okay I want you guys to extract the all the uh the names of all those people who are present over there using inspect menu and the console that I have console and elements tab so uh it would be a really fun exercise for you guys and uh yeah so",
  "a really fun exercise for you guys and uh yeah so try it out uh because obviously this is a website as well this is a web page kind of and you can perform you can open up an inspect menu like for instance right here you can open an inspect menu and you can look into the like look into the element which which has the name of the particular person and then you can extract the all the names okay so here's a fun exercise for you guys let's try it out okay so that concludes the so this developer",
  "out okay so that concludes the so this developer tool so this developer tool only works on Chrome or like I guess it works on edge as well but I don't use Edge no like on on so for example I'm I'm I'm logged in from Safari so so how to like get to that try right clicking anywhere on the web page and search for an inspect because I guess Safari and Moosa everyone must have an inspect menu over here reload page save page as print page at the very bottom you must see an inspect menu in the",
  "very bottom you must see an inspect menu in the meantime I want you guys to perform that activity which I just told you would be a fun one um Sans yeah I like I did figure out the lists sorry the classes that are related to the names on the list but the classes are something like uh in bracket span class is equal to Z wgib something is this a class or is this something else if if it's a class it should be uh you know marked with a class uh can you mark can you just tell me okay this this span",
  "you mark can you just tell me okay this this span is actually the element this as you can see over here the class is mentioned with an equals to sign and then this is the class this is the particular class okay are you able to see this this is the particular class we are looking for can you I'm U I'm not able to find like which is the class so in this this this entire one this entire uh it's an element over here but when you are searching for a class it's just given right over here like class",
  "class it's just given right over here like class equals to and this is the class this is the class certain class okay so classes are always given with class equals to and then the class okay this is a certain class uh don't include the code over here because some people are tended to you know include the quotes obviously this these quotes are not the part of the class name this is the class okay I guess it might be different for you guys because I think they are uh uniquely generated for each",
  "I think they are uh uniquely generated for each person I don't know about that just try it out and uh if anyone gets it kindly tell me is there no method to find the class like control+ f like we straight away jump instead of reading the entire element code we straight away jump to that line well entire element you know uh I just told you like uh I want to see the class of this like this is my name over here I want to see the class where this particular my name is written over okay what I will",
  "my name is written over okay what I will do is simply right click over it drag down and inspect it will bring you over here it will just you know uh directly bring you to the certain element that you have to fetch it out okay so here is the element and here is the class simple done or you can just select something and then press uh Control Plus shift plus C that also opens it okay you guys can uh do this actually uh the idea for this particular exercise came when I thought that people uh don't",
  "exercise came when I thought that people uh don't actually they just join the meeting but they aren't going to whenever a TA or a teacher asks them some kind of question they are not tended to respond that way so I thought that why not just fetch out all the names of the people who are present in the meeting then run a then just copy them out run a python script where they uh simply randomize the the entire list and give you a random person so for instance if I run that and I got rck let's say",
  "instance if I run that and I got rck let's say R I got and then I will ask okay ritwick do you understand this and then perhaps rck will open his m and then say yeah sir I got it I got it okay then answer this particular question so uh this can be uh done so like when I was in my when I was in my studies we did uh like we I didn't responded to teachers and teachers were like okay please answer please someone answer so this can be you know solved with this particular thing just simply randomize",
  "with this particular thing just simply randomize the names of the person and it will just give you out a random person to ask a question from so that's how that's the origin of this particular exercise so yeah can we can we go back to the syntax that we typed it is like class name map uh okay in the console it has been washed out but yeah that is really um nice of you to give us a practical hands on while in the session because most probably when I go back I will just leave and I won't come",
  "when I go back I will just leave and I won't come back to this again yeah so uh if you uh want to like I won't write that particular uh line of code again but you can use chat GPT for this like it just tell him that I want this and I want to map I want to get all the names out of like this you can just tell that and it will give you so uh I guess it's time uh we can do something like uh if anyone of you gets it just simply uh you know tag me on a discourse post and tell me that okay I have done",
  "discourse post and tell me that okay I have done this particular exercise like you told us and perhaps if but when this meeting ends we will not get this we have to start a different meeting to do this uh yeah that's uh that's the downside but you can just give me the code okay so I did this and this was the class and then I just ran this particular line of code and it gave me the entire uh you know the entire the list of all those names you can do something like that or you can like create a",
  "do something like that or you can like create a new meeting of your own and uh add yourself to the meeting then extract the names out that's a problem okay so uh JJ uh anyone have any questions any questions any last questions because I guess ja it's time should we wind up the meeting uh yes sh rest of the questions we'll discuss it in the next session you can wind up the meeting and uh this introduction about CSS selectors and Dev tools was very well explained so thanks for that thank you okay",
  "well explained so thanks for that thank you okay so uh in in in the meanwhile what what things uh or uh you need us to go through before coming for the next meeting given what we have studied today well I would recommend you guys to you know uh look into the elements and the console tabs also if you are you know curious you can look into the networks tab as well so just get around it just have some fun you know open something and uh change some elements uh",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/hG5WqtbpfkI =====",
  "you going to start from question number seven like the count W day's question uh yes yes we'll be starting from question number seven and so so any one from you guys would like to explain about how to solve question number seven I can save the method I used yeah sure you simply open an Excel file you take two cells you put in the dates into the both cells and then you simply put in the command that helps you find out the differences between those two dates me how many days passed between these",
  "two dates me how many days passed between these two days and you simply divide it by seven it uh actually just gives you the amount of weeks which has passed and you can say each week there is one wedness day so that many wedness days have also passed H all right so in my case what is happening here so for example this particular date is starting from Tuesday okay so instead of starting from Tuesday what I can do I can uh start from the next day instead of starting from this particular date I",
  "instead of starting from this particular date I will start from the next date and then what I will have I will have uh 29 November 19 so then I will have 30 November 1983 and from there I will count how many days are there and then I will do a division by seven and that would get me the number of weeks so if this day starts from some other day for example if it starts from Monday or Tuesday then uh just dividing it by seven might give you correct answer or it might not give you correct answer",
  "answer or it might not give you correct answer so we we'll have to update our logic based on that otherwise your approach is very good uh because there was another approach as well so the other approach was you start from the uh nearest wedness day nearest means whatever is after 29th no 1983 and then you keep uh running in a while loop you in a while loop you each time you you jump over seven days and that way you keep approaching to this particular date which is not efficient way so whatever",
  "date which is not efficient way so whatever you have told is very efficient way you can uh create two dates in Excel and then you can uh use the formula that allows you to create uh com uh calculate the difference between those two dates all right so that's all about this question and it can also be solved using python modules such as there is one date module in Python and so this is something what you can use so it um uh this is for Delta this creates a Delta of all right so what I'm saying is",
  "a Delta of all right so what I'm saying is you can create to dates using date module of python and then also you can calculate the difference between those two dates and that way also you can solve this question and you can even do it in browser console itself using JavaScript date functions so these are different ways to do it I will now move to question number eight and question number eight requires you to extract CSV from a particular zip file so this is a ZIP file if I download it it will",
  "so this is a ZIP file if I download it it will open it open up as in zip file and then it only have one uh CSV file so basically it just requires us to extract that file we can use File Explorer or you can even use when rare any or we can even use command line tools so I will just skip this question because I think everyone knows about how to extract zip files okay so here we have Jason now what is a Jason so if you want to store some uh data let us say you want to store names of students and",
  "us say you want to store names of students and along with the age uh or it might be the name of an employee and then you want to store their age so the way to do it is [Music] you is there any background noise from my side there is slide but it's there is slide background nice all right so if I create a Javascript file and now let us say I want to store details about all the students and um now this is a Json notation then what I can do Json is basically similar to key and value payer so now I",
  "basically similar to key and value payer so now I can create uh instead of creating a JavaScript file I think I will inste do it in Python because it also have something similar to it [Music] so here I can create a a students list which have let us say if you have name and but to store each of those individual elements what I will have to do I will have to create these uh objects within it and then I will have name let us say name is uh let me take rck and I don't know what is his age let me",
  "take rck and I don't know what is his age let me put 20 so that he looks young and then we can take another name let let us say jivraj whose age is uh so I'm 20 years old so I will put 20 over here here and then we can take another name jatin who is in meet and let us say he is 15 years old okay now if I want to extract details about uh jettin so simply what I can do I can just use so jetin is on this third index so it is two and then if I want his names I will just use name and instead of his",
  "his names I will just use name and instead of his name if I want his age that's that's how I can get his age so what Jason is capable of you you you store things in a hierarchical fashion and then you can get those variables out of it and instead of having this name as a single uh name we can have uh names as first name and then let us say first name is rck and then let me put another keyword as last name and last name is three so now can can anyone tell how can I access uh first name of rck",
  "anyone tell how can I access uh first name of rck you put in another set of square bracket under the name and then you put in the first name the code is showing here I guess uh yes so what I have to do I have to first go to the first index that will get me this particular object once I get this I want name which stores uh this information and within this I just want his first name so this is how I can get his first name all right so now I will show you something that that makes use of this Json",
  "you something that that makes use of this Json structure so if I just open discourse. and then if I go to Network Tab and let me just go to this users page now here we can see this data have loaded over here but how this data gets load so uh yesterday uh shans was talking about it sends it fetches some data from some backend server so this is where it have it have sent a request to a backend server and what it have it have got Us Weekly data that's that is because we have selected week over",
  "that's that is because we have selected week over here if I change it to year then it will get us some it will send some other request and then it will get yearly data I think this is the one that have yearly data now we can even change these groups and that way we can uh rest we can put multiple filters over here in url coded parameters and then it's been ordered with the the number of likes that someone have received so what uh so when we have sent this request and then it have got this data",
  "sent this request and then it have got this data that gets populated in the front end so how this data have come to um us so I mean how back end have G response so from back end this is what we have received so this is basically a Json uh this Jason have a key directory items and the directory items have got this ID uh this ID refers to I think it is my username so I think it is my user id itself even we can uh so I think this ID is associated with me I I think so maybe it it won't show up here",
  "me I I think so maybe it it won't show up here but that that is my ID and then it tells how many solutions I have given and then this is some gamification scod that gets calculated based on number of likes and those things and then here we have some other information how many days I have visited so after joining I think these many days I have visited and then uh so this directory items is a list within this particular list this is zero Index this zero index have some key user and then it have",
  "zero index have some key user and then it have got my name over here so if I want to get my name from this Json what I can do I can go to uh I what I will do let us say this variable is stored in uh some response variable then what I will do I will do response of um directory items and then within directory items I will go to user and then within user I will go to name that way I can get the username and right over here we have some other ID and then this is for Anand a year and this is his ID",
  "then this is for Anand a year and this is his ID and then all those information about him so when we are populating this particular website using some Dom manipulation if you have structured data that is stored in Json and if backend uh sends data in Json format then we can very easily populate it here because we know how to access this particular Solutions variable we know how to access this particular likes received variable and then we even know how to access name and these things that's why",
  "how to access name and these things that's why we can uh put it in a formated way so this is very nicely structured format which have my name over here and then number of likes I have received over here and then number of likes that I have given all those details are very nicely structured over here so this is use of Chason so basically what happens whenever uh a back end uh sends some information to the front end mostly it sends it in the Json format so whenever you send the API call it will",
  "format so whenever you send the API call it will um it will send you data in some Json format so that it is structured and you can uh show it beautifully on your website right does anyone have any doubt on Jason part so just one thing uh if we also have to for some reason build webites on using JS javasript would that also help in DDS course uh actually I think your voice was breaking can you just repeat m 2 Mat 2 is a kind of prerequisite for this now so if we kind of revise all the JavaScript",
  "now so if we kind of revise all the JavaScript stuff we studed in m 2 is that going to kind of help in TDs is is there like a lot of inv uh see from JavaScript point of view I don't see much involvement other than other than the understanding of document selector which mostly gets used in TDS okay okay thank you and this this Json is basically some structured format okay so if no more doubts then I will move to next like while we are doing while we while we are doing uh like related to this",
  "we while we are doing uh like related to this course so we will be accessing uh particular websites information via python using this uh uh this one the JavaScript which you are telling uh you mean to say Jason like like I'm trying to like finding the bridge how things are related so uh all right like where we will be using this one because I completely don't have any idea about this sure so as I well I think I will go back to discourse and then I will try to access uh that particular data s",
  "I will try to access uh that particular data s not only access the data but also show the code which probably is a okay you would won't be able to show the code sorry no no no no I think I will show it so we have got the this and where is the is it this one no it should be which one yeah this is the one and then over here uh if I just copy all this St data so what discourse does whenever you you open this user page uh that's what I have done I have went here and I have opened usar Page by",
  "I have went here and I have opened usar Page by clicking on this particular button whenever you go to this particular page it loads 50 50 uh users so this particular Json have 50 different users so it have Kik instructor Karthik and then it have H these are all different people that are there so it it gets us 50 different users and as you scroll down if you hit end then it will send another request and then it will load more data so here it have sent another request so how it does it will",
  "have sent another request so how it does it will change one of these parameters and then it will load more data this is how it works I can show it um I think this is the first one so it have got this data to us so now uh B basically what you can do you can you you have got this uh request URL then here we have some request header and within this request header we have got this cook key and if we send this cookie along with the along so if you send this cookie and we try to hit this particular",
  "this cookie and we try to hit this particular URL using some API call all right then you will get in the response back you will get this particular data which is a very nicely structured format and now if you want to get username and those things then you can very easily get them and now what I will do I will just paste it over here and since this is a python file what I can do I can print and then uh I will have to first assign this to a variable so let me call it uh what do you want uh we can",
  "so let me call it uh what do you want uh we can call what we can call we can just call it a students okay and now what I will do I will get a students of uh directory items which is this particular key now within directory items I want to get the zero one that has my name over here so I will go to zeroth one and then I will go to user and I think within user we have name over there and this should print my name okay I will just save it somewhere downloads okay now I will just hit run button",
  "downloads okay now I will just hit run button select python interpreter and let me select the global one uh this is from line number 29 this true so this is because uh this is a Json it's not a dictionary so what I would have to do I think I will have to import Json Library over here import Jason and uh one Live question from my side so we we learned about this UV thing where we yes yes yes yes I will be using UV here okay okay okay instead of doing it in Windows I think I don't have U",
  "of doing it in Windows I think I don't have U installed over here got it got it yeah it's not here so I will move to the virtual machine I will just copy this whole code to my virtual machine uh this is another machine what I will do I think this machine have U installed yeah this machine have UV installed so I will go to TDs 2025 and then I another directory and what we can call it maybe we'll call it Jason and then we can go to Json directory and now I will open it in vs code how are you able",
  "now I will open it in vs code how are you able to identify that U is installed just by looking at the folders uh wait a second I will show that to you so the way to make sure that UV is installed you just type UV hyphen I version and then it gets you the version of the UV and if you don't get any version and if you get some error then you would have to install it okay okay sir okay so here what I have done I have imported Json and then um we have we are trying to get the name so now let me run",
  "we are trying to get the name so now let me run it using UV run and what is name of the file I think it's test. pi and true is not identified oh okay by the way why did it not give me error regarding Json when I tried to import Json on the very first line Why didn't it error because I haven't included anything in the metadata script or does anyone have any idea I'm clueless okay uh anyone else uh ideally what we should have done we should have included uh Json in the metadata script but it",
  "included uh Json in the metadata script but it doesn't uh it didn't give us any error while we were we did it so let me use this run. P haven't got any error scale Le maybe yeah now it gives me an error this is because these two modules GSN and request they are already installed on my uh local device in my Glo yeah they are installed globally yeah if they are not installed globally then it would give me an error in that case what I will do I will put some metadata script over here so let us put",
  "put some metadata script over here so let us put the metadata script here line metadata script and then this is the page that will have all those information and then I can just go here and I can paste it here and then I will say Jon but isn't Json already in your Global it's already in your local device yes but that doesn't make any difference I think still I will be able to run this particular okay because Jason was not found in the package registry I think Jason is I think it comes up with",
  "I think Jason is I think it comes up with the python pre-installed so this won't work let me just remove it and what I will do now I will use Json dot is it json. dump I think that would is it chasing loads or Chas in DS I think this is the one that I will have to use right do you mean true [Music] Jason uh this is because this in Json you use basically true as the the T in true should be kept so because we using python over here think that's the problem all right all right all right thanks",
  "the problem all right all right all right thanks sharan yeah that is the problem so what I will do I will replace all yeah null will also create issues so I think we'll have to to do something to replace null so right now what I will do I will replace everything that is kept a small t as capital T let me do that so just a second like we were reading the file and the basic example and can you come back like what are we trying to do here okay okay okay so first uh did you get the idea about how",
  "okay so first uh did you get the idea about how pend sends us response sir I was with you till the point you gave the examples and we draw out the data and naming after that I felt lost okay okay so what I was telling yesterday Shan was displaying some IMDb data and then he was also going through his website right now I'm using disc course which have these users listed over here along with the the number of likes they have received and number of likes they have given to others and then how many",
  "likes they have given to others and then how many replies and solutions these things so how this data gets loaded in the browser so this is from the network tab if I go to network tab here I can find information about all the uh request or you can call it external resources from where uh the external resources that this particular web page is using so one of the resource that it uses is it gets this data this name of my name and like received from somewhere okay so how it gets this data it",
  "from somewhere okay so how it gets this data it sends some API calls to back end so if I go click over here fetch xhr fetch comma xhr then I can find this directory _ items now if I look at the response that we have got so generally what happens we try to send a request to this particular URL and then I I will also send along with the request we used to send these cookies inside it and then uh in return it gets this data okay then this Json format which is very structured it have got directory",
  "which is very structured it have got directory items and this should be easy to extract like we did in the simple example yes yes yes this should be easy to extract and that's why populating the it here would be very easy yeah so what are we UV machine and like how did that come uh so what I was trying to do I was trying to import this Json module and then I was just putting some metadata script over here uh this one this is just to uh let me just put Jason here so if I'm importing any module",
  "put Jason here so if I'm importing any module and then if I put all those dependencies in the metadata script and then if I use UV to run this particular file then I don't have to create those external uh what do you call it uh you haven't saved it yet okay okay so this gets me this error because Json is already a pre-installed module I think that's why we get this particular error okay if there is some other module then if I import it I don't have to create uh those you can import esal because",
  "to create uh those you can import esal because it's not installed in your local device Yes actually what we trying to do over here is that uh uh we are trying to import Json and then do some stuff with Json so importing Escalon won't be of much help over here so we can do one thing we can just you can just uh yeah just remove all that and now we can try running the script yes sh that's what I will do so I will also since this null will also create an issue I will just replace it with the nulls",
  "an issue I will just replace it with the nulls with codes and now we are ready to run the script okay uh string indices must be integer not uh Str Str okay why does that error come you could also use JavaScript like we could do uh Ric did you say something like JavaScript would be very easy for this no what I'm trying to do we have copied that Json from there and now I'm just trying to look for my name okay within this Jason you can even do it in JavaScript so now if I just JavaScript would be",
  "JavaScript so now if I just JavaScript would be like needs to show okay so I have got my name over here so this is what I was trying to show you have got uh you can very easily get these names and these things because it have this hierarchy it have this particular keyword which is a array and then within this array you have got individ individual elements and then in these elements you can extract them as well now what you can do if you want to get username of each of them so for example uh",
  "to get username of each of them so for example uh this guy have an ID of 7771 and then it username is this one and then it's sorry basically it us name is did you load it did you load the Jon like you imported Json right no no no no this Json I have just copied it from here the the library Jason you imported it right no I didn't import it because you have to load it as a Jon as well right whatever object you are having if if you were accessing it accessing it in that well actually uh there is",
  "it accessing it in that well actually uh there is no need for the Json package over here because uh we have copied the entire Json object from that particular from that particular inspect menu and then over here it's acting as a dictionary so the entire so like we are not dealing with the Json over here we are actually dealing with a dictionary so this is how you can actually just simply copy the Json files the Json object and paste it in your python script then you can use it as a dictionary",
  "python script then you can use it as a dictionary yes yes yes did not notice that thank you yeah yeah J so uh I guess we were looking at how we can like run a for Loop over here and access all the names uh yes you correct challenge so what I will do I will create a for Loop and how I will create a for loop I I would have to create a for Loop for this directory items that is because this is a array okay so what I will do I will say for Element e m n in the students of directory items and then uh",
  "n in the students of directory items and then uh uh now uh now this element will have a key user that will have some information and then we can just go to name and instead of printing them we can store them somewhere so let me create a list and then we can append them and at the end we can just print it [Music] okay so we have got all these names so what I was trying to say you can run over four Loop and then you can populate all this data to the front end and it comes very nice and why you",
  "the front end and it comes very nice and why you are able to access it because it have a very beautiful for format structure you can see so Json have very beautiful structure and using that you can extract you can access things the names and different things and so this wasn't possible without the UV package like normally you can't load this no UI got nothing to do with uh reading this JS and even I can run it using python see it works uh so the only usage of UV yes yes yes sh uh yeah so uh",
  "the only usage of UV yes yes yes sh uh yeah so uh what I was thinking that uh now that we have shown them how you can actually access uh the Json object and extract data from that how about we show them how you can actually load the Json object using uh given URL in your python script so that would be using the request send a request yeah absolutely sure okay I will do that all right or would you like me to do that to take that part uh all right you can do that sure all right all right I will",
  "you can do that sure all right all right I will stop sharing all right all right guys is my screen visible yes it is visible all right yes sir let me s first let me create a new folder and then we can start working [Music] okay I'll be creating an juper notebook or python file all right so now that we have learned that how you can actually access the Json object what remains is that we have to see how you can actually extract that Json object us from a URL okay so for that purpose uh let's look",
  "from a URL okay so for that purpose uh let's look at some things okay so uh okay let's go to uh Library let's say nominating okay I'll be using my own website over here okay because I'm much more aware about the apis and everything about my website more than any other one okay so uh when you go to the networks tab so whenever you're trying to access the Json object the networks tab is your friend over here okay and uh uh you will be going you will find each and every everything that you will",
  "will find each and every everything that you will find those just objects and veryable is the screen visible someone is saying is the screen visible all right all right so whenever you are going to work with Json objects and whenever you are actually uh going to extract those those Chon objects the first and uh the first the first step that comes into the pipeline is you have to firstly get that URL which will actually give you the Json object okay so you won't be able to extract Json object of",
  "so you won't be able to extract Json object of any file that you of any website that you want without a URL okay so for that purpose uh speci websites basically have a thing called like they have a special uh what can we say a special URL for apis okay so this is the API uh calls for my website as you can see that here is an a slash and then API and now uh all the Json objects that would be would would be FG using this one okay so this is one API this is one URL for the API and there are even",
  "this is one URL for the API and there are even more if I go to let's say if I go to uh this learn okay go to this learn one you can see that more Json objects have been loaded more API calls have been run through and more just objects have been loed okay so if I just click over them and look at the response which jvj has already told you guys how to do that actually okay so just click over these uh uh kind of API calls okay and uh then click on the response menu and there you will find the",
  "on the response menu and there you will find the actual Json object which that this particular URL has fetched okay now one thing was simply copying this entire Json object and uh you know pasting that in your python script but another thing is actually extracting this entire object in your python script using the URL okay so how you can do that firstly let's look at the URL which is actually responsible for this so this is the URL let me copy this and uh before I will show you how you can do",
  "this and uh before I will show you how you can do this using python I want to introduce a new tool to you guys which would be really helpful for you to understand how all these Json objects are working okay so that's called Postman just a second sir yeah is copy pasting a problem here due to the large size or something else yeah due to the large size it might cause a problem because uh let's say here we had 50 like J When J was doing it I I guess there were 50 students over there but most of",
  "there were 50 students over there but most of the times whenever you are you know whenever you are solving questions for TDS or in your projects or in your Roe you will be getting data in Mass okay so there would be like 500 to 1,000 uh data values in a Json object and when you are trying to you know copy pasting when you will be trying to copy paste those objects into your python script it will create a whole kind of mess okay so why go through all that and another reason you won't be doing",
  "all that and another reason you won't be doing this is because uh you want to do things pro programmatically you want to automate a lot of things so you might need to send multiple request by changing some uh query parameters so for example here Q is equal to Delhi insteed of this you might have to get information about Delhi Chennai and then Kolkata different cities so how you would do this you won't be going to every page and copy paste what he will do you will send uh request instead",
  "what he will do you will send uh request instead absolutely all right so the thing what which D just said is that uh for ex for example I have this is actually nominating API so what this nominating nominating API does is it gives you the information about any uh about any location you want to search for Okay so over here in this uh Q parameter I have entered Delhi that's why it would give me the response for Delhi and for some reason it is not giving me that response to check that okay so uh",
  "giving me that response to check that okay so uh for instance you have been given a question that okay you have been given 50 cities and now you have to find the uh let's say latitudes and longitudes because nomina API will give you the latitudes and longitudes of that particular location you are searching for okay so you have been given an entire list of cities let's say not 50 there are 200 to 350 cities in India and then you have to let's say find out the uh latitudes and longitudes okay and",
  "find out the uh latitudes and longitudes okay and uh good luck if you are just going to copy paste everything then good luck with that it will just consume your entire day and perhaps your week and uh it won't be of much help so in case of uh what is the question you said we take an entire week that you have been given coordinates of 200 cities yeah you have been given 200 to 300 cities and then you have to find the latitudes and longitudes for those cities using nominating API okay so that",
  "those cities using nominating API okay so that would be a bizarre task for a single person uh doing manually doing just basic copy pasting so that would be a bizarre task what you can do is instead of doing Simple copy pasting I will just take the list of all those cities I will run a for Loop in which I will be again and again sending this request of nominating API just changing this parameter this T parameter okay here is here I've written t i can simply write Kolkata okay and it will give me",
  "can simply write Kolkata okay and it will give me the latitudes and longitudes for Kolkata and then I can search for that okay so I will be going through this nominating API uh I guess I have to figure out why it is not working after I actually show you how you can access the data uh which from my website okay so I guess there is some problem with there is some parameter problem no okay so what I will be doing is I will simply call copy and paste the URL from my website and then if I simply",
  "the URL from my website and then if I simply click on send over here it should give me the Json object okay so I have got the entire Jon object uh from that particular website without even opening up my Google page okay so let's say if I just close Google obviously I won't be able to close Google because my meeting is running over here so without even access we without even opening your browser you you will you can you know extract that just an object from a particular website okay so this is",
  "object from a particular website okay so this is how apis work so the only work of apis is to transport data from a particular server because every website is deployed over a server and it takes data it's like a carrier it will carry data from that server to the user who is accessing that particular website okay so this is how API actually work and uh so uh this is how it's working in my website's case as well because this learn course will give me all the data about the uh about the learn",
  "give me all the data about the uh about the learn about the courses which uh are there on the website and let's say I want to change this particular uh parameter let's say I want to go to my projects okay so for my projects I have to check okay this is the API call which is actually you know fetching all these uh let's say this is the fit mode this is the first one this is the fit in the fit of six models and here is the dis object of all the uh projects over here okay so this is the URL what",
  "projects over here okay so this is the URL what you have to do simple copy then paste over here and send and then it will give you the entire Json object okay so this is how uh Json actually works this is how apis actually work okay so now you have understood how Postman works so do you guys have some problem with Postman have anyone heard this name before it's an Indian company uh yeah so I was just wondering on which app are you in which application are you using this HTTP and https kind of",
  "are you using this HTTP and https kind of like there is some difference in HTTP and https HTTP and https the main difference is that HTTP is not secure and https is secure yeah yeah so so like long back I have used it okay you have used Postman like long back it's around four years or four years back okay okay so perhaps you can get a refresher of Postman so uh this Postman as the name suggest it's it posts your like it acts as a postman between uh you and the apis it just takes the a it just",
  "uh you and the apis it just takes the a it just sends the apis calls for you and extract the data and just give you the data I usually use Thunder client but like you can use Thunder client you can go to vs code uh there is an extension for VSS code which uh I guess I don't have thunder client yeah yeah here it is okay this is Postman uh there is actually an extension on uh vscode named Thunder Clin which one do you like better like is is Postman more you you can use anyone you know I generally",
  "more you you can use anyone you know I generally prefer Postman because I have made my mad 2 and mad one projects using Postman I got to know about thunder CL uh like few months back uh from my younger brother and you know that like when you when you get comfortable with something you are not to change the I did my projects using thunder so yeah so that's completely fine you can uh use Thunder CL instead of installing Postman you can simply use the power of vs code to do that for you simply you",
  "power of vs code to do that for you simply you open vs code go to extensions tab search for Thunder CL okay so you can simply install it and let me install it why not installing sir on the postman you are writing the for Loop uh thing also or no no absolutely not absolutely not so Postman is just used when you have to send one request okay so when I have to actually do that City part when I when I actually have to run the for Loop for that then I will be required to run it in my python screen",
  "I will be required to run it in my python screen okay so for Postman is generally for uh when you have to check okay what kind of data is it is giving or not so uh when I was making my when I was actually making my uh you know madman and mad to project so I was using Postman to check my API calls so this is how developers use Postman and you guys can also use Postman whenever you are trying to like uh access the entire data let's say because the reason is uh sometimes when you have data when",
  "reason is uh sometimes when you have data when you have Json objects which like range about you know 5,000 to 10,000 uh uh uh you know elements in that so over here I guess there are I guess there are at most 10 elements present in this Json object when you have actually 500 to 10 let me just open it over here would be much more easier for you to okay okay so we have uh seven objects of okay so there are seven objects in this particular array so we have we just have seven objects and uh that's",
  "we have we just have seven objects and uh that's why it's just running you know it's just running peacefully when you when you are going to get you know 5,000 to 10,000 or let's say 500 to 1,000 objects then problems will start to arise if you open it in Google it will just hang so I have fa that a lot of times I uh once I tried to open a we an API call and uh it opened up like exactly like this and it just you know my entire Google Chrome crashed because it has so much data it wasn't even able",
  "because it has so much data it wasn't even able to load it entirely uh there is actually a Pokemon uh API call which uh when I was in TDS uh few terms back uh we had to do something with the Pokemon API and the Pokemon API just like it's it's a simple API you can just simply search for a certain poke Pon in that using that API and it will just give you the entire details about the Pokemon you know each and everything when it got evolved who was the owner each and every you know detail about",
  "the owner each and every you know detail about that particular Pokemon but when I just tried to open it using this using like uh using the URL on Google the problem was it's instantly crashed okay pokem were the entire Google Chrome and then I have to restart the process how many Pokemons were there I don't know man there was I guess to learn the number of Pokemons the number of Pokemons like I I just searched for a certain Pokemon and they had information about conquered which C certain four",
  "information about conquered which C certain four it defeated each and everything like it was a large is object that's why it crashed okay so uh that's a for another time uh basically what happens if if there is a lot of data that needs to be loaded in those cases it sends multiple request using some different query parameters for example in case of discourse then you all know that there are more than 40 users but in every request we just get 40 users that is because uh there should not be much",
  "users that is because uh there should not be much load on front and side and also from the backand side so network if we send more data through the network then it requires more bits and bytes so what we try to send and that whole data might not be useful so for that we just send some portion of data and then whenever requested we will send more data so when we hit bottom of the page then it sends another request that is because we are requesting for more data so this is how data gets loaded in",
  "for more data so this is how data gets loaded in through the API calls it sends multiple request if it needed yeah absolutely uh this is another example yeah we can use this particular apis as well okay so back uh 15 days back I was looking for some job opportunities on unstop and what I realized was that you know uh going through each and every job and then opening it up then looking at okay what's the updation date and everything else it would you know I am a student of TDS why shouldn't I",
  "you know I am a student of TDS why shouldn't I automate this entire process okay so what I did was I created a python script which actually searched each and every you know it actually fetched this API uh this a this okay it's going to crash I should close it okay so you saw that it it was actually going to crash so what I did was I uh extracted the the data from uh that the API that they're using over here and then I just you know uh created a CSV file no Excel file out of that and then I just",
  "file no Excel file out of that and then I just use some filters to uh search out the best job opportunities which I can uh apply for on unstop okay so this was one of my Min projects which I did and uh uh I guess we should use this particular API at some point of time to show how you can actually access the data some useful data okay but uh let's leave this at this point of time and focus on this one because this is this is much more easier to understand okay all right so we have this certain",
  "understand okay all right so we have this certain URL and uh now you may be thinking that okay how how can I you know access it in Python so for that uh okay Thunder client has been installed so uh this is as I told you that this is the uh extension which allows you to send you know uh API requests so you can new request and you can actually send it send the API call you can simply click on send and here is the Json object okay so rather than installing Postman or any other type of uh any other",
  "Postman or any other type of uh any other uh Postman kind of program you can simply install this EXT tion of vs code so this is a really you know helpful extension for those people uh who don't want to install Postman okay so here you can get the objects all right let's close this one and let's get to python all right so for this we will be required to install few libraries and which is import are the request Library requests import okay I have to select the Cur uh Shan yeah uh you can run it",
  "to select the Cur uh Shan yeah uh you can run it using UV command line tool and stre I think that would be helpful will UV work in J script uh I never tried using Jupiter script uh you can create a ipnb file maybe yeah file but sorry F out okay we can create a file but let's check if it will work in II andd file as well what do you say I think you would have to create a file and then you execute that file so how would you run a cell using UV I don't know I think it's not possible okay okay",
  "I don't know I think it's not possible okay okay let's create this file the only uh reason I want to do this with IP NB is that you can actually you know without running the entire code you can actually see what actually is have with what each and every element can do and every line of code can do that's why I wish to use this uh let's do one thing uh instead of using UV we can uh you know I have some certain uh local environments which we can use uh can do this it is okay okay okay okay yeah",
  "use uh can do this it is okay okay okay okay yeah here it is and this hello it up so actually this uh why I have uh come to this particular folder is that I have a virtual EnV over here as you can see I'm hovering over that virtual EnV and it contains each and every module uh you will be required to use in TDS so when I was uh using my when I was actually doing my TDS course I created this uh uh folder and I created this virtual EnV okay so let's uh let me create a new file and uh let's say we",
  "uh let me create a new file and uh let's say we are going Json I NV okay let's do this let's kernel EnV all right now I will import the requests package and the Json package Json package all right okay it has been imported now let's get to it and uh let's see how you can actually use that certain URL to fetch the Json object okay for this uh just see what I'm actually doing over here and then I will be explaining each and every part of the okay let me create a new envir let uh the a new",
  "okay let me create a new envir let uh the a new variable so we it response uh requests. get here it is and response all right so what I did over here is that uh I actually sent a request using python how using the request package okay so this is the request package which I have used and this package actually has uh lot of you know functions to actually uh send your requests to a particular API endpoint for instance I have used get over here there are multiple other uh uh functions you can use",
  "are multiple other uh uh functions you can use there is post okay there is post uh there is put there is uh Delete as well so all these types all these functions are actually uh known as HTML verbs no HTML verbs or HTTP verbs it was HTTP verbs I guess yeah I guess it was HTTP uh yeah basically you can use request.get and those things are you talking about that yeah I was actually talking about that so these are uh the HTTP verbs you can use there is get there is post there is Port there is",
  "there is get there is post there is Port there is Elite you need not bother with put post and delete we just have to use this get command over okay so what this get will do uh do you remember that in Postman we had something like this here is the get can you guys see this we have this get option and we have all those uh HTM HTTP verbs which I just talked about all right so this get is actually going to do the same operation which Postman did for us okay so request.get and you have to open these",
  "us okay so request.get and you have to open these brackets and then you have to Simply put the API endpoint okay and then it will give you the Json object how how it will give you the Json object now this is the variable which actually has uh the entire thing and when you are going to print this variable you will see that it has given the response and it is 200 so what this what does this 200 mean it means that your that your uh request was was accepted it was successful it if it is like a 400",
  "accepted it was successful it if it is like a 400 kind of Digit then it has been rejected if it is 500 it has also been rejected so when it's between 200 to 300 then it's you know actually a good thing okay so your request has been actually accepted okay so response. Json I guess it was Jason okay and and it should give all right so response. Json so what is response it's just a variable over here as you can see it's just a variable which has uh which I have uh you know assigned this entire",
  "uh which I have uh you know assigned this entire function to and now I can perform the activities now the course the request has run now I can use this particular variable to do some kind of task for me okay so when you are going to use response. GS it will give you the entire Jon object okay now you can uh search for anything like this is a kind of python dictionary at this point I guess we have to use Json do uh Loops let me check this will work okay it has already been converted to a Pyon",
  "work okay it has already been converted to a Pyon dictionary I guess okay let me this name dictionary and then you can perform those operations which jivraj just told you okay you can use it as a p Pyon dictionary and you can fetch any kind of information from this is this part understood by everyone uh yes but uh uh didn't you go into a lot of details into the Json thing like for instance um basically Json is just similar to python dictionar it have uh the a nice format which allows you to",
  "it have uh the a nice format which allows you to extract each and every element so uh uh you guys like uh I I have explained it in a much more detail so is that a problem no no I was just asking I was not complaining I guess so s what I was asking is uh like we use get like we use get to uh fetch the required website and then from there we we save it in the dictionary variable and from there when we execute the dictionary we are able to get all these information exactly you can use it as a p",
  "these information exactly you can use it as a p python dictionary and then you can extract the data out of it all right so this is how you can actually run uh an API call you can use request.get and it will just run it will just fetch that Json object for you and using response. Json you will be able to uh use this entire JM object okay so this is how uh you can access that part also when the question which I gave you that the scenario which I just told you that you may be given uh you know 250",
  "told you that you may be given uh you know 250 to 350 cities and uh how will you be able to access that so uh I guess here is the nominative okay here it is so what you can do over here is that simply uh put this API call over here so these URLs are actually called the API end points okay so you can uh put this over here and then it will just fetch the entire Json object for you okay let me just uh see if it is working let's see okay it is not working I guess there is some problem with this",
  "working I guess there is some problem with this particular API endpoint I have to look into that but uh uh uh yeah so this is how you can actually send uh you can actually uh solve that particular scenario just simple uh what you can do is simply uh run a for Loop over for all those cities okay for I in let's say cities uh cities is a list which I have and uh what I can do is I can create it as a F string then I can place an i over here okay so if when you have a entire list of cities you can",
  "if when you have a entire list of cities you can simply run a for Loop over them and then you can get the response okay so this is how you can actually uh solve that particular Sy areio and this is how you run you send API calls using python so is there a problem or should we move ahead a small thing at a very later period of time so this vs code like uh I started uh I tried uh like creating a new page and start writing code whatever is required but uh I was not very much clear where to go and",
  "but uh I was not very much clear where to go and what to do in order to create all these IP ipy files uh you can like I guess you can create your simple yeah uh I think you can uh copy paste the same code and you can do it using UV command and you can show the power of UV you don't have to actually create uh python uh virtual environment and these things Yes actually we can do that as as well uh have to see that uh all right let's create a python file uh we can name it Json dop let's call it",
  "file uh we can name it Json dop let's call it this one okay so this python file is not going to be uh accessed by any okay I have to ENT yeah here it is it is should we import requests and import person then this part and we will be printing this dictionary all right uh I guess I have UV over here let's see do I have UV okay I don't have U there I have to install it uh it was pip installed UV I guess j h yes Shan you can use to install right U is installed let's see all right it's working it",
  "is installed let's see all right it's working it was UV run and it should be Json P let's see it hasn't given okay I haven't saved it so can you guys see this that UV resolved all those dependency problems I guess and then it has gave the entire uh juston object to us uh actually sh yeah uh I think these request and Jason these modules are installed globally that's why it's not giving you an error if they're not present then it would give you an error and in that case what you have to do you",
  "an error and in that case what you have to do you have to put those dependencies in the inline metad data script all right so do you have access to a virtual machine where you don't have installed requests I can create a virtual environment and then we can use UV I think we won't be able to use it maybe um no when I have a virtual environment okay okay you will activate it and then you yeah yeah that you can do yeah that's what I'm saying I can create a virtual environment then I will activate",
  "create a virtual environment then I will activate it and then perhaps you can use okay going back to this one okay let's create a virtual environment so if you guys are interested you can see how you can actually create a virtual environment this is a simple uh command line command and it has created a workplace yes okay I'll be creating a new file Jon file and copy the entire code all right there it is and close this one save it okay so here you can see that we have like because GSN is you",
  "you can see that we have like because GSN is you know uh installed pre-installed with python itself that's why it's not giving a problem over here but requests is giving a problem okay so what we can do is we will be using UV do we have UV over here okay first you have to activate this environment for that EnV those who are interested you can see how you can activate an environment okay it has been activated and now let's check do we have UV or not okay we don't have UV P install sh all right U",
  "okay we don't have UV P install sh all right U has been installed successfully got it now let's try running this guess it should work all right so we have to get that python script first that particular script element uh just search inline metadata script inline metadata yeah inline met script yes the first one I scroll a bit down no no not this one yes this one just yeah yeah correct correct yeah this is the one in comments no yes yes yes okay and done I will request okay here it has request",
  "and done I will request okay here it has request return okay so uh it's going to install request and now let's run it let's see okay I haven't saved it can you see guys that it's actually installing actually installed few packages it installed five packages in uh 82 milliseconds and then uh it actually printed this entire object okay so this is the power of UV you uh which you should use so while while writing the code we need to mention import request and import Json and then the U will",
  "request and import Json and then the U will automatically install all those things no no no so UI won't be able to install automatically you have to actually include this particular uh script this inline script and then it will recognize okay so it's asking me to install these dependencies beforehand and then it will it will actually go line by line it will see okay so this is written first so I have to install these dependencies then when it has already installed those dependencies it will",
  "has already installed those dependencies it will actually read these two lines okay how to write those particular script like uh is there a is there a like is like these are generic patter is this a generic pattern or like uh this is a generic pattern yeah this a generic pattern you have requ the the mode and then the dependencies are whatever we want to install you type it orate it what for example dependencies are requests and then Json also will be written over there and the inverted",
  "also will be written over there and the inverted actually Json is preinstalled whenever you install python it is actually pre-installed with that so that's why I had no actual need ofing J with that all right so this is how how you can do this you can simply search it uh in that I just simply copied it from over here okay simple copy it and then paste it even I didn't know how to write this particular script part just simple copy paste it okay what's the H okay so this is how you can uh send",
  "what's the H okay so this is how you can uh send request using python if there is a problem kindly uh raise your hand and ask a question or else we can move ahead all right so let's move ahead jaaj would you like to take over uh sure sh hope my screen is visible so this question we have done we have even done more than this question sh has actually sent the API calls and I have demonstrated by copy pasting those uh response that we got from by sending a API call to discourse so now we will move",
  "a API call to discourse so now we will move to next question all right so since we have already looked at what is Json and this particular file it have some text let me show you what it contains so it have got four over here and then it have got equal to and then it have got some value over here so what you would have to do instead of this you have to uh convert it to the Json object for example if this was the only content over here then how would you create Jon out of it you will put one uh",
  "you create Jon out of it you will put one uh curly brace here then you will put another curly res at the end and then you would do something like this and then instead of this you will have this guy so this is how you can convert it to Json instead of a simple file they have got multiple lines of code so you just have to replace it this equal to with uh the semi colon and then you have to just convert it to a proper jsn file so which you can do using um multi-line cursor in uh vs code so you",
  "using um multi-line cursor in uh vs code so you can just search over internet multi line cursor and here you can have a look at what is muline cursor so I would just skip this particular question okay uh regarding CSS selector this question this have been dealt by in a lot in depth by uh sharan's in yesterday's session so I think I can just um skip over it if anyone of you have doubt regarding uh CSS selector then you can ask me right now so there are few things mentioned over there like if",
  "there are few things mentioned over there like if you'll go down just scroll a bit down yeah yeah for example these small okay okay container header yes and like what are these combinators and D Diner is something Diner this one is so what are the those combinators the one about that okay we'll do that so if you go here well those combinations are actually uh kind of like a high level CSS selection methods so I didn't touch touched upon them last night because it would have like you know",
  "last night because it would have like you know confused you guys that's why I resorted to using simple selectors simple C selectors but these kinds of combinations can be used so this div AR P simply means that there is a div and then inside that div there is a P tag okay so there is a div tag and then inside that P there is a P tag so so it will just tell the uh it will just tell console that bro you have to access all those this which have a pag inside so this is another level of uh you know",
  "inside so this is another level of uh you know CSS selector methods you can use uh you can just you know just explore these types of other other combinations using TP or using documentation uh so uh yeah so basically right over here it applies this particular styling to each and every element then this is specifically gets applied to just a um B tag and then this gets applied to all the elements that have this particular class these are very basic things and then this is for ID and what this",
  "things and then this is for ID and what this does it selects all the this query selector what it does it will select all the U P tag which have my class and and with class it should have my ID as the ID okay and regarding the com on on a superv level uh what actually combinators do like uh in like they play part in creating uh web page or like uh okay what they do for example if I again I will again go to the same page here these informations are listed right if I go to the inspect Tab and then",
  "listed right if I go to the inspect Tab and then in particular if I go to the elements tag over here all these details can be seen if I just hover over the wait a second I will use some other browser which have better support for elements tags and those things so over here now if I go to user um where is user yeah this is the one now if I go over here and if I just click on inspect this gets me to this particular element so which have uh a span tag with the name class so what is this uh what we",
  "with the name class so what is this uh what we see in elements tab over here is we call it uh talk uh what we call it we just call it Dom module so over here we have head and then inside body we have different things so we have section over here which have ID as mean and then this have this particular class so all these elements that are here for example this name exist somewhere in the hierarchy and you can even see where it actually exists so if you just um keep going all the way here then it",
  "you just um keep going all the way here then it have HTML with this particular class then it goes to body tag with this particular class and those things and then it gets to section and within section it goes to div and then it goes to div and at the very end uh it gets to span with the particular class so this is the hierarchy of this particular dome which is there so basically whenever you try to load a a page what it what happens you get a file and in that file you don't have any data and",
  "file and in that file you don't have any data and then uh then some API call will it will make some API call and then you will get data in this structured format but now you will have to put this data into this HTML page so how you would do this you you will have some script in the sources tab over here one of them one of those script what it will be doing it will be populating this page so it will get this name and these things at the correct positions where it needs to be populated this is uh",
  "where it needs to be populated this is uh use of uh the basically this is Dom structure and those those this particular tag it can be identified using these classes and these these things so you can precisely identify these things in Dom using some class ID and some other attribute so if I go to this particular um graded assignment and if I go to inspect Tab and then over here if I go on this thing what this uh so if I just hover over this this is this question okay this question is",
  "this this is this question okay this question is encapsulated within this div tag so it just contains information about this particular question and how I can access this question I can use I I have div with this particular class and then I can even filter it based on the based on a attribute so if I just try to look look for this particular attribute so for example I can just go to console Tab and then I can do document do query selector and then if I put I think it's div and along with some",
  "if I put I think it's div and along with some uh I will have to look over here how we can select based on attributes this is attribute selector so over here you can look at this guy right so if I just use this same thing so what I have to do here I have to uh oh not this one this is the page and if I go to elements tab I have data questions uh here it it have HF instead of this H I will have data questions so I will use data questions data hyphen Q questions and this should be equal to",
  "hyphen Q questions and this should be equal to [Applause] this value then it will it will select that particular I fail to execute on document and is not a valid selector so maybe there is some mistake in the way I'm using selector let me just look over here um I have data hyph question is equal to this thing and then question questions you you put questions there this question without S no I think I have to remove this yeah okay thanks the with okay this have selected this particular question",
  "okay this have selected this particular question you can see over here so this is just by using the attribute selector so similar to attribute selector we have something know known as combinatorial selectors what they does so if I just go over this part of the documentation then we have uh so what it is trying to do it is trying to select a what it is trying to do it is trying to select UL so UL is just a list you can say and we are trying to select a list with this particular class and after",
  "a list with this particular class and after selecting that list you you are just trying to look for the uh direct children of direct children of this guy so if you go over here and then if you want to select this guy okay then uh so this is direct children of this div right you can see here so what I can do over here I can put div over here and div is not recognized that is because I have put it outside the string yes yes so this is selecting a particular element why because I am using query",
  "a particular element why because I am using query selector if I use Query selector all then it will select all those so there are three elements with uh which are direct children of this particular element so if I just go to the elements Tab and here we can see these are the three elements that have got selected now if you look over here this have some span and these things so we can even open this up and then we can go over here and we can see it have got some span tags and these things so all",
  "have got some span tags and these things so all this information you can have a look at inner HTML part of it and then so now you see what we have selected right now is this question and within this question we are trying to look for all the direct children but this didn't get selected right that is because it is part direct children of this guy it is not direct children of this particular guy right so it will select these three elements only it want select this guy okay so that's what this",
  "it want select this guy okay so that's what this particular combinator tries to select the direct children and now so this this this will select it div and uh then it will select the direct children of that particular div which is a span okay and then we have another so this is child combinator then we have column combinator so here we can look at the description of what this particular combinator do it matches only those elements matched by the second selector that belongs to column element",
  "second selector that belongs to column element matched by the first selector table say that belong to selected column so what it would do if you have a table then you can select a particular column and after with a particular class and then within that particular class you can do something okay so this way you can have multiple different kind of selectors and then if you go to descendant combinator over here uh it have it is trying to get a particular list with this particular class and within",
  "list with this particular class and within this list it is trying to uh list all of these things so if you look at this is list okay and Within These list so you can think of if it as a list and within this list you have these different items so you have this UL over here which denotes this list this whole list and within this whole list you have Li over here this denotes this Li tag and within this Li tag you have UL this is another sub list you can say and then within this list you have these",
  "can say and then within this list you have these two different elements what this particular tag is trying to do it is trying to get the uh list with this particular class and then uh within this list it will try to get all those La tags so for example if this UL had class of let us say it had this class my things for example and if it had this particular class then if you do if you just do uh if you put a space and then if you put a then what it would do it would select this Ali it will select",
  "would do it would select this Ali it will select this Ali this Ali this Al this Ali this Ali whereever it finds the LA tag it will select those La tags uh can you repeat this one this Ali thing which you are showing one again sure so here what we have we have that one is like anything which is tagged with li that will be so Li everything which is below Li will be extracted so Al for example from there to uh item one then sub item a sub Item B then item two these things will be selected I'm",
  "B then item two these things will be selected I'm correct Bic yeah basically what it would do it will get you this particular ul and within this UL you are looking for any tag it is not that you are looking for uh the direct children it can be any La tag for example it can fetch this La tag it can also fetch it will also fetch this La tag it will fetch this La tag it will fetch all these La tags if you put a space in between but whereas if you put a greater than symbol this one this one then",
  "put a greater than symbol this one this one then what would happen if I just go back over here then if you select this ul and then if you put a greater than symbol and then you select this lii tag then what will happen it will select this guy and this guy it won't select these individuals so that is difference between different selectors okay while doing this uh subject how to get catch hold of all these like there are so many do we need to remember like uh how to tackle this or there will be",
  "like uh how to tackle this or there will be some like there is a boundary within which the questions will be asked uh basically what you can do I mean even I don't remember all of them I just remember this guy because it is it gets used a lot this direct children and this guy also I remember a lot so there are few things which I remember and if I don't remember something I takes help from uh either the documentation or also as shans have told you can even use chat G we always encourage using",
  "you can even use chat G we always encourage using chat so if I ask him how can I select all the direct children's of a partic children only noce oh right okay so it says you can use this selector and then you can uh put the parent selector and then you can put the child selector over there ising sir yeah it gets used in web script okay you already know these things you are May 2020 for student actually I don't know these thing that's why I'm joining like webing I have to brush up again okay I",
  "like webing I have to brush up again okay I don't believe but okay I will accept all right guys so this is where you can get all the information from either you can look over the documentation where you can learn about different uh combinators and then different selectors here you can select using uh attributes and then classes and then uh IDs and then what is this type selector um I think let me read for this types the CSS selector why not name in and select all the inment of the given type",
  "in and select all the inment of the given type within a document I think it is for selecting anchor tag or some other div tag basically we'll be talking about more of CSS selector in some other session where we will be doing some some web scraping or something like that where will you be will be using CSS electors a lot so but this kind of feels a little overwhelming as someone uh I'm not even an engineer I'm not doing science I wanted to complete data science for my MBA but somehow everything",
  "data science for my MBA but somehow everything just feels overwhelming in this course the thing with TDs is that it challenges your logical brain okay so it challenges you to go in to solve problems which are you know which you haven't dealt with uh earlier okay so you we will be giving you questions so as you must have seen that many of these questions have not been even like many of these uh tools or we can say many of these techniques haven't been taught to you in the uh course in the",
  "been taught to you in the uh course in the particular week uh you haven't been taught these kind of uh some of these techniques and uh uh tools so what we are doing in TDs is that we have we are like we training you guys to actually challenge yourself to challenge your logical brain you have to see the question you have to read it and then you have if you require you can simply go to chat gbt you can just paste this you can just copy this entire piece of uh question and then just put it over to",
  "piece of uh question and then just put it over to just ask what should I do over this how should I approach this question so this is how we are challenging your logical aspect of the brain and this is how uh we want you guys to grow and uh that is there s but the thing is like having a little bit of background will will be more helping helping so so so you you you guys are doing right like the like you are heading in a right direction by giving a little bit of background because without the",
  "a little bit of background because without the background like it won't be challenging it will be floating in a space because there there will there are many things of which we don't know background and then searching for that in chat GPT completely like it's completely different yeah I understand because I agree to that even I'm trying a lot but I just have to there are a number of tools Technologies exactly and like without having a background just yeah agree with you guys but you know you",
  "just yeah agree with you guys but you know you have to develop that you have to apprach that Gap yourself so we are here to help you guys we are let's ask us questions if uh not in the live session you can just ask you can just tag us on a discourse post asking us about something and we can provide you course material not course material we can provide you some other types of uh material to study from from like YouTube videos like uh some other websites we can give you guys to to look from to",
  "websites we can give you guys to to look from to actually study from so you you know if there is a gap of background so you guys have to aage that because Tools in data science requires that kind of logical aspect and that kind of right I gone through the most of the courses which are required for TDS so I feel that the material which we have right it's more like a summary of whatever we studed yeah AB abolutely it's it's even more than a summary of the other subjects that are being taught in",
  "of the other subjects that are being taught in particular program it's much more than that I would say so this course will actually allow you guys it's just an liberating course so it will allow you guys to explore different aspects different tools different techniques and to look Beyond this particular degree so uh you know that will actually help you guys so let's say if you just use let's say has opened this uni code question okay let's say after solving this particular question you are",
  "after solving this particular question you are never going to see this you are not going to see this uh you are not going to use uni code anywhere in your life okay but in after some years or after some months a question arrives in front of you uh let's say you're trying to open a CSV file and it's not opening uh but and you and when you read that error it says that there is a uni code problem so then it will just strike you at that point of time okay so yeah I did something related to UNI code",
  "okay so yeah I did something related to UNI code okay so let me recall that what I did so you will just simply go to chat GP team and you will search what there was what is uni code and what you actually did okay so this is how so actually we are creating your background uh in this course so we are helping you to create your background your technical background which you might lack and this is why this course is going to help you guys this is very practical like I uh wasn't was discussing with",
  "practical like I uh wasn't was discussing with somebody that uh they were like giving example how they completed a web script uh via VIA web scraping they had to like make a table uh but they were making it manually before but then uh uh they asked a friend that uh is is there some way they can do it faster so what would have taken in 3 to five days they did it in like half an hour just because the other person knew how to web scrape or at least they knew that web scraping was possible they use",
  "they knew that web scraping was possible they use chat GPT and built up a code and made that table whichever like that they were supposed to make and they were able to do it like in half an hour which is like a huge Improvement so if you know how to ask the right questions that will help a lot uh so uh one one one more request from my side sir uh if I can have some of the study materials because like I'm managing job along with this one so it will be difficult for me to delve directly into on",
  "be difficult for me to delve directly into on my own so I'll need help from you guys not not a problem uh we can uh sort out all the materials we can give you guys we can sort out the uh YouTube videos or the websites which we believe that might be able to help you guys in this in these in this particular course and uh uh we will really we will post a this course post for that yes sh sure we can make a discourse post regarding all the materials that we can provide from our side also guys uh",
  "that we can provide from our side also guys uh there is a form there is a feedback form which has been floated to you in your uh you know seek window the the course window when you will be opening your uh uh uh itm dashboard you will see that particular form over there yeah is just showing you guys yeah we have to change this one 25 and so at the very bottom you will have this learning feedback uh this is a form created by us simply fill this form up uh it will ask you whatever kind of uh",
  "form up uh it will ask you whatever kind of uh challenges that you are facing uh in whichever field you are facing these types of problems and uh can you please scroll down and what are the actual reasons behind uh facing these kinds of problems and you can even give your other feedbacks so this form the responses from these forms will actually help us you know curate more uh uh curate much more uh you know uh uh it will allow us to introduce material it will allow us to you know plan our",
  "material it will allow us to you know plan our according it will allow us to uh plan what should we teach in our live sessions next it will be really helpful and we will request you guys to go ahead and just fill this feedback form uh carefully and uh write whichever whatever feedback you should write all right so uh one more thing is there like uh like we when I when I check when I'm currently checking my or TDS um TDS cach content like there is no uh like room directly for discussion which",
  "is no uh like room directly for discussion which directs directs it to uh the discussion forum so yeah can we have a help on that one uh so you want a discussion disc disc discourse discourse link isn't isn't available over there all right if you go over here and here you can find discord's link I believe leave yeah this is the one okay okay uh jash what do you say should we give a link in the portal as well sir please share this link sir this we can make a request to them I mean yeah we can",
  "we can make a request to them I mean yeah we can tell to the operations team to put a link over here share this like I'm not I have not joined this uh okay so you are asking for the discourse link right no no get it that one did you share in the okay so actually all the course content has been released over here I I saw that few students were struggling they were asking that uh is there no course content for TDS they were asking these types of questions and yes obviously there is content for",
  "questions and yes obviously there is content for TDS and it has been released over here so those guys should know really they should study yeah even we are fastest to release till week three we have released so I think we are ahead of other courses so you like all this information has been released in the seek portal so if someone is not able to understand that you have to go to this particular link and then study actually we have uh I guess we have released the entire uh yeah all these till",
  "have released the entire uh yeah all these till here we have released week yeah go ahead and look at all these materials uh jrj actually we have released the content for other weeks as well uh we Haven released assignments yet but we have released the content yes yes we have some content for week four as well but some of them is pending it's not entirely available so if you guys want you can simply go to this particular link and you can study uh content in advance as well and uh yeah it would",
  "content in advance as well and uh yeah it would help you guys okay one question like um whatever You released in the portal and whatever you raise in this particular tab that is like TDS dos. net yeah yeah yeah is it like same thing yes yes entirely same I will just show you so these are the three different modules that have been released and if you go to a particular graded assignment what you will get you will get the URL to attempt this uh assignment the same you can get it from uh the web",
  "the same you can get it from uh the web page that I was showing you okay so TDs is open for all theum this term even you would have seen an's post on it okay okay that's fine that's why I think so like there are lot of you know upgrade in TDS course really helpful I I did my TDS course two times back and there has been a massive upgrade in same here I okay and these updates are really actually for students okay thank you uh all right guys then now I will move to this unic code question",
  "then now I will move to this unic code question basically here there is nothing much to do uh all you do is you open a particular file and this is this is just opening a file in a regular way and this is uh you use Panda to open a particular file with some encoding and let us say you don't know what is encoding for this particular file then what you do you try to detect encoding so you import this particular module and then you you pass this particular data. CSV over here in the readable mode",
  "data. CSV over here in the readable mode and then you just try to detect the encoding and if you do this it will get you the encoding of that particular file I can do it right now I think um I can just close and then maybe right over here Cod star and we can create it. txt file and we can have some text over here and now I just use T me.txt and let me run this file UV run test. pi and it says I need to install this particular module so I will just use inline metadata script and I will just",
  "just use inline metadata script and I will just remove this thing from here and then also guys I have uh send this particular the the script the inline script which is shivaraj is using I sent the template of that particular code in the chat menu what happen with this code sorry Del can you repeat your question I mean what happened with this code is it installing like yeah so this UV module what it tries to do uh you have this you are just trying to import this F uh this module and let us say",
  "to import this F uh this module and let us say this module is not present on your system if I just remove it and now if I run this file it will say this particular module is not available on your system and now if I include this metadata script over here and now if I try to execute this file then it installs all the dependencies that are mentioned uh to run this particular script and by doing this we don't have to uh create virtual environments it saves us a lot of time okay okay and where it",
  "it saves us a lot of time okay okay and where it is like installing this Library Char dat yeah it installs these libraries see when I rent it first time you can see here it installed one package in 18 milliseconds why it didn't install for the second time because it already had this package in cach memory I'm asking where is it installing like if it is installing in cach okay cash okay okay it is not installing in our machine actually like we do if we other way also we can write install that",
  "do if we other way also we can write install that particular Library it will install in our machine okay so you can see all these packages over here I don't actually remember how they they are maintaining but all those packages can be seen here and something like what is called it is not visible right like when we do LS where is it actually Cas uh if you go to the user directory and within user directory if you do la then you can see all these hidden files RC okay so if you go to this",
  "these hidden files RC okay so if you go to this particular for folder and then you have a look at uh just CSC here it have caches of different things it have cache of PIP IT have cach of pipex and typescript and then if you go to UV then it will have all these things I don't exactly remember how how it is storing those things but it is somewhere over here okay you nice okay so this code allows you to detect what is encoding for a particular file and then you can use that particular encoding to",
  "and then you can use that particular encoding to open that file so if I now try to read the file so and this encoding I can pass over here and this will get me the content I can even print the content and now I think which I was [Music] in cash first of all and then maybe I was in TDS gen 2025 then I was in Json and yeah this is the file now I do UV run test.py it gets me this particular error because this file name should be D me.txt and now if I execute it and it reads it right so this is",
  "if I execute it and it reads it right so this is what you can get encoding of a particular file and then you can uh open that file with the particular encoding and if you yeah so what happens when when you download some CSV file uh sometimes it it will get some weird characters that is because you haven't provided the correct encoding and if you provide the correct encoding then it will open it as a neat and clean file I mean that text will be human readable all those symbols will get nicely",
  "human readable all those symbols will get nicely rendered okay yeah sh uh in like instead of using withd to open the file uh I guess we should show them how to use this with pandas as well because most of the times they will be using pandas for opening CSV files and that and there they might Fe they might uh face the error of encoding okay okay I will download this file and I will download it as an CC f and now which machine I'm using I think I'm using this machine so I will just copy this and",
  "using this machine so I will just copy this and I will paste it to the desired location and this is where I want to paste it now we can delete theier and I will rename it as data. CSV so it have these values over here and then we have data. CSV um this is to detect the uh what is RB uh yeah are you trying to say say something yes s what is RB when we open data CSV RB as F uh uh R stands for read and I think b stands for buffer I don't remember is it buffer uh I guess it is read bitwise it is",
  "is it buffer uh I guess it is read bitwise it is that okay fine so basically this RB will allow uh the open actually it's an attribute in the open function so it allows you it allows you to actually read this CSV file okay so here we are just trying to detect which kind of encoding this particular file has and then we will be using pandas to import this uh dat. CS all right okay and data. CSV and encoding should be this particular encoding and I can save it in some data frame and just to show I",
  "can save it in some data frame and just to show I can print first five lines e. head of I think five and now I just use this since pandas is not installed okay I will have to put it here all right now I can rerun now it is trying to install pandas and all the dependencies that pandas requires for example if it requires numai it will install all those dependencies along with the pandas so right over here it identified uh wait a second I think yeah this seems correct so it have so this particular",
  "this seems correct so it have so this particular file have asy encoding and then it reads it as this file so this code helps to identify the encoding of the file and then you can just provide encoding over here and if you do that then it will all the symbols will get rered correctly so one thing which you guys might think J can you open that code once sure so one thing you guys uh may be wondering about what is this result and then there is a uh you know a list kind of opening and then we are",
  "you know a list kind of opening and then we are using this encoding so what what is this so actually this is the name of the encoding which we have received from the check okay so you can simply replace this entire thing with asky as well can you do that sure you can simply replace this with a string of asy okay so at first we just simply uh we just checked which kind of encoding this particular file contains and then you can simply write the particular coding okay the name of the encoder like",
  "coding okay the name of the encoder like this and when we will run it it will run as usual okay so if uh you don't want to use that results part that's completely fine you can simply just use it for checking which C of uncoding it has and then you can uh once you have printed out the type of encoding you can check you can just simply write type it over here okay you can do that way as well and I guess it makes it much less complex than using that uh encodings dictionary so if I just try to open",
  "uh encodings dictionary so if I just try to open it in Excel this file gets opened nicely it doesn't have any issue why continue for free [Music] let me try to open the other file so here you can see all these symbols I think they are not very much known to us but they are particular symbols such as these symbols uh these symbols so it don't have the this file doesn't have those symbols because we have just opened it in Excel but instead of opening it in Excel if you first uh identify what is",
  "it in Excel if you first uh identify what is encoding for this particular file and then if you pass that encoding then all these characters will get nicely rendered that is benefit of identifying the charact uh the encoding of the file so if let's say we have an encoding of utf16 and then you are opening the file without specifying the specific encoding so then what it will do is it will just fill all it won't be able to identify which kind of characters you are actually trying to see so it",
  "characters you are actually trying to see so it will simply give you question marks over there okay so you might think that okay these question marks are some kind of symbols but that's not the case those question marks are actually the file not being able to be read properly okay this is what happens so you should always always for any file for any CSV file for any dxt file always check the encoding at first then using that particular encoding use that in pandas and it will be you know you",
  "use that in pandas and it will be you know you will be able to work swiftly with that uh challenge yeah should we do this GitHub question right now or in some other section session because this is very long question it will take a lot of time to explain git and GitHub and uh the different ways in which it can be used we can do it in another session so are we going to use uh WSL in this question uh Yes actually what I have done uh today I have set up another virtual machine which I will be using",
  "up another virtual machine which I will be using for that particular question I what I will be doing I will be uh we already have G installed but then uh I will try to clone a repo it will just clone the repo as usual then I will make some changes and then when I will be trying to push it will give me some error then I will have to configure it all those things will show and usage of personal access token using command line and then you can show using uh how how they can do it using uh vs code",
  "using uh how how they can do it using uh vs code yeah so actually you can run your bash script using the way which Jr is saying you can you know install a a new uh Linux machine you can create a new liux machine and then you can run the bash commands there is also another simple way which you can do and which I prefer actually it is installing a simple extension in in W in vs code okay so the can you just open vs code once sure and in the instructions pallette yeah can you search for WSL yeah",
  "pallette yeah can you search for WSL yeah so this is the extension of WSL which has been you know provided by Microsoft you simply have to install this particular extension and then you will be able to use uh W you will be able to use your Linux machine in vso itself so can you just uh you know drag up the terminal machine from the very bottom from this from this page itself you can just like there is a terminal window in this yeah exactly yeah so you can use your uh WSL and vs code as well",
  "so you can use your uh WSL and vs code as well using this uh yeah you can like it will just create a WSL a Linux environment for you and then you can use WSL using this particular so you know you can uh you should firstly you should learn how JJ is going to actually install uh Linux machine and then how you can run your uh you system commands on your bash commands on a b shell but then when you are actually using it you can perhaps use it in WSL or you can use use it in a BH also okay but sir I",
  "or you can use use it in a BH also okay but sir I have done the same thing but when I open the terminal it doesn't give me like that particular terminal like in wsf when I installed well for that you have to create a new terminal and then you have to select WSL for that so when you are you will be creating a new terminal I guess uh there is a bash written over there no so whenever you're going to create a new terminal it will ask you which type of terminal you have to create so whether it can",
  "of terminal you have to create so whether it can be a Powershell it can be G bash command prompt and aund to as well this open let me let me share the screenshot for that can just a second I will share a screenshot this entire vs code window was like a WSL window so that that is why we were showing it is showing the it is not showing Power share and and all that option okay otherwise you get the open to option Alex yeah okay I'm not able to share my uh share photos for that all right uh no sir",
  "my uh share photos for that all right uh no sir actually like I have a okay I'm getting only two options one is j s such and one is B let me share my screen then what is the screen visible yes sir visible okay so this is my terminal and uh how you can open it simply drag it up like this and then from over here yes yes you can create a new WSL sir I'm not getting this option actually I am using Mac I don't know anything about Mac let it's I haven't used Mac in my life Mac your default is Bash",
  "used Mac in my life Mac your default is Bash Nowa I know bash is there but there are some command that is not working in the like mac so launch like if I may inter what is Bash and like like how how it is being like how does it fit the picture the whole picture well bash allows you to run Linux command and you can run some Linux for instance the command sha sum sha 256 sum which we saw in the last live session so you won't be able to run that in your normal Power Cell window okay so if I run sh",
  "your normal Power Cell window okay so if I run sh 256 some able it will give me an error so but you can run that in your WSL window okay in a pass script or in WSL okay so there is one more topic below that the git and The Bash yeah you know G git can you g requires you to use a bash script for that so like bash is a like it's a universe of uh like it's a universe and git is one part of it okay you can understand in that way it even runs on Powers shell like if you want to yeah it even runs on",
  "shell like if you want to yeah it even runs on Powers shell but it runs on power sh but you can get the Clone thing yeah sh runs on power as well but some commands like shasham these things doesn't work in Parell all right all right of course I have always used A bash script for running get commands but okay say usually usually get bash people use all right right okay also for GitHub you can use this uh you know I guess there is an exension for this as well you can simply use BS code for this",
  "this as well you can simply use BS code for this as well so there is uh for everything there is an extension in BS yeah we can discuss this GitHub thing in some other session maybe you can move to question 14 which have some usage of bash you can run some commands that that requires you to use bash uh all right so uh J are we doing the question right now or are we postponing it to the next live session first actually what we can do right now maybe we can cover rest of the questions just leave",
  "we can cover rest of the questions just leave uh get have one all right if you say so you can do that cuz you know uh the problem is uh it's like it's time and only nine people are here excluding us seven so if you think that uh we should cover those questions we can go ahead how much time do you think it will take to cover those questions uh how many questions are left uh 14 15 16 17 and 18 five questions five questions so the 18th question it requires SQL and it will take a bit of time and uh",
  "SQL and it will take a bit of time and uh I remember that question only that's why I'm talking about that question uh so 18th question will take time and uh I guess the other questions will also take some time so what do you say given the time has you know also the 17th question is comparing files again it will require GitHub as we discussed earlier then there is move and rename it will require uh BH script all right uh so I guess we should you know take all these questions in the next one",
  "you know take all these questions in the next one pretty much because only all right we only have six people with us right now okay okay okay then we'll do it in the next session yeah I want to stretch the yeah sir are you solving the graded assignment questions no we are not solving questions we are just giving directions to solve questions okay yeah because then that would be a felony to solve questions in front of you there are no this question like sh sh sh I will just turn off the",
  "question like sh sh sh I will just turn off the recording then we can have unofficial talks okay all right",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/aJnygTpma7M =====",
  "you have completed the projects and especially one of the projects was exactly like MLP project I guess uh the project uh the first project that you did where you ran like specific that one that uh fitting of six models I guess yes yes fitting of six models all right so that was uh I would say a very toned down version of the of the MLB Pro project so MLB project consists of way more factors than what I did so actually the story behind that project was that one of my friends was uh indulged in",
  "was that one of my friends was uh indulged in a certification course and he requested me to you know uh do assignment for him he was unable to do the assignment so I H in and helped him with that project so that's it so all that all that project actually had was simply training six models on a particular data set it was a pre cleaned data set so I didn't have to do much in for that and then I just ran six models for so like you just ran six models or like you did some kind of fine tuning like",
  "or like you did some kind of fine tuning like you changed the hyper parameters sck number oh yeah I did some level of fine tuning in that uh I ran hyper perameter tuning to for some models I guess but there was nothing like data pre-processing was not involved much there was not much of cleaning which was involved so yeah so I would say that it was a very toned down version of the MLB model MLP project hi San um I was just looking through the project um Do You Believe has been consider uh made",
  "um Do You Believe has been consider uh made the project has been made uh by considering like everyone as equal like a Level Playing Field for everyone you're talking about the uh TDS project project one yeah exactly okay so uh can you please repeat your question once just my question is like has the project been considered has the project been made considering a Level Playing Field for everyone or like uh yeah what's your say on that g can you answer that question so uh if I just open TDS",
  "you answer that question so uh if I just open TDS project so here they have set the background for the problem so they're just making a story and then what you actually have to do in this project you have to create an application which have these two um endpoints so this comes from Fast API or any other API you can use this is just to create an application and these are the this is the method that should be used so they what they will check upon they will send a particular task and then you",
  "they will send a particular task and then you will need to execute that particular task and then this is another thing so how this will work you would have to download some data that will get generated on through this URL and you would have to pass a um parameter to this particular URL and that way you can generate the data once you get the data you will have a folder called data and within that folder so let us say this is one of the question or one of the task you can say so this is format",
  "or one of the task you can say so this is format the content of this particular file using prettier uh updating the file in place so this is one of the uh task that you might have to do and then the file data. data.txt contains a list of date one per line and then you need to count the number of fness days so these are the different kind of tasks that they will require you to do and those tasks will come through this particular endpoint so they will come to your application through this",
  "they will come to your application through this endpoint and whatever application you make you will have to push it to GitHub as well and along with GitHub you will have to create a a Docker uh file and then you will have to push it to Docker Hub and this is the form that you would have to fill so this requires you to fill the GitHub part and this is to uh give the name of the docker uh file and once you do all this uh they they will try to execute your script using this uh command so they will",
  "your script using this uh command so they will use podman to run the image that you have uh submitted through the Google form and these are different these are the stuff so all these will get covered in some of them will get covered in week two and some of them will get covered in week three so this yeah so basically the project is uh is like a pury of each and everything you have learned until now just a second I think most of the time was given to explain the project my question is like uh",
  "to explain the project my question is like uh again like not everyone here has a coding experience and the project expects us to create an application um so isn't that too high a benchmark that is being set for everyone and what if someone had a non-science student who is here to just complete this course in order to get the diploma certificate just find it very overwhelming thank you for the explanation though but I would like your elaboration on the topic on the question that particular",
  "on the topic on the question that particular question that I'm asking so from my point of you it just have three parts one is that GitHub part then another is that publishing to it to docker happened then third part comes from llm so all of these are not very hard stuff and we except expect everyone to learn these things well uh you might not have uh coding coding background but you know what in TDS we are trying to develop that background for you okay so you may come from a non-science",
  "for you okay so you may come from a non-science background you may come from an arts background so over here we're trying to develop that particular background for you okay so whenever you're going to enter the industry you should be ready with all these tools packed up in your you know bag and you should just be able to use all these tools so when you are saying that you might not be you know you're not from a technical background and you might face some you know challenges so those challenges",
  "face some you know challenges so those challenges you have to face okay so that's the only way you can build up that back that background and Bridge up that Gap the technical gap which exists all right so uh for instance a technical person who has you know been in an in in the industry for past you know let's say 10 years I would think that few things in this TDS course will be new to him as well okay so the that Gap that bridge which you have to you know cross may be a long bridge or it may be",
  "you know cross may be a long bridge or it may be a short bridge but you have to cross that so and to assist you in that in Crossing that bridge we are here we are taking these live sessions for you you can use chat GPT you can use any kind of software you want to use to complete these projects so uh uh J are we going to you know uh elaborate on how to creating how we are going to create these applications are we going to show them some demonstration for this uh yes Shan we'll be having",
  "for this uh yes Shan we'll be having dedicated session for project as well and we'll have some so we have some questions related to fast API in week two as well so we will be covering these topics which you lack and in these live sessions you should also consider watching videos from YouTube to understand how these applications work and whatever is us so you know let's not you know let's not just remain in that particular box or of uh it has not been taught to me how can I do this I have been",
  "been taught to me how can I do this I have been I'm not from a technical background how should how can I bro you are doing a degree from it Madras and that's a data science and applications degree so if you lack that background you have to build up so there is no other way and uh for bridging that Gap we are here okay so ask us questions we'll be taking live sessions we'll be taking we'll be we'll be giving you uh uh you know study materials reference materials to study from and uh you have to",
  "materials to study from and uh you have to do it on your own sure thank you so much sir thank [Music] you okay also one more thing which I would like to address to everyone in this meeting uh I have taken two live sessions with jrj yet and what I've noticed is that uh the number of people who actually attend these live sessions regularly are fair L low so there ought to be there's ought to be a you know significant amount of number let's say 500 to 400 to 500 students who are actually enrolled",
  "to 400 to 500 students who are actually enrolled in this course in this current term but as we can see only 15 of us are here and at Peak time there is only like 25 students 25 students is the max I have seen in this in these live sessions so all I want to say is that those contents those techniques which have not been taught in the uh let's say the the week content the weekly content but has been asked in the Gs is being asked in the projects and will be asked in the Roes are being covered in",
  "will be asked in the Roes are being covered in these live sessions okay so we are going question by question for these gas and uh trying to show you guys how you can actually you know uh get around of of these techniques so and not only we are teaching you these techniques we also giving you tips and tricks we are also giving we are also telling you how you can you know ABD these gaps which you might have we are also telling you how you can approach the Roes and the projects in uh you know in a",
  "the Roes and the projects in uh you know in a in a way that you can complete the you can complete them and you can score really well in that so that's good that you guys are actually attending these lectures regularly and that's really appreciable and keep doing that but also encourage your friends encourage your mates who you know uh put this put you know encourage those people who are in those groups of TDS that you are currently in and tell them you know that there are live sessions",
  "tell them you know that there are live sessions happening and you should you know participate in these live sessions and ask your doubts and steady from here you know I've seen people you know posting discourse posts and uh you know messaging on WhatsApp that we have been we haven't been taught SC commands we uh lack this we we haven't like I'm not going to do the data science programming uh diploma so the programming diploma so why are we being taught all these things so uh you know we are",
  "taught all these things so uh you know we are covering everything in these live sessions please tell them please guide them to actually join these live sessions and make these live sessions more lively all right uh also JRA can you show that uh that new feature that that new feature of live sessions we have added all right so uh we have added a very new feature in TDS so if by any chance you miss any live session you can actually you know we have uh curated the entire live sessions into a few",
  "uh curated the entire live sessions into a few important questions which were being asked on in the in those live sessions over here okay so we have questions and then there are answers for those questions so uh by any chance if you miss those live sessions you can any day come here and just get around all these questions and you can you know get a gist of what happened on that live session okay so this has been uh I guess emailed to all you guys uh the link for this particular page or you can",
  "uh the link for this particular page or you can find this on the course page as well okay at the very bottom all right guys let's get started which which which page is this uh can you J can you show them how to reach over here sessions so it's that the main pit the Side Bar if you go to the last bit then you can get the link for these so these were actually created using the transcripts of these live sessions we just put them in a in an AI software and that inputed out all these questions and",
  "and that inputed out all these questions and answers the important questions and answers that is really cool yeah so these will be helpful for you uh during your you know quizzes or whenever you're trying to like during your end term you can just go you can just give a bird ey view of all these questions but instead of rather than going through two hours of live session videos on YouTube all right okay so let's get started uh ja please take [Music] over it should be like a standard for all",
  "[Music] over it should be like a standard for all courses well let's say TDs is you know first and everything just a second sir I would like to uh this is really helpful feature because otherwise you have to watch the Youtube videos my question is tomorrow the session is scheduled at 5:00 p.m. is that by glitch or is it intentionally 5:00 p.m. no it will be at 5:00 p.m. all right so actually we had college classes works so on every Tuesday there there is class between 5 to 7 and on every uh",
  "there is class between 5 to 7 and on every uh wedes dayss we have classes between 9 to 10 and rest of those classes if there is any class that will be between 8 to 10 these timings have been pre-planned all right sir okay so this is the form so if you guys need any support regarding any particular topic then you can even go to this particular form which you can access through like learning feedback over here on Portal itself and then if you are finding some let us say in module one if you have",
  "finding some let us say in module one if you have difficulties related to any of these then you can select them you can even select multiple of them and then you can select whatever suits you in this one and you can fill this form till the very and and then once you submit these responses comes to us and then we use to plan our sessions based on these uh feedback as well okay so anyone here knows about uh what is GitHub what is get and GitHub it's it's like a large Library where a lot of",
  "it's it's like a large Library where a lot of creators provide their like projects and already written programming that can be accessed by other people so they can take inspiration from it I guess uh yes so you can create a repository and then you can uh upload your code there and then others can also work on the same place by forking and creating pool request so now what I will do I will uh start virtual machine one question regarding UV does it not work in work on Windows no it does work in",
  "it not work in work on Windows no it does work in Windows as well so if you go to the documentation of UV then you can find the installations of Windows as well so P install U won't work right uh if pip is installed on UV then sorry if pip is installed on your machine then it would work okay it was not working so I installed in wsn and did it but yeah okay except there is also another method of installing UV in your device for Windows you can check that that work for me I did not have P how",
  "check that that work for me I did not have P how should one how should one download in Mac there is a code for that also you can go to the link that is given in the UV question all the different methods of installing UV is just written there you can just copy paste into your terminal so what so what are we actually going to do over here with GitHub and git so firstly jrj will be showing you how you can actually you know run G along from your command line okay and then I'll be showing you how",
  "line okay and then I'll be showing you how you can actually use it from a vs code so over here I have just set up a new virtual machine uh I think yesterday I have set it set it up and I haven't installed anything on it so this is fresh machine on which we can try working with Git so that if there is issue comes up let us say if we need to configure or we need to do something we can do it in this machine um is this machine not that machine [Music] so let me look what look at all the files that",
  "so let me look what look at all the files that are there in the current working directory so I have created a profile with TDS gen 2025 name and now I will create a directory we go to that directory and now I will initialize this as an git directory so that uh uh I can work on multiple branches and I can even commit it so this will initialize it as in G uh project so let us say if I create a file over here 1. dxt this is first line of code this is second line and once I have initialized it I",
  "is second line and once I have initialized it I can add multiple files to the uh get to track when uh I have committed and then I have done some modifications to it so now I will look for these details of this particular file and then these are they will list which files are not tracked so by tracking files uh get always track if you have committed something or if you have modified something to it so let us say now I commit it before committing something I will have to add files so if I run get",
  "I will have to add files so if I run get add add and then dot this dot what it would do it will add all these files now all these files will get traged with Git so these are the files that are getting tracked with G and now I can commit because it says this can be committed and when I commit I will have to provide some message it can be any message let's say I created I created first file and before you commit something it will ask you for uh setting up those these configurations so it would",
  "setting up those these configurations so it would need the identity of author so now what I will do I will uh give I will configure my user email and I will also configure my username with jit command so think and I will configure them globally and I will use the same uh email address to which I have created my GitHub account so I will use this particular username and the email that I would use is I think you okay I already know which go to emails you can see go to emails okay so these are the",
  "you can see go to emails okay so these are the two emails that I have already added so I will use this iatm one right now and the other configuration that I have to do is regarding the username and which will be this name which is JR hyphen 18 now I have configured it that means now I should be able to make a commit okay so now it says I have created first file this is me message and then this is commit ID now if I look for the status it says nothing is there to uh uh commit and there is",
  "nothing is there to uh uh commit and there is nothing in the teing area as well so and right now we are on the master Branch so when whenever we run git in it it create initializes your git repository on the master Branch okay so now that I have created a uh GitHub repository locally I would like to push it to uh GitHub so that others can also work on the same repository so now what I will create do I will create a new repo and name of the repo can be today's date and you can choose if it",
  "repo can be today's date and you can choose if it should be public or private F and then you can even put some read files that explains about how to run this particular project and yeah you saying that you could have chosen the license as well like like mid license is there so that option you could have chosen but that is fine okay okay so here they have they they are telling us that how we can use it on command line so let us say you create a readme.md file and then you initialize uh the",
  "a readme.md file and then you initialize uh the project using git and once you initialize the project you would have to add this particular file this and then you would have to commit it and then uh uh you make sure that you are on Main Branch and then you will add this particular remote location of uh the repository so now we have done all these steps so we would have to so this grd g g Branch M mean does it like make a new one or does it rename existing wait a second there is some background",
  "existing wait a second there is some background noise in my is there any background noise from my side yes there is some actually okay hi so uh I will deal with this uh G branch and these things a little bit later right now what I will do I will add this particular URL as the G remote git repositories and then we'll try to push to this repo okay now that we have added this this remote repository what I would do I would push the code to a particular Branch since Master Branch I will push it to",
  "Branch since Master Branch I will push it to master now before I push my code it would require me to uh use my username let us say jvrj is my username and then I also know my password so I will try try to type my password but then it would fail because the way they have they are not they are not supporting password authentication as of now so we would need to create personal access token or we might need to set up SSH to do it so now what I will do I will go to GitHub again and then I will get",
  "do I will go to GitHub again and then I will get the personal ex token so if you click over here and over here if you go to the settings option and from from settings if you go to I think is it which [Music] one oh yeah developer settings and inside developer settings we have three options one is GitHub apps and then other is this one and then we need to go over here and then we'll create one new token so I will generate a token now so I will have to name this token I can give any name let me",
  "to name this token I can give any name let me give uh test F or something thing and expiration date let me set it to 7 and it is for public repo only select the maxxum rep and this is read only how does a token help like what are we trying to achieve by a token yeah so when I tried to authenticate so when I tried to push this code to the remote repository on on GitHub then when I try to use my password for GitHub it doesn't work because now now now they have stopped supporting password based",
  "now they have stopped supporting password based authentication we will need to use personal access token for this purpose so from 31st August they have stopped supporting password as an authentication because that that is less secure way because when you generate a personal exess token it generat it's a entirely uh uh random string you can see and it uses it as an password to authenticate that it comes from a legitimate thing so here we have control over if you want to uh so for this particular",
  "over if you want to uh so for this particular token if you want access for only public repository or you want access for all the repos or you can even select which all repos you want this this token can access I mean this token if you have created a token for a particular repo then you won't be able to use it on other repositories but if you create a token for all the repos then you can use it anywhere that is what is there and then here we can U control all these different permissions I think",
  "U control all these different permissions I think commit I will need to give read and write and then if I don't give it uh required permissions then it won't be able [Music] to commit I think and I think I will need to also agree to Administration permises permissions I don't remember which all permissions I had to give but now I will just generate the token and then we'll see if I it works or not now I have copied this token what I would do I will just push it to GitHub I will use my username",
  "just push it to GitHub I will use my username and the token that I have generated now I will use it here permission to this particular repo is denied to JRA 18 the request URL so that is because it doesn't have necessary permissions I will have to generate some other token remember that uh when we like I when I did it I was redirected to GitHub and then I logged in and then it kind of Saved something uh in the system itself and now every time I push it automatically does it so you would have",
  "I push it automatically does it so you would have used vs code is it h yes I used vs code yes vs code does everything for you it is very painless task jrj yeah yes sure can we can you can we show them how you can actually set up the SSH and there would be no then we won't be actually needing the tokens anymore what do you say yeah sure we we'll do that I I don't I don't ex exactly remember which all permissions it needs so if you give the right amount of permissions then it will work maybe some",
  "of permissions then it will work maybe some event follow where can you know what permissions to give you can ask it to GPT and even there are documentations create and modify use for get commands and then this is or else what you can do you can give all these permission then it will for sure work but anyway uh you don't have there is one more way so if you use this GitHub personal access token thing then every time you make a push to uh GitHub then you will have to use this token so let us say",
  "you will have to use this token so let us say if you change something and then you if push it back to GitHub then it requires personal access token every time you do that which is not efficient so other way of doing it is you use something called uh SSH keyp generation thing you will find it in the GitHub docs how do I set up ssh4 so if you go to this particular documentation this the same documentation is also here I think somewhere if you go over here no it's not here anyway if you search on",
  "here no it's not here anyway if you search on internet uh s such authentication on GitHub then you can find find this particular page and then if you run this particular command then you will get a token so now what I will do I will execute this command so what you will have to do you will have to open your bash and then you will have to execute this particular command and then it will generate some a string which will be your which you can use to authenticate on GitHub so if I just press enter",
  "authenticate on GitHub so if I just press enter enter enter it will generate the public key and then I will just copy this path which is here which have do Pub as an extension and then I will just get it I will get this particular these things so now what I will do I will go to GitHub again and then it might be in over here it's right there yes yes is it under uh it's on the left side yeah no no just close this menu over there at the bottom yeah SSH ACC okay yeah thanks so now I will create one",
  "SSH ACC okay yeah thanks so now I will create one new uh key let me call it tdscore key and its type will be authentication key why because we will use it to authenticate while pushing to GitHub and then I will paste the actual key that was generated and then now I will just add it and now that I have added I will go back to the documentation so we have done this part and this have generated it so this is some name what kind of which name you want for the file and I think I will have to use",
  "want for the file and I think I will have to use this but instead of of this particular path what I will have to do I will have to use this path so I'm not using do public because this is private key uh which gets used to authenticate so there is two public and private key that gets generated so private key you can think of it as in lock to the room and then public key you can think of it as in key to the lock so if you have that uh no no actually we provide public key to the GitHub so that you",
  "we provide public key to the GitHub so that you can think of a lock so they use your public key to validate if it is a authenticate user or not could not open a connection to to your authentication agent let me check why it is the case so while you are setting up SSH if you get any error then you can always go to GPT and ask for the help so I would have to start the SSH agent and now it would give me the command to start the SSH agent so if I just do this it will start it so it have started",
  "just do this it will start it so it have started with this particular process ID if you see this kind of output then SSH agent have started now once you have started it you can just use what you have already used so I will reuse it and now this identity had been added to and now I think if I will try to uh push this code again it won't ask for password if it is ask then maybe I will have to restart this machine this General kind of stuff Char GPT is a savior can you repeat RAB comment whenever",
  "is a savior can you repeat RAB comment whenever we are stuck in debugging CH GPT helps a lot yes yes it helps a lot now let me try to again push get push or Master again asks for this thing let me check if it is there J uh try one thing get push H uh Dash you then origin master I think this will also ask for password after adding the S shouldn't asking yeah actually once you have added it it should not ask for this kind of [Music] validation so it is here seems correct to me can we do one uh I",
  "it is here seems correct to me can we do one uh I can take over and I will show them how you can actually use GitHub using vs code in the meantime you can debug this error sure sure sure yeah all right guys is my screen visible someone just open their mic and kindly let me know if it is visible or not yes sure is it yes it's visible it's visible okay all right so uh J just showed you how you can actually how you are actually meant to use GitHub and uh how you can actually run bash commands",
  "and uh how you can actually run bash commands using git bash and uh how you can actually you know connect between your git repo and the uh uh your git repository in your own devices all right so let's see how you can actually achieve that all using vs code so you know vs code is like a software which has which is you know designed to facilitate you in every shape or form okay so there is an extension for let's say uh you can actually send requests using using priner client there are several",
  "using using priner client there are several other types of extensions which actually does a lot for you uh which may take uh consider able amount of time for a uh you know person with not who doesn't have a technical background but GitHub makes it easy for everything all right so let's do one thing let me create a new python file okay let's name it okay let's try and uh put some code in it let's print one okay so this is working all right so uh let's do one thing first and foremost we have to",
  "let's do one thing first and foremost we have to set up a GitHub repository for this particular repo all right so let just first close everything repo is like a collective of code actually uh over here in your own device you will be creating a git instance all right so that git instance will actually allow you to control your version so to actually it will be you know uh actually helping you with Version Control okay so uh I'll will be showing you how it actually you know helps you in Version",
  "you how it actually you know helps you in Version Control in a while and what GitHub actually does is GitHub will GitHub is a place where you can actually store all that information all that uh get that entire git instance on a public domain okay so uh like it's a public platform where you can actually store all those GitHub instances and you can you know repeatedly push your uh code during de during the development so what it ensures is that if by any chance you actually get you know you",
  "if by any chance you actually get you know you delete your code or let's say your machine gets corrupted or anything else your code will be published over here okay so there are also options to actually uh uh let me just show you so it will ask you when you will go to GitHub you just create a GitHub new GitHub account then you have to click on new to create a new repository so this repository is nothing but the GitHub instance the G instance which you actually have on your devices okay so you",
  "you actually have on your devices okay so you just pushing that entire G instance to a public platform so it's like a it's like a folder on a Google Drive instead of our own computer exactly okay so not inad on instead of your own computer but actually it's on both of your devices so it's in addition okay in addition to the folder on our on our device actually so you will have that GitHub that g instance on your device as well also you will have this particular repository where you will",
  "have this particular repository where you will actually you you know uh push new data new uh comits into from your own device and this is like a secondary backup for you and moreover this is how you actually show your own code to some other person and why are we referring to it like git instance because we are actually going to create a new git instance over here in your own device so creating a git instance then using it for Version Control and then we can actually uh transport this git",
  "and then we can actually uh transport this git instance to GitHub okay so first and foremost we have to create a new repository create a new new repository let's say uh it's called it TDS live session so G is the basically version control system and GitHub is just a place where platform to host it are hosted kind of how do we put Version Control how do we put Version Control in simple terms Version Control for instance you have multiple people working on a project all right so let's say you",
  "working on a project all right so let's say you working with me on a project where we have to create a new website okay all right so vers version as in a Google doc like different people working so at different times changes are made kind of kind of okay okay so like I have created so like let's say I'm working on the back end and in the meantime you're working on the front end so uh we have different devices in our systems okay so when we are working on different parts of a project what it can",
  "on different parts of a project what it can do is we can you know uh create an uh we can create a new so these are called actually branches okay so it's like an entire tree so I will be working on let's say Branch Sange you will be working on branch jatin and there is and then there is the mother branch which is called Master Okay so there is there is a master Branch where all that code is merged into okay so it's like a tree uh this is how it works and the Version Control uh this is how you",
  "works and the Version Control uh this is how you actually achieve Version Control so uh multiple people are you know uh pushing their codes to your project and this is how it's getting developed uh you know bit by bit by everyone okay yes so uh while creating this new repository it will ask you that do you want to create it as a public repository or a private repository so that's up to you if you want to keep it private you can do that uh but if you want to show it to everyone in the world so",
  "you want to show it to everyone in the world so that would be require that would require you to mark it as public okay in private you can actually add new collaborators in your repository so let's say if I and jatin are actually working on a project and we don't want anyone else to view this project uh it's get in the get repository uh we don't want anyone to you know view this G repository so what we can do is we can create a private G repository then I can add jatin as a collaborator so only",
  "then I can add jatin as a collaborator so only he and I can actually we see what's happening in this report okay so let's create a public repo for the time being uh I will create a new repository okay so here is your new repository and uh I'll be showing you how you can actually connect this with your kit instance in your device okay so let's come back to our vs code here what I will do is uh I assume that everyone will have this third tab which is Source control okay so if if you will click on",
  "is Source control okay so if if you will click on this third tab you will actually see some text written over here it's saying uh do you want to initialize a new repository and or do you want to publish it to GitHub so you have to click on initialize a new repository okay so we have to create a new instance of GitHub okay initialize so it has initialized a new repository for us no a new initialized a new git instance for us all right now what I can do is uh now that I have created this new file",
  "do is uh now that I have created this new file uh I can commit it to the GitHub instance okay so if you will now go to the actual folder you will see that here it is uh new git instance which has been created okay so some of you might not be able to see this because it has it is actually a hidden object it's a hidden folder hidden directory so how you can actually access this simply click on view then show and then click on hidden items okay okay so if you are not able to see this git folder",
  "so if you are not able to see this git folder then this is the reason okay so just check this hit and item and then you will be able to see this particular folder all right now let's get back over here and now we have to actually uh so what git actually does is just like javr showed you that when you are when you are actually going to commit something when you are going to uh you know save it in your kit instance you have to send a message with it okay so let's send a message okay so this is",
  "it okay so let's send a message okay so this is our first commit so let's send a message of first commit all right now what you can do is you can simply commit it okay let's just commit it once it has been committed okay so can you see this can you see this little node over here at the very bottom at this bottom panel so this is the first node of our tree of our GitHub tree okay so let's say I want to create a let let's make some new changes in it okay so it's print hello world uh let's make it",
  "okay so it's print hello world uh let's make it something like uh you know uh print suround s please print my name so here it has printed my name let's save it and uh now did you see that when I made some changes into this file it has like firstly it was showing you that you can publish it to GitHub but now it it's telling me that firstly you have to commit it to your G instance so understand it this way whenever you are making some changes in your files when you're working with them and there",
  "files when you're working with them and there is a git instance involved in that particular project so at first you have to commit those changes to your GitHub instance okay so this is your GitHub instance and here you have to actually commit those changes then it will actually allow you to push those changes to your GitHub repository okay so is that understood is this process actually under understood or should I you know draw out this some understood sir all right sir but my vs shows open",
  "understood sir all right sir but my vs shows open folder in Clone repository like I have to connect it to git so here when you clicked over here so it's showing you what open open folder and clone Repository so you must have not opened a new folder you must have just opened vs code without even without opening it a new folder is that the case I will just check sir once yeah so just open a new folder uh click over here then open with code command then you will actually be working with a code",
  "then you will actually be working with a code with the folder okay oh all right so all right so uh let's commit this particular change as well so let's name it uh name added okay so this is our name added commit and I will commit it okay so did you see this are you able to see this uh some changes have been done here so our tree is actually growing okay so this was our first commit and then this is our next our second so this is how it actually controls your version so this was a first perit if",
  "your version so this was a first perit if I click over here you can see that what I actually did okay and now when I click over here you can actually see that what new code was added so this is how it actually manages your versions okay so this was let's say this was my version one my first commit it was my version one then this name added commit was my version two kind of okay we can say this is our versions uh and this is how it actually helped you inversion control it actually shows you that",
  "you inversion control it actually shows you that which kind which all lines you have added and what all code you have added in your uh code so this is how it actually helps to inversion control okay let's close this uh all right let so all these changes have been committed to our git instance now what remains is connecting it to our kit repository gith repository all right so how you can actually do that let's click on publish Branch Okay click on publish Branch now it's asking us that we have",
  "on publish Branch now it's asking us that we have to allow this particular extension to sign up with GitHub okay let's allow it it has open this particular page I will click on continue now authorize vs code okay here you have to click on authorized vs code it's asking for my password enter a password and click on confirm Cod and this should work like job all right so it has done it and it's asking us where do you want to publish this uh public rep so we will be publishing this to the public",
  "rep so we will be publishing this to the public repository okay so the repo name what did I actually mention is TDS live session okay so I will enter the name of my repository okay so it will ask you to enter the name of your repository which you want to actually connect with for this particular uh GitHub instance for this time this is the name of our G repository and I will be publishing it to the public repository okay so it's giving me two options either you can publish it on private",
  "two options either you can publish it on private repository or public reposit I will be checking the clicking on the public repository option okay so okay so it's saying gith repository already exists all right should work then okay I think rather than searching for a name it's actually creating a new one that's why it's sh it already exist and you can's click on Escape uh I'll make one more change over here let's this and save all right turn push okay it's asking us to add a remote Okay add a",
  "okay it's asking us to add a remote Okay add a remote repository name it's giving us all those repo names which which we can actually use okay so it's asking for the remote name all right let's Okay is it's orig I think it have done something maybe it have created a new Ru I don't know just try to refresh MH well what I usually do is I initially I set up this entire connections with Bash commands and then when it has been actually set up entirely then I use it for committing I'm just trying to",
  "then I use it for committing I'm just trying to show you guys if it is possible to actually establish a connection without running a command Okay so is possible all right it has done it so I just refreshed my page and now it has done it and as you can see that here is my tr. iynb file and uh should contain all my changes which I okay so this is the this is the code and uh when you will go outside over here you can see that another change so this was the this is the message of our most recent",
  "was the this is the message of our most recent commit which we uh committed all right so now whenever I will make some new changes let's say uh let's set another name okay let me add Jr's name Jr's name okay and okay it's printing it let's commit it once again I will click on uh I will uh let's give it a message of jrj name added all right so this is the message and now what I will do is instead of clicking on this commit button I will click on this arrow for more actions then I click on Commit",
  "arrow for more actions then I click on Commit and push okay so it has successfully done that and let's check yes it has done it so as you can see that this is the most recent comit which it has made so let's check if there is some change in our code as well all right so as you can see that it has you know committed those changes and now javr is also present on the board okay so this is how you can actually uh use vs code for managing everything for managing the entire git uh your git",
  "for managing the entire git uh your git repositories and I would say this that this is much more convenient than running bash commands in WSL or you know GitHub G bash so that's uh much more convenient and I usually use this one this this particular option uh what I did what I actually do uh different from what I have done right now is that for I establish this entire connection with the git repository firstly and then I actually start using it so initially I just you know get create a new git",
  "so initially I just you know get create a new git git repository establish a connection with the uh repository sorry uh create a new git instance create a new repository then establish the connection between them and then I uh simply use it for committing or you know committing more changes changing to different branches creating more branches so that's how I usually do it uh yeah so any questions for this particular part it also so at one point like it try to create a brand new repository uh",
  "like it try to create a brand new repository uh like was that new even for you yeah absolutely so as I said that I usually uh do it like I firstly establish the connection between the repositories and the get instance using bash commands then I use it so that was new for me as well but somehow it worked I guess uh it will work when you will actually click on you know uh commit and push so let's make one more change okay saved and uh just click on uh this one then commit and push then what it",
  "on uh this one then commit and push then what it will actually tell you it will actually basically basically what ask where to push it yeah so uh it will ask you to add a remote so remote is something like uh that that actually establishes the connection between GitHub and git in your par in your device okay this is how you actually establish the connection and it will ask you for that remote you have to enter that and then it will allow you to establish your connection okay this saves a lot of",
  "your connection okay this saves a lot of hassles for us to like rather than going into terminal writing up lot of CES you can simply do this exactly so rather than going to terminal you can simply do everything in vs code so this is this is the uh quality of vs code which you can utilize all right so any questions all right so I guess there are no not any more questions for this so jaaj uh should we move ahead uh sure sh basically problem with the why I was facing problem with committing was",
  "the why I was facing problem with committing was because what I had added in the remote was https so for that I had to use uh personal access token so I have to change my remote URL to the ssh1 all right all right so uh I guess whenever you are creating a new repository it's it actually gives you an SSH uh URL and then another URL for REM adding a remote yeah yeah so there are two two ways to add remote URL one is through SSH and another is through https so if you use https one then uh so if",
  "https so if you use https one then uh so if you just go to some repo just go to one of your repos should I create a new repo no no you can go to any existing repo so if you click on code button over here just click on code button code code the green one like in the center so here you can get the option of SSH and https so you would have to use the appropriate uh connection if you have you are using SSH then you will have to use that as a remote URL so uh what I was thinking of doing is uh a",
  "URL so uh what I was thinking of doing is uh a what do you say should I show them how like there was some you know some errors with my uh part as well so there was some you know some hiccups in my uh part so what do you say that should I show them how I usually do this like really fast or should we continue I think if students would do it by themselves then if they face any issue they can take help from s uh GPT so I think right so let's move ahead then next question was yours I guess next",
  "ahead then next question was yours I guess next question was to like install k p I guess yeah Terminals and WSL uh is gbass and WSL essentially [Music] same well I would say that get bash uh won't allow you to execute few commands which are present in Linux which actually WSL will so that's my experience so uh I when I was doing SC syst commands I tried to use git bash instead of installing a new uh instead of using WSL and it won't allow me to execute some command so that's why so there is a",
  "execute some command so that's why so there is a difference between them so there is some limitations in G bash but I guess WSL gives you full freedom anything you [Music] want just a question when I'm trying to connect my vs and GitHub it is showing me to configure my user name and email where do I do that so when when you were trying to make a commit right uh yes I I I was following San and I was doing as a little behind him but somehow I landed up my connection is not proper uh is it from vs",
  "up my connection is not proper uh is it from vs code or from terminal are you doing vs code V code so you were in vs code and when you try to commit something or when you were trying to establish a connection yeah it is it is saying saying me make sure you configure your user.name and usern email in G and then opens maybe J what you can do you can share your screen yeah sure sir that would be better is it visible yeah it is like I did like this you open this some point of time in your display I",
  "open this some point of time in your display I I made a new account I made a new repository TDS repository this is the name I also put the same name I then start made a python file hello world I typed this now when I'm doing commit it takes me here and open git lock this is opening output missing some step this is your file which you have opened yeah print hello world okay do one thing uh write a message over there here in the source control Source control okay yeah write a message anything",
  "Source control okay yeah write a message anything instead of clicking on Commit you can uh click on the Arrow once commit and push okay open get loog does it does the git account like I just created the git account um chatin I think you would have to configure get using some line of code I have pasted two lines and the chat box just try to do it copy them one by one where do I need to cop paste this in the terminal n vs code go to terminal yeah this below menu the menu which has been opened at",
  "this below menu the menu which has been opened at the below uh so if you yes yeah let space it here and then you uh use double codes uh put your email address and there is one more command in the chat box no you have to make sure that it's the same email that you open the GitHub account with yes yes you can copy name okay now try to commit okay it has no remote branch no mean so uh now click on okay okay it's doing something okay would you like vs code to periodically run get fetch click on yes",
  "code to periodically run get fetch click on yes I think it's committed just wait for some 30 seconds maybe it will commit uh can you go back to vs code can we make some change over here in the code any changes like changes hello world to your own name anything I think uh it it have logged it up uh just close this file and then go to your you know directory or that yeah this first one click over here now you can make some okay go back to Source control the third one the third tab yeah now",
  "control the third one the third tab yeah now instead of clicking on Commit no no no just cancel this instead of clicking over here uh click on this that Arrow which arrow sir this one yeah yeah this one uh commit and push should ask you to add a new remote all your changes and commit them directly uh all right click on [Music] yes branch is up okay so we haven't added any message over here that's why it's stuck enough it's going to run this forever uh so what is the way to get rid of running it",
  "uh so what is the way to get rid of running it forever is it just close the close it once close it okay okay close this close close vs code as well okay it has stopped yes open it once again okay uh okay it has opened that exact folder now go to uh Source control one again now enter some message so remember this whenever you're trying to commit something always enter a message otherwise it will be stuck in a for Loop and uh not a for Loop a while loop while true yeah make some changes in the",
  "loop while true yeah make some changes in the file as well otherwise it won't allow you to commit no no no no cancel this cancel this click on that Arrow commit and push commit and push okay there are no ST changes click on yes okay that's established this all right uh I guess it has not established any connection with the kit repo yeah it has not established those connections with the git rep uh go back to that yeah refresh this page it has it hasn't done that part what we can do is instead of",
  "done that part what we can do is instead of like focusing instead of trying to do this part this you know connection part with vs code we can run few commands in the starting and then it will allow us to establish then then we can you know do everything with vs Cod and check can you open that b okay now uh uh J can we run bash commands in Powershell as well Powershell no not in power okay can you open Terminal he he can run from terminal okay okay no you you can use the vs Cod how uh just uh",
  "okay no you you can use the vs Cod how uh just uh place your cursor at the very bottom now no no no above this and it will show you an two-headed Arrow uh little below little below no no over this this particular border like there is a black border put it there yeah the line yeah yeah a little bit lower yeah yeah yeah there it was a little bit up like right between the the the cross-section of the light black and the dark black J yes sir yeah there it was uh here just pull it up all right so",
  "there it was uh here just pull it up all right so now what we can do is we can run few get commands to establish this connection okay uh uh click on git type git status enter okay your branch is up to date with origin main all right we can make this connection using a particular command and it is uh just go back to your get repo once okay just scroll down here you can see the second last line the second last command no Above This above this particular block of code yeah this one the second last",
  "block of code yeah this one the second last command get remote add origin copy this paste it here and run it okay uh you can set it up that there is a way to update uh the current one so you can just set it up so uh just you open chat GPT and ask it how do I update remote repo in get I think it might have some other repo how do I update a remote repo and get charge is thinking Ser busy uh usually it should work like this uh can you type get remote hyphen V get remote space hyphen V Space hyph",
  "hyphen V get remote space hyphen V Space hyph uh is it correct repo I think yeah sweet no the repo is different there is a TDS repo that's created it should be TDS live session instead is it yes sir this is the one I created right now okay okay so there is a way to update the URL I don't remember how to do guys what we can do is no updated five minutes it created a brand new repository in itself created a brand new repository no the vs code created itself oh yeah what we can do is uh I can",
  "created itself oh yeah what we can do is uh I can share my screen once and I will show you the entire process like in a very streamlined way how you can know simply create and then use vs code to do everything so this has already created but it's private so I can make this public and this works fine I guess yeah it can work but the thing is that we have to you know uh when you create a new repository you should be able to connect it with the uh git instance in your device it's should not create",
  "instance in your device it's should not create a new repo and then you know uh itself and then give you a new repo this isn't how it should work you just stop sharing all right I will uh quickly show this part because it has already consumed a lot of time okay Shan we can even cut from cut from here to uh keep it a separate video and then maybe we can update this upload this particular recording in two different parts uh I uh can you please repeat I wasn't able to understand what you just say",
  "I wasn't able to understand what you just say what you are doing right now you are trying to uh create a repo and then push it from vs code yeah in seamless manner right so you will do everything in a structured way what we can do we can uh cut from here till where you um till when you complete discussing this GitHub part and then we can upload it as a as fun as a as a video on YouTube yeah on you right all right then that would be much more helpful for everyone all right so I will be start I",
  "for everyone all right so I will be start I will start explaining everything uh like I'm you know I will be explaining in a new video all right so guys uh over here we are trying to establish over here we are trying to actually uh create a new grit instance from our device and then actually establish a connection between the a new repository on your GitHub on our GitHub account all right so first and foremost create a new folder over here okay and I want you guys to you know uh kind of go along",
  "I want you guys to you know uh kind of go along with all these steps okay I will be creating this new folder let's give it a name of GitHub okay let's open this and uh let's open it with code okay because we are actually going to work with VSS code on so let's create a new file and I will name this file okay let's call it uh uh let's call it GitHub okay because why not and it would be an iy NB file okay now what we can do is simply write some lines of code hello world okay let's see a new",
  "lines of code hello world okay let's see a new kernel so this selecting a new kernel is just exclusive to IP NB files you won't be required to do all this in Python notebooks python files okay so I've done this what we can do right now is okay so this was the first step create a new folder then create a new file in that folder okay so and the next step is go over here right click show more options then click on get bash here okay so this get bash here these op these two options get UI get GUI",
  "here these op these two options get UI get GUI here and get bash here these two options will be available only when you have installed git in your systems okay so uh I will just click on git bash here okay and now it will give you a new window uh let's enlarge it a bit okay what I will do is firstly I'll be running few commands so these commands would be like uh uh like a uh you know foundation stone for establishing this connection and then after that we can we will be using vs code for",
  "after that we can we will be using vs code for managing everything in our G repository all right so uh the First Command which you have to write in order to establish a git instance is git in it okay so this is the first command uh just simply enter it so it has it has created this new uh G instance right in your folder okay which we created and uh if you guys are not able to see this particular folder so that's because it has been actually hidden so this is an a hidden folder so that's why uh",
  "so this is an a hidden folder so that's why uh you may not be able to see this particular folder what you can do is simply go to view okay then go to show and then go to hidden items okay so I have checked this hidden items that's why it's showing me this uh hidden folder otherwise if I just click over here and then it will just vanish okay so it would be better just simply click on hidden items and now I can see this particular folder right over here okay now what you have to do is uh I will",
  "here okay now what you have to do is uh I will make uh uh look okay let's check what is the status of our uh git instance so it has it just said me that you have a untracked file which is g. I NB gi. I NB so what I will do is uh I will just add this file in a Tracker so it it is now tracking it now when you will click on when you will run this get status command once again it will show you in Greens okay so this shows that all these so red means that this is not being tracked by GitHub and",
  "that this is not being tracked by GitHub and green means that it is being tracked by GitHub okay so you are uh you're playing it's safe when it's green Okay so uh when this is done what you have to do you have to establish the connection okay and for that let's go to our page okay so this is my GitHub account okay if you don't have it simply create a new GitHub account it's free obviously okay simply create a new GitHub account and now we have to create a new repository GitHub repository for",
  "to create a new repository GitHub repository for that simply go to this repositories tab Okay now click on new okay so this will create a new repository for you clicking over here now it will ask you for a repository name let's name it uh GitHub it should Capal GitHub demo okay because I'm giving you a demo that's why otherwise you can keep any name you want okay and also names of GitHub repository should be uh you know the spaces you can't do this okay so you have to whenever you have to give",
  "okay so you have to whenever you have to give a space simply replace it with a hyphen okay this is how it works in GitHub now here you can add some description okay GitHub demonstration okay now it uh it gives you the option of selecting whether you want this particular demo this repository to be P public or private so what does public and private mean public as the name suggests everyone on the internet can see this and and uh uh there will be no restrictions on whoever is watch whoever is",
  "be no restrictions on whoever is watch whoever is seeing this uh particular repository and private is for those cases whenever you are like you're working for a uh you're working for a company and they don't want to expose their code to the entire world which is most of the times which is true most of the times so then we will use a private repository so private repositories are exclusively uh shown to the collaborators so whenever you are creating a PR repository it will ask you do you want to",
  "a PR repository it will ask you do you want to add new collaborators okay so collaborators are those people who you actually give access to your private repositories okay so for this uh particular demonstration I will be going with public obviously I don't care whoever sees my Hello World okay so uh simply select public and then create repository okay so this has been done here you are on this page now over here in this particular chunk of code you will get this command get remote add origin",
  "you will get this command get remote add origin okay copy this command copy this entire command then go back to a g g bash paste it so how does pasting happen in uh vs code it's done by uh sorry how does pasting happen in get bash it's done by clicking on the uh right Mouse click and then paste okay this is how you actually paste in git bash press enter so over here what it actually did is it actually established a new connection from your device to the GitHub repository okay so uh this has",
  "to the GitHub repository okay so uh this has established this connection now you are free to do whatever you want okay so let's head back to our GitHub okay so here it is uh I will now how you can actually access that GitHub uh uh that that GitHub instance so over here you can see few Tabs are uh present over here simply click on this Source control okay now this Source control will actually allow you to manage your GitHub instance and along with that it will help you to uh push those",
  "along with that it will help you to uh push those particular changes to your GitHub repositories as well okay so uh for committing these changes so commit basically means that you are committing okay I'm going to push these changes right now at this instance all these particular changes should be pushed uh to my GitHub repository okay so whenever you're going to commit something always always make it a habit of yours always write a message okay otherwise sometimes it will just go in a V Loop",
  "otherwise sometimes it will just go in a V Loop and not a v Loop so because uh like it will be like a never ending cycle it will just keep on running and running uh and nothing will happen so simply write a message so I will write a very generic message which is first commit okay so this is my first comit now what you have to do is when you click over this don't click on this particular button okay rather click over this particular Arrow this arrow and then click on Commit and push okay so it",
  "and then click on Commit and push okay so it has okay the branch master has no remote branch okay okay sir I'll take your leave thank you for the session all right so I will click on okay and let's see if it has actually done okay so uh this is how you can actually uh use so uh you can now just make some more changes let's say uh you can make more changes and uh whenever you save them it will actually ask you to commit these changes okay so as you can see that these particular changes have been",
  "can see that these particular changes have been reflected in my GitHub repository simply open this and you can see that code okay it's opening okay so here is my code and this is how you seamlessly establish an connection from your GitHub instance git instance not GitHub get instance from the device to your geta repositories okay so this is the entire process which I actually use okay it's a mix of vs code and bat commands okay all right so this was the end of it thank you all right so uh",
  "this was the end of it thank you all right so uh anyone have any questions in this particular section see only using so in the work that I that you guided me to do at what instant did we create the git git instance at what point of time get in it uh I did not use that command like yeah you must have clicked uh on create new instance I guess I did not so that might be the case with your problem I guess and uh somebody mentioned WSL bash and Powershell uh these three are softwares for running the",
  "uh these three are softwares for running the vs code no no these are terminal softwares yeah these are terminals so these are available in your vs code uh so uh here is your Powershell you can create a new get bash right here okay if I click on get bash so this is a bash script open right here I can uh what which whatever I did WR over here I I could have done this in know G in this git bash script as well okay it's like an inbuilt terminal for the vs code and you can essentially choose which",
  "the vs code and you can essentially choose which software to run the terminal on it can be power it can be G pass whichever one is installed in your PC it will show there and what is the by default like I did not make any changes what is the by default power Shi all right yeah okay so this was it and also I guess no one has any problems with that GitHub question uh so jav should we move ahead uh sure I see only four students are remaining at the moment that is because it took a lot of time in",
  "moment that is because it took a lot of time in configuring it at my end I have done it a lot I think one year ago or something uh I guess we should proceed with the uh bash questions right sure yeah so anyone have any idea how would you do this question you download the files you extract it and you essentially write the script which allows you to do the questions like in this specific one it is asking us to replace all the iitm case insensitive into IIT madas you write a script that",
  "into IIT madas you write a script that essentially does that you run the script so that all the files get changed according to that and then you open a terminal then you put in the directory where the file is located at and then you run this code it should give you an output which goes here in the answer section yeah so what kind of uh script would you be writing python Java depends on you it just needs to get the file changed depending on what the question is all right okay I was using python",
  "the question is all right okay I was using python in the most case at one point I did Java but then again I started using python Bell uh when you created that python script uh how many lines did it took to write that entire there are four questions in this GB section in average it was like 10 to eight lines of codes I guess we will show you how you can do that entire thing in with just one line of code actually what you can do you can even use set editor so what said will allow you to do you",
  "set editor so what said will allow you to do you can uh run across all those files that are in this particular folder and then uh you can match with the iatm and then you can replace it with i space medas basically now I want to be coding it I will ask GPD to code it for me again so the motivation behind using said editor is it is very much fast and I think most of us already know how we can do it in Python because that we are almost familiar with it so it is uh we can try some other way of",
  "with it so it is uh we can try some other way of doing the same question can you solve it using S editor also jaaj please uh remove that unzip part from The Prompt otherwise it might give some you know unzipping code as well sure there there are multiple files [Music] in folder [Music] think replace all ATM withm address in all the files leaving as okay I guess it has given us the code to to actually you know run through each and every file and then run this said command yeah so if you look",
  "then run this said command yeah so if you look over this particular uh piece of code and if we just go to this particular uh directory and let me create one more directory over here let me create it uh a test directory so right now I have one file and one directory and within test I can create one more file let's call it a two so now if I go back here I have one directory one file and in test directory we have another file so now what I will do I will just try to execute this particular command",
  "will just try to execute this particular command and instead of this path to directory what I will do I will just put dot so this dot means current working directory and then it have got us these files so this is file from test folder this is file from the current directory and these are files from dogit directory that is from hidden directory so if we just do la then it will show this hidden directory as well so uh this find command what it it will try to find all these files because we have",
  "will try to find all these files because we have asked to find files by stating type as file instead of stating type as file if I do type as directory then it will match with all the directories so it is matching with current directory and then it is also matching with test directory then it is matching with these different directories which are present in uh git dogit folder so anyone have any doubt till now JRA let's do one thing let's create two txt files which will contain your name chrj",
  "two txt files which will contain your name chrj and then we will try to ex we will try to replace J with Sange what do you say all right okay let me create two files I will just remove this particular of removing it I will just go back and get some other folder to cd2 now I create two file over here VI and have text and then I will create another file which have no no no no just just uh write jrj and some more text with it like jrj is cool let's go okay so in first we have just Jr and in second",
  "go okay so in first we have just Jr and in second file we have Jr's now what I will do I will try to copy and paste the same code which JP have given me jaj rather than like copying this entire code let's show them how you can use actually how you can use the set commands first okay okay so we will be we will just replacing J with Sange for let's say this first file this one file okay so when I use cat command it lists it here what was the way okay so I can use and then what I will use S which",
  "so I can use and then what I will use S which is for substitute and then I will try to match it with chiv and then I will change it to shange and if I put Global over here that means wherever it matches JRA it will change it to Shan instead of global if I put one then it will change it with the first occurrence of JRA and instead of one if I put two then it will change the second occurrence so right now I will just put Global over here and then I will mention first file and now on the standard",
  "I will mention first file and now on the standard output on the terminal we are getting Shan over here but let me have a look at what is in the file so in in file it is it is still JRA right now right now what I will do I if I just give minus I option so for any command in bash there is something called option is like um they provide different options for example this minus I what it would do it will uh save all those changes to the same file so earlier it didn't change in the same file instead",
  "earlier it didn't change in the same file instead what it have done it have uh outputed the changed text to the terminal but now if I give minus I option it will change it in place now if I try to look at the same file it have shans in it so if there are multiple lines yeah sh yeah let's do one thing uh we can like uh let's show them how you can also manage case sensitive values let's say uh in these particular files we had Jr with the J capital and rest all of those alphabets were cursive but",
  "and rest all of those alphabets were cursive but let's just you know change something like let's make the i letter caps lock and few more changes and then show that does this command run then I just wanted to ask these commands are a part of uh which language or which module are they bash commands so if you if you have bash yeah okay can right now I will open it in the same editor change it to let us say small J capital i v r j let's make it random let's make it something random R caps J gsog",
  "let's make it something random R caps J gsog let's let's do this yeah okay spiced up a bit now instead of writing it out to the file I will just to the editor I mean the terminal itself so now it haven't changed right yeah it has it haven't changed anything it just outputed what was inside that uh file it just gave you Jr with those scrambled up words okay so it's not actually you know searching with with it's not like changing the it's not searching with the case as well it's actually",
  "not searching with the case as well it's actually searching Jr where the J caps loock and rest all the letters are cursing so this is how it's actually working so rather than this if we want to introduce you know like case sensitivity as well what we can do is uh there is an option I guess jrj there is an caps lock I option uh if I am remembering correctly uh let us try that out hyphen capital I and what happened oh that is an invalid option I guess it was Hyphen a or I okay uh so if you",
  "I guess it was Hyphen a or I okay uh so if you remember what is option then you can always in the manual if you type man and rather rather we can simply go to chat gbt and ask yes that is easier way uh so yeah just tell we want how do I enable case in sensitivity only two people are remaining in this meeting in s okay we have to put minus I as a flag at the end let it should be like I and G both right yeah I is for insensitivity and G is for globally okay now let me try this you haven't",
  "for globally okay now let me try this you haven't mentioned the file oh okay did you guys see this it actually you know it worked uh it searched all those you know it Serv jrj without any case sensitivity and it actually replace it with Min name so this is how you are actually going to you know change iatm with I madas so this is actually the code which this is the way which you are going to change those make those changes this will be on line instead of the Python script that we write for 10",
  "instead of the Python script that we write for 10 absolutely this just a one line code and also remember one thing uh jaaj the I option we have to include the option right to make the changes permanent yes if you want to write it out to a file then you will have to provide minus I option that will change the file itself so this is how you are actually going to make those changes all right and then you can create the loop same way that it have created a loop over here it is using it is first",
  "created a loop over here it is using it is first trying to locate all the files and then it is executing this particular command so this what is this exact it allows you to execute uh any command so this find uh find command have a option minus execute so it will allow you to execute any command over there anyway oh challenge yeah this was my question right let me share my [Music] screen so can we continue from the next what do you say only two guys are remaining in the meeting [Music] um",
  "two guys are remaining in the meeting [Music] um should we continue from next session what should we what do you say [Music] are you there yes let's try to complete it I think from next because you know these live sessions will be uploaded to YouTube and let's you know let's go ahead with this part all right so uh the question let me open question once okay where it is yeah so the question was we actually have to okay it is okay so we have to uh use this LS command to get all the you know uh",
  "uh use this LS command to get all the you know uh the size and the modification dates of all these files which are present in the directory so I won't be downloading this uh Z folder and I won't be extracting this to uh you know fetch out all all those files which are actually present in the uh zip folder but uh what we can do is we can instead let's go ahead uh where it is okay uh I'll be working in this GitHub one okay so I will be creating a bash script right now okay no not a bash script I",
  "bash script right now okay no not a bash script I will be creating a WSL script okay this is the WSL terminal and uh how you can actually access this WS ter because whenever if you are going to like click over here and then you will see that okay San said that you should be able to find an AB tol but there is nothing so for this you can what you can do is you can simply go to the extensions Tab and search for WSL and you have to download this one okay so this is the extension which you have to",
  "okay so this is the extension which you have to actually install simply click on the install button and it will install this extension and then you have to you know restart vs code and then you will get this WSL uh uh terminal all right so let's use LS command and I will be using LS L all right so LS what does LSL actually does this it will give you the entire you know it will give you the entire uh details about this file so uh this is the this is the user of this file this is the size of this",
  "is the user of this file this is the size of this file and this is the date it was last edited all right so what we can do is so if you look at the question it's asking us that you know you have to filter you have to filter out those particular files which are at least this amount of uh have this amount of bite storage in them and then you have to uh filter out this uh particular thing so uh I would say that uh instead of actually doing everything in bash why not combine our techniques and",
  "in bash why not combine our techniques and tools to make it much more easier for us all right so what we can do is rather than doing this what I will do I will print this entire thing so whenever you are whenever you are solving that particular question so you will get a series of you will get an entire list of uh these details because I have just one file that's why it's showing me just one instance okay so what I will do is I will save this entire output so this is the output of Ls iph L I",
  "entire output so this is the output of Ls iph L I will save this entire output to a file okay and that file would be let's say uh let's name it details. dxt okay so it has created this particular file all right can you guys see this also it has added its own uh details as well so that's two instances for you and uh here is the file which you can use okay so now let's do one thing so what I'm actually thinking of doing is because we have to perform some you know filtering tasks and uh something",
  "some you know filtering tasks and uh something related to uh yeah we have to perform s filtering tasks so what comes to mind when you think of filtering out data can anyone just tell me which software comes to mind when you're thinking of filtering out stuff [Music] anyone the answer is Excel okay so simple you can simply you know filter out everything in Excel okay so let's do one thing what I will do is I will uh so I will use multi cursor over here okay so how does multi cursor work simply",
  "here okay so how does multi cursor work simply press down alt and then you will be able to use multiple cursors okay so this is how multic cursors works and what I will do is I will uh press control and then it will just jump to the end of that particular word okay now what I will do is I will insert a comma I will I will just delete that space then again control and uh right arrow key Arrow uh sorry comma and then delete this one control and right arrow comma delete control right right arrow",
  "arrow comma delete control right right arrow comma delete okay control right arrow comma delete okay so uh now we have come to the you know the time it was actually edited so instead of placing comma right here what I will do is I will place comma right here okay this is where I will be placing this comma and uh it has been done okay so your uh so this is your CSV file what I will do is I will simply save it and then I will change rename this file to uh let's say XL let's call it let's give it",
  "to uh let's say XL let's call it let's give it xlx xlsx okay so uh this is our Excel file now okay just opening okay okay XLS not valid it's saying it's not valid okay uh let's give it CSV instead okay let's open it all right are you guys able to see that we have this entire CSV file to us now what you can do is simple yeah J you were saying something no no I was just adding yeah okay so you have this entire CSU file to you now I won't be showing you how you can actually filter stuff so that's",
  "you how you can actually filter stuff so that's for you to you know find that find it out if you are not much in experienced with Excel uh if you are experience then that's uh cew for you okay so you can right here filter out stuff and this is how you are going to so as you can see that it has converted it to date time format as well okay so what else do you need okay simply run those filtering options and you will be able to solve this question so that's it and this question has been solved",
  "so that's it and this question has been solved any questions no sir so actually you have been quite quiet the entire uh meeting do you have any questions or anything to add saki no sir actually I'm trying to just understand the whole actually uh I've taken the class uh from the starting so I'm just grasping the what we can do and how can we use WSL and virtual machine so we can so that's why I'm not asking but I understood everything and I will try it on myself and then if I have a doubt then",
  "try it on myself and then if I have a doubt then I'll will ask you about it sure uh you feel free to you know tag to me uh on your discourse posts asking me anything okay so that's my job and uh that's uh that we are being you know we are uh being told to do okay so feel free and just go ahead and ask your questions on this course okay yes thank you so I guess uh this everything has helped you guys okay so uh this was the last question of our entire live session uh and because we have",
  "of our entire live session uh and because we have significantly less number of students with us right now so I guess we will be taking the rest of the portions in the next live session okay so uh any feedback uh you guys may have J can you please like switch off the recording I guess we can have uh you know foral discussion",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/0e0RhXREnxU =====",
  "right so we've started the recording now uh good evening everyone and uh welcome to uh the 21st of Jan session for tools in data science um our main agenda for today is to discuss um the tools that you will that have been left pending from the previous sessions mainly with an eye of covering tools that uh you will need in G2 we'll also take doubts along the way as well U if there are things that we can um answer but our main focus will be dealing with ga1 and ga2 type things because of the",
  "with ga1 and ga2 type things because of the deadline that's approaching okay and I've noticed this someone Vishnu sad why are you sad Vishnu by the way you can open your mic and speak okay there is no issue here so an MTI has raised his hands go Hi C sorry re we I have raised this question so how much in depth these things are needed like like obviously it will be needed in the project but how from our side how much depth should we learn uh these tools so that we will be able to do the be bare",
  "tools so that we will be able to do the be bare minimum and we'll be able to finish the task it is possible hello sorry I I just realized I was on mute okay uh so the um purpose of the um sessions and uh this Tools in TVs right and is to expose you to the tools give you sufficient proficiency so that you can uh execute the purpose of the tools so you know for example when we looking at something like Fast API right what do what's the purpose of fast API so that you don't need this huge combers",
  "fast API so that you don't need this huge combers some library in order to uh produce API endpoints right you want to be able to iterate quickly and have something up and running within a matter of minutes or maybe maximum like 2 three hours right something that used to take a lot of time to do before fast API can literally pull you can pull up push out something within minutes uh that's just uh you know so we will give you those the ability to appreciate what the tools can do we won't go",
  "to appreciate what the tools can do we won't go through all the nitty-gritty options and we won't expect you to learn all the Integrity options and all the nuances uh and we won't test you on the nuances of the tools so for example when it comes to an end term we're not going to ask you questions that are very vague and very our goal is not to penalize you right our goal is to see this is the tool that you understand how this tool works are you able to do the basic things with this tool to",
  "you able to do the basic things with this tool to achieve a certain specific outcome right and you'll get a sense of that in the project as well project is not going to require to become expert at the tool but it will make you understand this is the task this is how this tool plugs in into that task and there are several such tasks and there are several such tools I need to put together so that I have some something cohesive some cohesive whole that produces something of Great Value so that is",
  "that produces something of Great Value so that is um that's what you'll see in Project see so far the M main questions that many people have been asking is you know why there are so many tools I'm overwhelmed and I understand that but that's because most of the tools are lacking a sense of an overarching story to them right uh but unless we introduce those to you we can't build the project so that's uh that's the idea behind it uh only basic knowledge will suffice yes so in that sense only",
  "knowledge will suffice yes so in that sense only basic knowledge will suffice um and U how deep you go with it uh that's a will be up to you to take it forward it won't so you're saying basic knowledge won't suffice well we'll demonstrate it to you right show you how simple these things are they're not as difficult the main skill I think that many people find challenging who particular are not good at programming is uh reading and understanding documentation once you pick up that skill then",
  "documentation once you pick up that skill then these things become actually very straightforward that is usually the biggest challenge um when you start on this journey will find the documentation overwhelming it'll take you a lot of time to understand what's happening um and that's there is a natural resistance uh to learning through documentation but when you get into the workplace that's basically how you'll have to deal with it um so I understand that uh and that's why these sessions we are",
  "that uh and that's why these sessions we are conducting I mean if you compare with last term right so last term we barely did two sessions a week uh this within the space of uh a few days we have already now I think we are on our fifth session yeah fifth five sessions we done within less than a week so we are really trying our best to walk you through the tools and help you to get to grips with them so that you can do something useful with it and that will help ease a lot of this learning",
  "it and that will help ease a lot of this learning burden in the beginning because once you get over that then reading the documentation becomes easier once you understand the basic how to get the tool so what is the tool to create the API oh it's a fast API we were talking about and we will demonstrate that today okay there are no other questions then oh there's Mana has got a question yes Mana yeah hi uh would it be possible for you to quickly revise the last sessions as well because I think",
  "revise the last sessions as well because I think I've missed all the sessions and this is the first one so if you could quickly review okay so we okay so we have done recordings for them by the way uh they aailable on the YouTube playlist and um we have also given summaries for them if you go to the um not going to say portal but you go to the tools in data science um website there uh the last item on there is uh in fact I can probably share my screen real quick most of you probably know this",
  "screen real quick most of you probably know this but uh just for the sake of those who will be watching it later so so if you go if you go here to the bottom you might not have noticed this but uh we've got um we've got these um summaries that have been generated okay and we even talk about hello how these hello yes uh yes I have a doubt sir sir okay okay yeah sh I'm in the middle of uh just explaining something real quick let me finish then I'll okay take your doubt okay aome right so yeah so",
  "okay take your doubt okay aome right so yeah so there are these live sessions okay uh which we had we have already conducted and um then we have extracted the information and put the put up FAQs so these FAQs summarize what has happened in these live sessions so if you don't want to go through the two-hour live session then by just by looking at the f you'll get a sense of what was covered in them it's not com it's not very comprehensive but it's fairly decent I mean there are 20 questions in",
  "fairly decent I mean there are 20 questions in here you know did we answer 20 questions in two hours probably but there may be some little details in there that may be missed out by these iges but it's a fairly succinct summary of what these sessions were so make sure to go through these and uh even this was generated using AI right and we we teach I use the word Loosely we explain how it was done so that is something you will be able to use yourself in your you know in any work that you do how",
  "in your you know in any work that you do how you can use a video and get summarized versions of what's happening in them so that uh has been explained in these in this so that's with regards to the session so my advice is if you need a overarching summary um uh we'll try and fit one in not today though we because we want to cover other things today uh and uh so who was the sorry who was asking someone else had a doubt as well yes yes me sh yes go yes sir sir in the week two assignment when I'm",
  "yes sir sir in the week two assignment when I'm doing the fast API okay so in that case uh it's asking to sign up for the NG NG Rock something like tool like that okay so for that it's wanting the question number nine sir question nine yes this is the one I think uh yes so in in this case it's wanting some authentication tool from the RG NG Rock something uh from like the software okay so it's saying that after using three times it's uh it's saying that is limitation has expired so in that case",
  "that is limitation has expired so in that case what we going do okay so NG Rock we will talk about it um it is on the on our session notes for today as well uh but the limitation there is you can't run I think more than one so yeah no not more than one sir it's showing that uh maximum limit is up to three times okay yeah but you can only run one server or one tunnel so another another doubt is in another question that in GitHub section uh to make the first uh web page using the G GitHub okay I",
  "the first uh web page using the G GitHub okay I forgot the question so in that case when I'm using using the GitHub for using a first web page of mind so it's a talking about this question seven is it yes yes yes yes yes so in this case it's wanting some premium version means it's wanting some paid version so no no we will we will show you how to do it without requiring premium version the only time you might have an issue with premium version is if you're using Cod spaces and youve run out of",
  "if you're using Cod spaces and youve run out of the 125 hours limitation that they require that they have also we because of our student ID we have free access to GitHub yes um some students are able to use it I know some have not been able to use it so that we we have to basically just upload our student ID uh just uh but wait for the new one you you'll probably be getting the new ID soon and you use that yeah yeah end of Jan I think they will produce the is there are no other quick doubts",
  "produce the is there are no other quick doubts only quick ones okay because we want to get started yes sir only these two only okay what's $48 I'm not sure I understand Oh you mean uh the cost is it okay lit has a okay yes go ahead L yes sir I have only two small doubts okay sir like that we once check the score it shows like 9 out of 10 or 10 out of 10 are the final scores or will be evaluated afterwards after the submission yeah yeah what no no you don't get evaluated after the submission",
  "no you don't get evaluated after the submission whatever you last submitted that is your final score okay and one more in ga1 question number two sir they said only submit Json body not the headers but if I don't submit headers it shows an error okay like I have to submit hold the thing this one is it use just no question number question number two okay Jon question only right we have to like you mean nine no like in my G it's question number two sir this one u h okay okay ah yes yes this one",
  "sir this one u h okay okay ah yes yes this one only sir M it say don't submit headers but if we remove headers it shows an error like host not found error it will show up okay we I'll get back with you on this okay we'll uh we'll have a look towards the end of the session yeah sure sir okay thank you that that's a problem okay right any other quick question is UV sa like when when I'm running UV in WSL then then it is showing no issue but when I'm doing it on Windows uh my that I have like a",
  "I'm doing it on Windows uh my that I have like a anti something some Shield is there on my computer yeah yeah flagging it that do not run this but running on WSL yeah so here's another I mean it's up to you but um most of the web infrastructure that is around the world I don't know what percentage but it's a crazy percentage of maybe like 88% or something like that all of them run on Linux servers okay that's why all these tools uh the world is running on Open Source Hardware and software okay",
  "running on Open Source Hardware and software okay um sorry not Hardware but open source software and um Linux is a big part of that so all these tools uh uh powerful tools when you go out in Industry you is going to be bread bread and butter your bread and butter it's a part and parcel of life so our suggestion is all these tools have been that's why most of these tools run well in Linux because they've been designed with Linux in my not in Windows right they've been later been ported to",
  "Windows right they've been later been ported to Windows so there will be some issues with running them in Windows now I know that some of you will say okay how do we so yeah I have Windows why do we need Linux you know this is a question you may ask right but this is uh a ground truth okay uh if you are good at running things in Linux or using the CLI uh The Bash terminal you will get quite ahead of people who cannot uh manage that the um other thing I'm going to say is you can get Linux in",
  "thing I'm going to say is you can get Linux in Windows now it used to be a very difficult process before but Windows recognizes even they themselves use Linux serves you believe it or not for a lot of their infrastructure so it may shock you to know that but Microsoft themselves don't use Microsoft servers for everything because they realize the limitations of their own software okay they use Linux for a lot of their infrastructures um and so because they recognize the value of Linux they what",
  "they recognize the value of Linux they what they do is they have allowed a new system called WSL windows subsystem for it's easy to install only thing is you need at least like an 8GB of RAM on your computer uh to run it with some reasonable performance okay anything less than that it's not going to work at all or may work very poorly so that's the only downside okay but it's uh it's if you can definitely install WSL I think a session where hang on just a second yeah so um there are a lot of",
  "on just a second yeah so um there are a lot of resources online for that it's a very basic thing right okay so you may not actually spend the time to do that but um we you know if if time permits this a big if because there's a lot of other things to cover you may show it to you but if you can try and do it yourself get WSL on your system it's really worth it then all these tools right will just work out the box without any trouble at all okay and you will save yourself a lot of heart if you",
  "and you will save yourself a lot of heart if you try and do everything in Windows you're always going to run into some issue or the other some thing that doesn't work well or some some problem you may encounter and then you have to debug and find out why so that's my suggestion use Linux for all these tools uh on Windows it be through wso MacBook uh typically uh runs all the Linux tools out the box some few things you may have to use a a package manager called home BL uh but again almost",
  "manager called home BL uh but again almost everything because it's an Unix based operating system they run most of the uh Linux packages without an issue on the Mac as well right so without uh there's nothing else I'll uh jaraj will take over now and he will introduce you to a few Concepts and then I pop in the middle to explain some things if necessary okay oh hello am I audible okay correct the screen okay so I will start with the GitHub actions and what they are useful for so if I go to any",
  "and what they are useful for so if I go to any particular repository and there I can find the option to create some workflows so if I go if I just click on actions button then I can go here and then here if I just click over this button then I can create a new workflow right now this file is empty because I have to write some code uh okay but we there is some suggestion by the GitHub so this is something that we can even try it out with minimum structure they have provided us so here uh for",
  "structure they have provided us so here uh for this particular workflow they are giving a name it can be any name we can give it any name of our um so so we can even give it a name TDS for example and then what is this on this on so what is this what is use of GitHub actions so what GitHub action would would do uh let's say it triggers some actions based on some events let us say you push code to the uh remote G repository and then it need it will execute some set of steps before actually P",
  "will execute some set of steps before actually P pushing the code and and even you can have different kind of or else if you create a pull request then also some code would run so for example for this particular repository tdscore repo for so temporary repo for TDS project uh here I'm mentioning when it needs to run these steps so whenever you push to Main Branch then it should run this these steps which are listed under jobs or it it will run when you create a pool request to the main branch",
  "when you create a pool request to the main branch you can even mention different branches for example you can put Master over here or some other branches okay I will just remove it and now here we have workflow dispatch so the need of this workflow dispatches let us say you want to run some workflow manually so this This would run every time you make a push but you might need to run it manually so if you provide this particular option then you will be able to um run it manually and right over",
  "will be able to um run it manually and right over here we have some jobs and there can be more than one job and all of them they can run sequentially that is one after the other and then they can even run in parallel by default they would run in parallel but you can do some configuration some changes and then it will run in sequential mode so over here what we have we have a job so this is jobs and under jobs we have one job that is called build and this job what it would do it will first run",
  "and this job what it would do it will first run it would first run a open to machine and after running the open to machine these are the steps that it needs to do so what it will do it will create a uh GitHub workpace for the repository that you have so this checkout thing will do that and after that these are the commands that are there so this name can be again anything you can give it any name it doesn't have to be uh I can change it for example run a or run a one like in uh maybe instead of",
  "run a or run a one like in uh maybe instead of script I can make it command or something and then what exactly we are running this is the command that we are running and we are running it where we are running it in a open to machine so whenever you will push some code to Main Branch then it would what it would do it will create instance of open to and then what it will do it will execute these steps and within job if there are multiple jobs then it can even execute in parallel or sequential",
  "it can even execute in parallel or sequential mode okay so what this would do this will uh print hello world to the terminal you can say and then what is this used for um this is you you just instead of single line you are echoing two different lines so by echo echo is a command in bash which allows you to basically uh print something through terminal so for example if I if I just go over here and let us say I type hello and I say rck then it would just print it back to the terminal so this is",
  "just print it back to the terminal so this is what we are doing over here this is uh excuse me J yes then uh isn't the Syntax for the echo like in the GitHub wrong here you put in a double quotation mark inside the bash and it's not giving that here it's just Echo hello world there's no quotation marks here uh we'll try ring this script if it gives us some error then we'll try to change it okay but this is like the default from GitHub you did not create this you took the recommendation of",
  "not create this you took the recommendation of GitHub then I think even if you just remove this will it work yeah it works you don't have the syntax is that yeah thank you sorry thank you J okay and what this pipe would do it will basically run these different uh commands one after the other okay now what I will do I will just Commit This and whenever I uh push something to the main branch what it would do it will run this script right so now I will commit it and this within this particular",
  "I will commit it and this within this particular repo it have created a do GitHub folder and within it it have created workflows folder and in that it have created a blank. ml file so this extension should be either yml or it will be either yl okay so now I will go to actions and here uh it is this action have been completed so if I go here and this is successful and if I just see it this is just a warning I think I will just read it so this is how I can manually run some process and so it have",
  "I can manually run some process and so it have set up a job which operate uh which initializes a operating system and then it does the sequence of tasks and so this is where it have executed the first run command so there were I think two run command over there let me just make sure that there were two so I will just create a duplicate of it and so here we have these two steps so this is U this was one single step and then the this were this was another step all right so what it have done it",
  "another step all right so what it have done it have first checked out so it is this checking out is just like you create a workpace in GitHub and then you uh copy all code you can say and after doing this it initializes the repo and it fetches the repository that is part of this particular script and then it have this task which name run a on line command which is listed over here so we have run Echo hello world and it Echo it to terminal and then we have this task which Echo two lines to the",
  "we have this task which Echo two lines to the terminal and we can even see these code over here and which shell it was using and these information is also listed over here and then this is after so this is uh after this is post action this is after running these scripts I think this is to free up all the uh resources that it is using and then it cleans up all these uh containers that that it created to run the jobs so one thing that uh you might be interested in I'm not Hello am I audible yes",
  "be interested in I'm not Hello am I audible yes sir you are audible yes sir so one thing that's uh useful to recognize here is that um when these um GitHub actions are running okay it's actually spinning up some uh you could imagine to be some type of VM that's running in the background that's running these tasks okay and um these uh also take uh I think resources through through your code space allowance most likely the um actions that are being taken so just keep that in mind when you're",
  "being taken so just keep that in mind when you're using these GitHub actions uh of course for small scale things like this it is not going to use up too many resources it's not something typically a tedious student would have to worry about but when you're going large scale and you're looking at things that are going to be running for quite a bit of time then these actions do take up your code space allows of hours okay but normally it's not something that you should worry about one useful",
  "something that you should worry about one useful scenario you can think of so what's the whole idea behind this get have action and um um is something called cicd right so kind continuous uh um I forget what the I was but the integration and continuous deployment so let's say for example your company produces a lot of um um some small little U iot gadgets okay maybe they are temperature sensors um that you're using somewhere and uh they have been deployed in many many places and you realize",
  "been deployed in many many places and you realize that oh there is a there is a bug in this uh this uh item that you have created and you get your uh development team to fix the bug you want to push the bug in uh push the bug fix uh and you need to run some tasks okay it's not just about pushing the code right it's got to um compile run them send it to these devices so you can imagine there's a workflow out there that requires all these things to be done but something like a actions that are",
  "to be done but something like a actions that are done through um the cicd process right can automate all that for you so your time from when you find the bug fix the bug and you actually push it out to the devices that actually require it you know that time lag is dramatically reduced and the Mana was involved in it is dramatically reduced so that's the kind of scenario there where you might see the value in something like this okay and you can understand why it's useful in data science as well",
  "why it's useful in data science as well where you're pulling data from various places and you want to uh quickly integrate what you have found out into a workflow that gives you something to your Frontline staff so you know you can think of the scenario where there was covid and things of this sort data is coming in from different places and they trying to push things uh into some sort of workflow that will give Frontline staff some information that they need straight away so these sort of cicd",
  "they need straight away so these sort of cicd flows automate a lot of that and that's the the whole idea we uh so the concept is very simple and obviously J that any questions you have regarding this topic then can go to the next one if you don't have okay there's no questions yeah ja will continue the next excuse me so please excuse me uh yeah sir what is CD sir just Mr what is it so basically when you're pushing yeah oh okay so when whenever you push some code to your repository before ex",
  "you push some code to your repository before ex exactly pushing it it uh you might need to check few things so that uh some wrong cord doesn't get pushed and then some sometimes what happens you you might have connected this particular report to the deployment part and then you might need to do some checks before actually deploying it and in order to do those checks so whenever you push the code to M main branch then it runs some uh some steps of code and then it checks that this code can be",
  "of code and then it checks that this code can be pushed and then only that will get pushed this is one such use case of get actions so if I again go back here and if I go to actions page and right now I don't see anything uh below it but if I go to I think if I click over here and if I just go down here then I can get access to this documentation for GI of actions which explains about why they are useful and then if I go to this particular page then here we have got information about so there",
  "then here we have got information about so there is something called event that is you pull or you create some some you even if you for or you uh push or even you create some pull request or you create a issue then some Runners will execute some scripts and those things so these Runners they can execute based on if uh the events that happen on the um repository and they can even execute from some apis so this is one way from some external apis you can execute some uh some Runners and then you",
  "you can execute some uh some Runners and then you can even have some scheduled time Runners which executes at a particular time and then you can even manually execute some runner for example if I just click over here it will then manually execute the runner and I can even cancel it while it is running so I can cancel it okay so this is one example where so what happens these jobs they generally so by default they will run parall but then we can control their uh workf flow for example whenever",
  "control their uh workf flow for example whenever you push something then you first want to set up a project and then you want to buuel it and then you might want to test it so let us say there are some steps that needs to execute one after the other in that case you can just put this needs is needs and then you just put the name of the uh job that needs to be done before it so setup should be done before building and then a test should happen before uh so test should happen after building and",
  "uh so test should happen after building and here actually you can create uh you can connect to some uh postgress SQL database or something like that and we can even do complex stuff like we can deploy something to a uh okay so we have these whenever you push the code then it have some environment variables and then it creates some job that is required for de deploying the code to AWS and then it is specified in which environment you want to deploy and then these are the steps so it first gets",
  "and then these are the steps so it first gets the code into get a work space and then it uh you uses these credentials and these things and then these are this is to log in and then so basically what this script does it will uh get the image and then it will at the end it will deploy your application to AWS so these kind of tasks can be automated using GitHub workflows so anyone have any doubts okay and here if I just go here and then if I go here so this is one repository that is created and",
  "so this is one repository that is created and so what it does it will uh fetch it is its main task is to run particular uh command that allows you to fetch data on the daily basis from this particular API which have data related to the location of International Space Station for example at this particular time stamp it is located at these longitudes and latitude so it have one GitHub workflow and the name of the workflow is this and then it is a scheduled task and it should run at this",
  "it is a scheduled task and it should run at this particular time stamp so this Crown task what it does it defines at what time you want to run a particular task for example This would run at exactly 12 in the afternoon you can say and then even you can trigger it manually that's why we have put this particular thing over here and then how it works it will uh create a UB to service and then it allows you to write something to to the repository so over here we are uh doing some right operations",
  "over here we are uh doing some right operations on the some file that is part of repository and then here we just open the code in workpace and then here wey we are trying to install few things and then this is python code that sends a request to the uh URL which I which have which is responsible for getting the longitude and latitude and then what it would do it will write it out to a particular file and then it will just commit it so using GitHub workflows it you can run task at a scheduled",
  "workflows it you can run task at a scheduled at a specific time and then you can send some request and those things also can be done and this is where all the data is stored on different time stamps okay so anyone have doubt no sir so this deploying to versal have two different ways one is through you install but C and one thing will be very helpful JRA like yes like once I once I saw verel like I completely I'm like uh I don't know what it is used for how it can be used won't be any of like it",
  "for how it can be used won't be any of like it won't be of any help for me so what it is exactly where it will be used then we can discuss it later how the things will be going I don't have any clue where it is getting used what is the sole purpose of this so very very very useful just I'm user ofel but yeah it is very very useful and now probably can tell you you can feel free to volunteer go ahead and explain to your perspective why it's useful because you're use use case for it right so go",
  "because you're use use case for it right so go ahead you can talk about [Music] verel hello so to go for minutes is basically you know they are also the creators of next you can deploy any app if you have I'll show you one app which I have deployed it was for a but yeah so it's like you can deploy apps very quickly you not really have to even just you can go back to the meeting and open the link actually shared a link in the chat box this is like app which I built so you can literally build any",
  "app which I built so you can literally build any app and then push to basically push to your GitHub and it automatically deploys it H is it for Mad one project or something no no this was just for Google aaton okay I'm just using the open source mod so there is no cost to it it's like I'm hosting this website for free on WhatsApp anybody can push to GitHub link it toel and weite you can see it's a.w. so you can literally deploy ffled applications as well now figured out exactly how to connect",
  "as well now figured out exactly how to connect for rest API right there's supposed to be Ser functions for connecting to data I not fig that part out well now but have full applications here so even even the login is actually working here but Lo a part I just buil custom okay so the use of verel is to deploy some application that you have created if it is running on your system then you would like to deployed somewhere on cloud and then it can be accessed by others so right now what I'm trying",
  "accessed by others so right now what I'm trying to do I'm trying to use CLI and then I will try to deploy some deploy a particular verel so a particular python application so this is fun way to download versal CLI using npm and then there are other is you can download it using gar and then this is one more package manager which I don't know about but these are three different ways you can download it and then if that it already exist on your system then you can even uh update it so now what I",
  "then you can even uh update it so now what I will do I have already downloaded it and even I have uh I have set it up by set setting it up I mean I have authenticated it by logining in so now I what I will do I will create a test 20 or some folder and within this folder what I will do I will create another folder which have API let's name it API and in this folder I will create one more file that is index. pi and this index. Pi will have this piece of code so basically what it is doing it is uh",
  "of code so basically what it is doing it is uh handling a get request and then these are the so in in the response it is sending 200 as the Response Code so there are multiple Response Code for example 404 for P not found in these things and then in headers it is also sending that data will come in Json format and then here it ends the header and then this is actual content that gets sent and now I what I will do I have this web page which which which is just a Blog to how you can uh host a",
  "which is just a Blog to how you can uh host a python application to verell so this is the uh verel CLA downloading part and then this is for logining in which we have already done so now I will just copy paste this uh thing to here and I will call package do Jason so this particular file tells which version uh should be used and then this is about mean and then uh these are two commands if you do versal Dev and then this is versal this is basically to start on your local machine and then this",
  "to start on your local machine and then this is to deploy it so I think all the setup is done now what I will do I will use npm start I'm running it from the wrong folder I will have to go to testore 20 and then I will do npms start this would execute this particular command which is versal hyphen Dev even I can just execute it manually and then it will ask if you want to depl develop yes no and name of the project can be TDS 21 01 yes no uh this might be because of the name of the project I",
  "might be because of the name of the project I think I'm not allowed to use this backlash so I will just remove that DDS 21 gen and yes project name can be up to 100 character long and must be lower case they include letters digit and these things Capital TDS so it has to be yes yeah the name should be entirely in cursive letters okay it should be all the lower letters c and TDS and let me call it 21 gen I think now it would work okay it have given me this particular end point and it's is there",
  "me this particular end point and it's is there is nothing in here here because this AP and if I go to so this is a structure of folder it have veral file and then it have this API folder which have index. Pi so now what I will do I will go to API endpoint and it gets this message hello and this is a Json object which it returns because over here we have stated that the output the response would be in Json format and here we are even converting it to Json so basically if you create multiple",
  "it to Json so basically if you create multiple folder under this thing uh here it is API and then let us say it is some other folder and then if you have some other code and um that that do does something else then you will have to just go to other URL and then you can have access to whatever is there so there are four different ways four or five different methods one is this get and then other is post so you can instead of do get if you do do Post then here you will what it will do it will get",
  "then here you will what it will do it will get it will allow you to send the post request to this particular URL but right now it is running on my local machine what I will do I will now push it to versel so the way to push it to is either I can use npm space deploy or I can just copy this command and I can just paste it here this building part would take a little bit of time and once it builds we can go to verell and here I will just go to dashboard where I can see the name of the project",
  "dashboard where I can see the name of the project which is TDS 21 gen if I just go click over here and then I just go here and now if I just go to API it gets me the same message and I read a post on discourse which talks about fail to fetch error so whenever you submit a versal URL over here it fails to submit so the solution to that is you would have to add codes over here so I already added codes to some other application I would just copy paste it from there so if you add this line to your",
  "it from there so if you add this line to your code then it would allow to it will it will allow to uh send response back to the request that comes from some other server so that is all that is there is there any doubt on this part okay if no more doubt then Calton would take over and he will explain how you can just do it using by just connecting it to a GitHub repository and then pull the code from a GitHub repository and deploy it to versel so JRA has just U shown you uh how you deploy versal",
  "JRA has just U shown you uh how you deploy versal you develop your application on the system and then you uh uh do your testing bya deploying the versal package from your system and then eventually putting it into production envirment so that's one way to do uh before you start I would like to show how they can access logs yeah yeah that would be so if you go over here and then here it shows you the information about where it is deployed the domain and then you can even have a look at the",
  "domain and then you can even have a look at the source code so these are the different folder ERS that I created on my local system so this was that file and now if I go to logs so whenever some request comes to the server then it so all these things have to be written on vs code and from there it will get to deploy it like that you can use any editor you can even use text I I I I know only two or three editors else there is an extension on like the scripting of powerbi except that I haven't",
  "the scripting of powerbi except that I haven't used any uh yes you can do all of this on vs c v so all you have to do you you would have to install versal CLI and then you can start working with it and whenever you uh send any request on this particular server let us say I hit it again then all that information cap get gets captured here so the time and those things will get captured here and if there was some error then it would appear here and then you can even uh log it so if some error",
  "and then you can even uh log it so if some error comes at the run time then you can write some meaningful logs manually so it have the time when it came and then the status and where it was hosted on this particular URL it was hosted and then it was requested at this particular end point and then there is this message as well so if some error come if there is some error with your application so this is the place where you can look for the errors and then you can fix them and then you can deploy",
  "and then you can fix them and then you can deploy it back okay yeah so um that's the uh normal way how versal gets deployed but if you wanted to just do the quick and dirty right um which is doesn't involve any of that all you have to do is in your versal dashboard you just go to add new F project and then uh you search for the uh uh GitHub repo where it is located okay so in this case like if it was uh here then you would select that and give give the actual uh name then you search up the the",
  "the actual uh name then you search up the the actual repo that you want to connect to your versel application and say import and then it just builds it and it gets ready and that's all you have to do it's basically a two-step process if you do it uh by the web website it does all the things the configuration um what you how say it automagically as as I would like to say it right and that's generally for your G and all you can do it that way you don't have to install versal uh on your local",
  "you don't have to install versal uh on your local environment you don't have to uh configure it uh using the configuration scripts uh but they are very easy it's not that it's difficult but if you want to avoid doing all that all you need is a repo that has the correct code for running the U handling the end points like in the case of G2 sole I think it was here this one so yeah so if you for example put this code into your GitHub repo right at this location API and um then rather than using",
  "this location API and um then rather than using the CLI all you did was select it over here from wordell and ran that repo then what would happen is immediately it'll give you a link and you can straight away then use the uh use the uh end point that it gives you and your application immediately starts running so there isn't all these uh things these lot small little details that you don't have to worry about it and uh that's just a quick and easy way to do it I was trying to delete this so",
  "easy way to do it I was trying to delete this so that you could have a look at it but I was having some difficulty actually trying to delete it so that's why I'm not able to show you the the exact process and the step but it's it's it's just really as simple as that you say add new project get the repo that you're looking for and then it does the build process that you saw that was happening in the vs code you know on the terminal it was doing all that it'll just do it over here and when it's",
  "all that it'll just do it over here and when it's ready to go it just you can just use the the link that you get over here that is these links over here and then you can just run the application the same way and you don't have to do any configuration and works straight out the box okay takes like literally I think it took me all of 10 minutes to do this the 10 minutes is not because it um was not because it uh I was trying to fix something it was because I was just trying to get to grips with",
  "because I was just trying to get to grips with the site itself but now that I know the process this will take me less than a minute if I have got the code ready right it'll take less than a minute to connect the repo with the versel and get an end point you don't have to worry about the build configuration or anything of that sort okay and here's one more beautiful thing let's say you push an update on GitHub right you don't even have to rebuild it versel automatically as soon as you push an",
  "it versel automatically as soon as you push an update yes vers automatically reveals the end point and it's ready to go again so none of the things that JB showed you you have to do it just automatically does it so you know when you ask what's the use case of it right I think that's a pretty strong argument for using the speed at which you can deploy is literally minutes when you push an update it's rebuilt the project is rebuilt and ready again in minutes so and it's done everything is done",
  "in minutes so and it's done everything is done automatically completely automatically and you can even do things like roll back so you can go back so you deployed something and then it failed out in the real world and you want to roll back there's instant so do we have to have a specific name for the app or we can like do anything yeah you can do anything because um the the key part of the app is see like even for this uh GitHub if I show you if I go to it and and and should we keep the repo",
  "if I go to it and and and should we keep the repo public or private so this repo I kept as public if you're putting it private then there are some probably some permissions that you will have to give it uh some sort of open permissions in so this is just I put kept it as public but all I did was the same thing just keep the keep the file in here uh and it can be called anything it doesn't have to be called index it can be you can name it anything as long as it has an endpoint that's working in",
  "as long as it has an endpoint that's working in there right it will uh it will respond to the endpoint uh as long as you're handling the endpoint correctly and that's it that's all you have to do push the code ver automatically builds it and it's ready to go that's how seamless and quick it is that is yeah it was it's fantastic I mean even jrj was quite surprised when I told him then he was explaining to me all this uh deployment uh scripts and then I said you know you could do this in like",
  "then I said you know you could do this in like just a couple of minutes like and he was like what it was was quite funny but yeah this is this is it you should try it it just try you use I built with verel but I have not dealt with apis before like I've I've done little bit but not connected with the proper database I'll try doing yeah so just try doing that you know have something that responds U that so this is a functional way of doing it okay your each endpoint is basically a function",
  "okay your each endpoint is basically a function that's running as you can see there's no uh run main or any fancy libraries being loaded for running like a flask application or anything you're just handling the endpoint that's all you're doing that's all your little file does over there and as soon as it hits the end point it uh then what you do is with versal you just connected to your GitHub it builds everything and then gives you the end point and it's ready that's it so please excuse me uh",
  "and it's ready that's it so please excuse me uh you seem to use uh the the word endpoint quite often sir what does it mean it's a technical term uh okay so end point when say endpoint so this uh if you look at this um the browser URL right yeah so this is the domain what we call the domain of the this is where the server's main entry point is okay and endpoint so the server will have many uh pages that connect to it okay so when I say endpoint it is each endpoint is like a function that the web",
  "is each endpoint is like a function that the web server is doing right one function is it's probably showing you uh the login page one function it's doing is probably uh fetching you some search results another function it is doing is probably it is um writing something to the server so we call these end points because they change right each end point is a different so yeah it's a technical word I see but it just basically means running that particular page uh from the server fetching that page",
  "page uh from the server fetching that page from the server or running a function associated with that page so these are like calling them right in that sense can you say as an Internet site sir no yeah yeah so yeah so it's the Internet site itself will be like this ver.com or github.com but the uh the bits that come after it right that produce the effect you want right okay that is an end point you know that is uh what I would call an end point does that make sense so that's what and this is",
  "does that make sense so that's what and this is different from apaa no excuse me uh it's it's a so in apis okay they're also a type of endpoint only okay it's um some people uh when when they say Endo they think they're talking about web pages they think about web pages uh with um uh with apis u you Call uh I forget what the technical terms for apis generally they are all some sort of endpoint because that's the last bit that calls the function right so okay sir that's how I best I can explain",
  "right so okay sir that's how I best I can explain it um there may be some slight nuances between a web page and an endpoint but uh from a coding perspective they kind of the same uh the only difference is apis tend to give you Json okay but uh you may actually fetch a whole page instead right an interactive page or something an API almost invariably always is by by convention gives you a Json response P so that's I suppose one difference between an API and an end point if you want to think of",
  "an API and an end point if you want to think of it that way okay thank you sir right um what's next on the agenda do okay yeah soaj will talk to you about talk but before he de does a technical demonstration I'll um just explain a little bit about why Docker okay Colton so I have pasted two links which have information about how you can deploy a flask application which is similar to how you can create a fast API application and then you can deploy it to worel so if anyone of you want to try byy",
  "it to worel so if anyone of you want to try byy attaching some database and then creating a full application using flask or fast API then you can uh have a look at the first URL okay sir excuse me once again explain me sir please the two links what do they indicate wait a second uh is my screen visible so what I was talking about if I if I just go to this particular page so it have information about how you can create a flask application so this is about installing verel CLI and then this is",
  "is about installing verel CLI and then this is installing some packages that is required for creating a application and then this is the actual code index. pi and then these are if you follow these exact steps and then you can actually deploy a flask application to versel so this is something that needs to be inside verel dojon it actually runs no additional cost or anything uh additional cost in the sense it runs a proper like uh in the local mad one right we were having this flask back end",
  "mad one right we were having this flask back end for the for interacting with the database with the SQL database so this this entire API thing will run on on on verell itself and then we can kind of interact with the in a separate uh uh versal instance we we can kind of interact like we were doing it in a local environment with the flask backend rate well the thing is if you are including databases into the equation then it will inquire it will need some additional charges so like you have to",
  "need some additional charges so like you have to purchase an entire VPS which is a virtual private server and it will be constantly running for your application and uh whenever you're trying to fetch the data using an API which is indeed then fetching it from a database so that will require some additional cost and that's where the WPS will come so yeah it will on verel or on the database side on the database actually actually you can have a database you can have a database somewhere on cloud",
  "you can have a database somewhere on cloud and then the same way you used to connect it to a local database that is some sqlite file in your mad 2 Project mad one project or mad 2 project the same what you can do you can connect it to some database that is hosted on cloud and those connections you can put here the actually the thing is that whenever you are using databases and you are then fetching the data using an API call so uh if that API is like it's being served on like a public platform",
  "like it's being served on like a public platform like for instance there is n min te and there there is BBC weather API as well so if you are using those kind of those kinds of applications so then there won't be any extra charges so you can just simply extract the data and like they but yeah I'm not deating too much but uh this is fine right uh here where we are we are connecting locally we can connect to the cloud connecting to the cloud uh all right mongod or anything right mongod DB then",
  "all right mongod or anything right mongod DB then that should have been like it should be served somewhere so there is there should be a WPS sorry there should be a VPS running uh somewhere in the world which is serving that particular database that mongodb database or sq database so like if it's publicly available then you need not maybe maybe maybe later later J or maybe you can share something uh more on this but uh maybe you can continue with the class but this is like really interesting I",
  "the class but this is like really interesting I want to learn more about this uh JJ if we have time I can show this flask part as well we can show it at the end right now let's stick to the yeah okay otherwise we can have an entire like uh we can do this in uh another live session as well because you know I have to prepare some material for this and uh then we can perhaps show an entire tutorial how you can set up a flask application and then deploy it yeah like connecting to database and all",
  "it yeah like connecting to database and all those stuff you can do yeah exactly I can like yeah I can show them how you can exact you can create an API and then you can create you you can like fetch data from a database using flask and then how you can deploy it uh from your local machine and then you can uh how you can access those AP input so so we can have that in another live session we can goe with the content you guys have prepared all right okay so uh let's see I can get this up and",
  "right okay so uh let's see I can get this up and running okay so um so one question is um you know what what exactly is Docker okay um we've shown you how to use serverless functions and all these sorts of things uh and where where does this uh where does this technology fit okay because I know that one of you have asked that question before right show me the show me the reason why and then then show me how right so uh so before I can talk about doer I can I'll talk about what came before",
  "about doer I can I'll talk about what came before Docker before Docker there was something called virtual machine okay and U this concept uh the idea behind it was um if you've got uh let's say for example you've got a physical uh server okay and this physical server you know it has so much resources it's got so much RAM um you know it's got uh this kind of processor it's got uh a lot of hard disk space or something like that okay and you're running some service of this uh some kind of service",
  "some service of this uh some kind of service you're running from this server and it only takes up a a small portion of the resources on your system um and sometimes it may take more but uh most of the time when it's running you know it's uh if you think of a think of it like traffic management there are sometimes when there's lot of usage and sometimes there's very little usage so the same road which holds uh a th cars may only have 10 cars running on it at midnight whereas it during rusher may",
  "on it at midnight whereas it during rusher may be completely clogged up right so um the problem is how do we um make good use of these remaining resources that are there right um and then the second problem that you had was uh This Server okay that was running these Services um if something happened to the operating system right to the Kel if there was a eral error that occurred because some application was misbehaving in it then youve lost this entire server okay and then restarting it fixing",
  "entire server okay and then restarting it fixing whatever the issue was uh these are all very U timec consuming things so you're offline for a long time and in big business you know every minute that you're offline is costing you uh literally lacks of rupees or cores of rupees okay so the solution to that was okay well let's create what are called virtual machines okay so virtual machine basically does uh this task which is inside your physical machine you actually have several smaller uh",
  "machine you actually have several smaller uh representations of a physical machine so whereas before you you know you might have one big processor that has say 20 CES now in a virtual machine you will have assigned two for that two for that maybe four for this Etc okay and each one of these little machines these virtual machines they're not real they exist as uh uh in software only uh what they do is they pretend that it's a complete system so you will have a its own deployment of an operating",
  "will have a its own deployment of an operating system each of these will have its own kernel okay each of them uh when you connect to them from the outside world you can't tell the difference between whether it's a virtual machine or a real machine machine okay so these act as a proxy of a real machine you know in that sense um but what it is it's one very powerful machine running lots of small little machines in there so now the advantage is you're using the resource more effectively because",
  "using the resource more effectively because you as you need more virtual machines to spin up uh you can just spin them up okay and as you don't require the resource you can spin them off or turn them off and it gives you some yeah it is like kws instances uh that's uh cloud computing is the same concept but on a very large scale and um the other advantage of doing it this way is let's say some misbehaving application inside this virtual machine right uh causes this kernel to create an error",
  "right uh causes this kernel to create an error okay then only this server is lost but guess what all these other services are still running so that's the idea behind a virtual machine okay they uh they can and the other beautiful thing is you can bring this back online very quickly because why you have a copy sitting of a good copy of it sitting somewhere where you can fetch it again so you know that this failed so all you have to do is fetch a fresh copy of this and it runs okay I'll get to",
  "a fresh copy of this and it runs okay I'll get to that Z in just a second so this is the concept behind a virtual machine but there is also a downside to this virtual machine if you think about it right uh think about it in your laptop context okay your laptop has Windows on it okay most likely and um it will take some resources so much RAM it will take so much hard disk space it will take all these things it will take right uh but when you're running a virtual machine you'll again make another",
  "a virtual machine you'll again make another copy effectively of Windows that also will take so much RAM so much space and yes although your machine is very powerful uh you know in a normal laptop you may be able to perhaps if if it's a good one you may be able to pull up three or four virtual machines and they're very resource intensive because they basically a copy of your actual system that's what they are you're running full-fledged fully functional copies of your uh system now this uh also",
  "copies of your uh system now this uh also gives you one more advantage this isolation from each other okay is gives you a lot more security as well okay but the downside is it takes a lot of resources but for a long time this was the way it used to be done at data centers they used to run lots of these virtual machines and even today it is widely used so what is doer then okay so the the New Concept was instead of making an entire copy of uh of a virtual machine with its own kernel with its own",
  "virtual machine with its own kernel with its own name space uh and all the resources that it requires instead of doing that why don't we instead have a single kernel okay so here's the kernel and um you segregate some spaces for it okay to run an application and you provide a virtualized uh instance of uh the same things the same functionality you expect in a so and the same um virtualize the file system that's available so file system on your computer right there there'll be a directory",
  "your computer right there there'll be a directory there'll be a root directory there'll be some other things like home and things like that right so what uh what a what do will do is it'll keep the kernel the same but using some clever pointers right it will give you some visualized instances of a file system okay and make you think that you're running a full-fledged system but you're not you're running uh effectively what's called a container which is much smaller than a virtual machine so to",
  "is much smaller than a virtual machine so to give you the difference this makes right um the in a in a machine that could only do perhaps three or four virtual machines right you can easily probably push push out something like over 100 Docker containers right or maybe even maybe even thousand Docker containers um now uh the next question becomes right so why do we need these Docker containers so think of yourself as a someone who's writing an application okay when you write your application",
  "application okay when you write your application now some of you have done mad project and you'll know your application will have some uh specific requirements will be there it will require a certain version of python right so uh let's say for example it ran on 3.12 and when you were designing the application the dependencies also will have specific versions of uh things that are deed and it was specifically running on a particular type of Linux machine maybe okay uh so all these dependencies",
  "machine maybe okay uh so all these dependencies are Interlink with each other and when you deployed it it worked great okay no uh there were no problems with it and all that now to create recreate this this environment that it's running in right um it's difficult to um if you just gave the code to someone right and say okay this is the this is the code now uh run this right it's difficult for them to recreate this exact setup you may be able to give them the requirements file you may be able to",
  "them the requirements file you may be able to give them a lot of things but even the hardware right the underlying Hardware the representation of a hardware all these things will there will be some minor differences and sometimes that causes applications to fail uh and how do we reduce the differences between uh something that's that works on your machine versus something that's out there that is being deployed somewhere how do you reduce these these differences right and this is where the",
  "these differences right and this is where the concept of uh packaging both the application sorry both the application and its environment okay its runtime environment and that includes all its dependencies what kind of os it might have been running on all these sorts of things okay only representations of them okay it's not we're not going to mimic the whole thing but um let's say for example your application requires a function okay say it requires a datetime function or something now this",
  "a datetime function or something now this datetime function actually comes from the OS okay um this is a trivial example but uh this is this is to help illustrate the point when we are packaging it in a Docker container what we are saying is yes there is a datetime function available okay there's a daytime function available but we are not actually providing all the resources that are required to uh mimic this instead it's just a little pointer somewhere to the colel to run this run this call",
  "somewhere to the colel to run this run this call then it comes whereas in a VM you will have lots of uh background processes that are constantly running and each VM will have its own instance of a background process whereas in this situation you won't have that okay so you can see from a business perspective if you give the option for someone to run 100 servers versus four servers on the same uh Hardware of course you will go with 100 servers right because you're just able to leverage a lot",
  "right because you're just able to leverage a lot more from it uh so if it's so wonderful what is the downside so there is a downside and that is the fact that um this um separation is not as clean as this picture makes it out to be okay now many people will try to say we can achieve good security and compartmentalization is the word they use for it you can achieve that but in reality many security researchers have shown that this this uh kind of virtualization does not uh achieve the same type",
  "virtualization does not uh achieve the same type of security framework that fully virtual machine will do uh then the second thing problem is if you're somehow able to break out of this container and uh impact the kernel here right guess what all these other guys also die along with your Docker container so if this Kel gets compromised then then it's game over okay so that's the downside but you have it depends on the scenario your business is operating right there are good use cases to have",
  "operating right there are good use cases to have Docker containers um but then some very critical systems you will not run in a do container right you'll probably run it in a VM full-fledged VM so depending on your use case how critical it is to your business you will make a decision on what tradeoffs to make so that is where Docker comes so for most people who are just like data scientists are a good example we just have some simple applications that do some move some data from one point to",
  "that do some move some data from one point to another do some Transformations and um provide a service right for those kinds of things Docker is fantastic you know we can have spin up these Docker containers that will run all these um most banks are also moving toward talk uh it depends what application you're specifically talking about they will may be using moving some specific functions to doer but they not move the critical entire critical system into a Docker that if a bank did then I'm",
  "system into a Docker that if a bank did then I'm going to not keep my money that bank okay uh but yeah um so that's what Docker is I hope that gives you an understanding of the reason why and what does do and kubernetes have the same functionality so kubernetes is an orchestration software what I mean by that is so a Docker container by itself it's just a an application packaged with its runtime requirements right uh but sometimes you want an army of Docker containers to achieve a greater",
  "an army of Docker containers to achieve a greater purpose so for example this one might be a web server okay this one might be a database uh some sort of ephemeral database okay not a not a persistent database so you may have a doct container for that okay and then you may have another uh one that represents some sort of um log system or something you know it could be any number of things or not a log system sorry let's say it's a doing the work of a name server namespace server or something",
  "of a name server namespace server or something like that another one might be credentials something like this okay so if it's got these kind of all these services in there and um one of these so all these are critical for your entire system to work all of them work to together to deliver your actual production outcome so one of these let's say one of these fail right so something like an orchestration software will immediately without human input recognize that a failure has occurred",
  "human input recognize that a failure has occurred immediately fetch spin up another one and this is the kind of thing orchestration softwares do okay they they orchestrate these Docker containers to work together the and these Docker containers also get connected connected to each other uh just like normal networks do they will have an IP address as if they are real physical machines and these IP addresses will be U used to connect each other to communicate as if they're communicating via tcpip",
  "communicate as if they're communicating via tcpip uh so they will have a network stack in them so all these things will uh be there so the orchestration S like kubernetes they will uh just if you've seen an orchestra there are many musical instruments many people playing various instruments but together they produce a beautiful music so that's what orchestration software does it uh it's like the conductor who stands in the front and he's orchestrating the the whole process so that's how that",
  "the the whole process so that's how that works okay so that's a broad overview of talker and the use case for it and um it's very easy to use very simple to use um and in fact doer will be used in your project I believe so it's good to learn how it works and so R will give you technical demonstration of that okay you sol in this session yeah har we'll have a look at that at the end okay you can share your screen as well okay uh Hara like just do SL API and you will be sorted uh hi so pman and",
  "SL API and you will be sorted uh hi so pman and Docker both of them the these tools they work in a similar fashion they allows you to create a machine and within that machine you can create multiple um containers so I have already installed podman so I will be using that I think I have pman installed okay so we have something called Docker Hub I just one thing like creating lockers on our system won't affect our system any in any way right yeah so that's the other beautiful thing about",
  "yeah so that's the other beautiful thing about containers is that they don't actually affect your system so that's like the envirment we creating yeah nice but it's not full virtual uh virtualization okay just remember that so if you're running something that's suspect a VM will be much more robust than do so this this is the platform where you can sign in and then you can deploy some virtual you can deploy your do image and you can even download the docker images which are already being",
  "the docker images which are already being deployed by somebody else so for example I think I have deployed one image sometime in past so if it can I it's after a lot okay I haven't deployed any maybe I have removed it I don't remember from home okay when you log in you you see the screen yes are you using are you using shell scripting like you're writing codes in your terminal so you are using this this to check whether there is an uh instance of this Docker like anything which you have",
  "of this Docker like anything which you have downloaded on your local machine is that is if I'm getting that thing correct no right now I what I doing I'm just showing you this is the platform where you can uh push your Docker image it works the same way way as GitHub works so on GitHub you can push somewh repository the same way you can push your Docker images over here and then those images can be pulled from Docker Hub and you can even search for the images through the command line tool so",
  "for the images through the command line tool so for example this uh podman we have if I do pman is when we publish it right or something or does it automatically take all uh can you uh repeat what did you say last I got confused that publishes or this do image actually whenever you create a g repo right once you have code ready with you you can actually commit it and then you can push it to the GitHub right the same way you can push a image that you have created to Docker hub okay okay so this",
  "you have created to Docker hub okay okay so this pman search what it allows you to do it allows you to actually look for all the uh images that match something for example let us say if there is some uh image that is created for running open to on your inside a particular container then what you can do you can search for those images I do pman search and then I think I will just need to mention open over here C is like you are searching for pman and then you are like writing the OS of your",
  "pman and then you are like writing the OS of your laptop or how so how it works for example if there is some uh let us say if I search over here open 2 and here I can have a look at different uh different images that that's been pushed by somebody on Docker Hub and if I look for all the images if I just filter out and then all the images that are official there is no result writing UB but no u bu u n okay okay so whatever you are calling uh here images are different instances uh yes so what",
  "images are different instances uh yes so what what happens whenever you use podman search and then you just type something over here what it does it actually search on internet and it gets you the same result as we are getting here so here I'm getting this open to uh which is a operating system that we can run inside a particular uh inside a container so now what I will do I will just pull this image to my local system actually I don't know for what reason this vman search is not working",
  "for what reason this vman search is not working ideally what it should have done it should have fetched some results like this and you can even see all these all these um uh sorry for Interruption U while binding it to what we are me meant to do like in that respect how we will be using this do we need to install like uh on our on our system and then from there whatever we are whatever apps we are making then we will push it to this like uh actually what what I'm trying to do I have just",
  "actually what what I'm trying to do I have just installed podman CLI and then what I am trying to do I have searched for all the images of UB 2 so this is one such image that is created by someone and it is basically official image so if I just check mark this then it it will get all these official images of open so this is the one that that have offici tag over here and then if I just copy this uh command and instead of Docker if I use pod manman then it it is trying to pull this particular",
  "then it it is trying to pull this particular image from Docker I okay and it have already from there here onwards like what will happen once you will do this and then after that like how that how things will flow after okay so now that I have pulled it to on my system I I will just look for all the images that are already on my system so this is the image that I have just uh fetched which was created two uh months ago so if you notice something okay look how big this image is is okay it's only",
  "okay look how big this image is is okay it's only 80 megab bck whereas if you look at uh an Ubuntu system an Ubuntu system typically will run you probably around 2 gigabytes or so in size plus uh some extra space will be required for some other things as well whereas this entire Ubuntu system has been represented by 80 meaps so how does it achieve it because it doesn't actually contain ob2 instead it contains a representation of it okay so if you think of the entire Ubuntu file system right so",
  "think of the entire Ubuntu file system right so this is the this is the clever bit about it it only the docker image only contains the pointers to the files that your application wants to refer to so let's say your application wants to run a command Like A bash command or a datetime command or LS command or any Command right inside that image it has a representation of Ubuntu not Ubuntu itself and that's what makes it so clever okay and um then what happens is that the the application that runs",
  "happens is that the the application that runs the docker image that will be the virtual instance and so like this you will have hundreds of representations all encapsulated one after the other and that's why you can spin them up and it will all run on the same uh kernel that uh makes the that intercepts the calls okay so I hope that was clear I'm not sure if you you understood what I said but uh I hope that gives you some insight into why this is such a fantastic thing oh that uh that's that",
  "is such a fantastic thing oh that uh that's that that's there thanks for the explanation content so what I was selling is U with respect to the course which we are doing uh in terms of that in the limited scope how we will be using this one like is there a like quick reference um quick reference in the sense there are some basic commands if you learn then that should be sufficient for you to be able to learn how to use it now one thing j is probably going to demonstrate I haven't checked with",
  "going to demonstrate I haven't checked with him but he will spin up this Ubunto okay and for all intentions and purposes when he spins it up you can connect to it as if it were a real machine he will I think he will SSH into it or use an interactive ter terminal you can either SSH as if it was a real machine or you can even use what's called interactive terminal he show that to you and while you're inside there it'll behave as it as if it was a real UB except it it isn't okay so he'll he'll go",
  "real UB except it it isn't okay so he'll he'll go ahead and demonstrate that to you but what will happen is when you're creating your application so imagine you're creating some python file or a script or some program that you want it to run and you only want that application to run on them you don't want anything else to run on it so it has all its uh dependencies it has its entire Ubuntu set the versions are all correct and now you even 20 years from now assuming the docker is still around 20",
  "from now assuming the docker is still around 20 years from now someone can still take that image run it on a modern machine right that maybe a Quantum machine or something I don't know but it will still work why because that's what it has it has all the things that it requires is self contained within that small image that you see and how it gets implemented it doesn't care about that is down to whatever is implementing those function calls that are coming out of the doer image so that's the",
  "are coming out of the doer image so that's the concept behind it so it's replicable anywhere in the world whichever machine you want to run it whe it's Windows or Mac OS Linux some new fanged OS that comes out I don't know you know so it can run on anything what is the difference between do and Docker compos sorry Docker what what is the difference between Docker run and Docker compos um so there are two different commands that achieve two different things right do compose I think uh you're you",
  "things right do compose I think uh you're you you have to give some configuration files for dock compose and you give it um I'll have to I'll have to cut back with you on that because I myself I'm not uh sure of what I I was seeing an application which was which is a cloud-based application but they were saying on their support page that if you want to try our app locally you can you can use Docker and I was clueless in terms of how to use that but they had given two options Docker and Docker",
  "but they had given two options Docker and Docker compost so that is why I asked Docker compost is a local thing actually like which you can use it to test uh it'll create a local uh Network you can create your own uh network name you can give it and then it'll create it it'll test with four or five containers if you want better one you can use swarm swarm is provided by Docker itself um but if you want even more better then better use kubernetes or misos literally starting out with do but thank",
  "or misos literally starting out with do but thank you for the information yeah thanks thanks L who was that sorry my name is Hara ah Hara thanks Hara that was that was great great explanation thanks so now that we have pulled this particular image now what I would do I will just run this image inside the container so I will use I will just run this image so the way to run is you use pman run and then you put the image ID and now I want to run it in interactive shell and I also want the terminal",
  "in interactive shell and I also want the terminal I think this needs to go before this okay so now what I have done I have run this particular image inside a b script so right now I have access to a open to machine and that machine comes from this IM this particular image which is running inside a container and when we try to execute some python script or some S command so for example let us say if I use VI so there is a Vim editor which comes uh with open to so it is not present right now and",
  "with open to so it is not present right now and if I try to run some P python script so this command is also not present over here so with this image that I have downloaded I don't have access to everything so if I download a virtual uh a virtual machine or WSL I will have more things that is already installed but over here I can even install think so if I use AP install and then if I use Python 3 I think that that would install python on doer uh this this particular image but for some reason",
  "uh this this particular image but for some reason it's not working so I will just take help from J Chi uh what is the way to install you're missing the repository name [Music] Pon within doer container and let's try this out let me first update it so it this machine is connected to Internet that's why it is able to uh upgrade all these packages now what I will do I will just copy this line and this would install python to my system so I will have to select the geographical location so I will",
  "to select the geographical location so I will select Asia which is on the fifth place so I have typed five over here and then time John can be Karachi maybe Kolkata that is 44 and now I have installed python to this container which is running open to so now if I just do something let us say 1+ 2 it will print print three which is expected Behavior this way we can install anything on this particular uh open to machine which is running inside the container and when I have done everything that is",
  "container and when I have done everything that is required then I can just exit out of it and once I exit out of it and again list all the uh so if I just list all the processes that are currently running so this is showing me this particular container was created 3 minutes ago and now I have just exited out of this particular container which have this ID over here and what I have done in that container I have basically installed Python and this is the current container ID then what I can do I",
  "is the current container ID then what I can do I can actually commit this particular container ID so I have forgot how do we actually commit maybe I will just do a search over here I think I will just need to provide the continer ID which is this one so it have created a container and now that I have committed it I can actually push it to dockerhub and then you can actually download it from the docker Hub so if you have location to this particular image then you can actually download it from",
  "image then you can actually download it from dockerhub and then when when you pull the image then what you get is uh there will be a UB to machine and in that UB to machine you will also get python which I have installed so that way you can even configure what you want so let us say you don't want to install Java you just want to install Python and there are very few limited things that you want to install in in your container and then you can push it and then actually you can use it later so",
  "push it and then actually you can use it later so anyone have any doubt on it all these recordings are shared on YouTube right yeah all these recordings usually within a day so usually by tomorrow by tomorrow noon or something it usually gets you because there's so much steps to follow if you do not have recording it may no definitely the be very clear yeah yeah tools uh tools and data science um if you go to the playlist U for January 25 all the sessions are recorded uh if I may say one thing",
  "sessions are recorded uh if I may say one thing C uh is is there a is there a demo demo where we have used all the tools in a single project like um I'm like so that I can go through that and can come back and then ask questions if how things are getting so what will happen is we will have a separate session for project okay um that will probably be towards the either the end of this week or or next beginning of next week and um in in those sessions with regards to project we will actually",
  "sessions with regards to project we will actually construct um all the pieces of the pipeline um to give you an idea of how project fits together all the tools that you requireed to put it together into project so we will take you through that okay so one more quick question with this uh if someone goes through uh CSS JavaScript GitHub and uh the rest API thing so almost 60% of the things will be shorted after that because the rest all to like what I'm telling is all like at the core of",
  "like what I'm telling is all like at the core of everything the things which which are the Legacy tools or things which are not going to change there will be rest API uh JavaScript HTML CSS these things and uh so what I'm asking is if I if I study four or five selected four or five subjects like these will I be able to like like on the go I can learn other tools which which are being taught over here yeah yeah definitely I mean the um the core tools remain the same the web Technologies all",
  "tools remain the same the web Technologies all remain the same everything is built upon basically uh you know the Dom and HTML and JavaScript and then you of course you have the networking stack and these sorts of things um but once uh once you know those concepts of how for example the web works you know in terms of uh requests work what is expected in the headers um once you get to good grips with web Technologies then these tools just enhance what you're able to deliver in a timely fashion",
  "what you're able to deliver in a timely fashion and in a way that uh really um enables data to reach uh people where you wanted to reach them you know it's not like uh before where people are sitting in a single office in a corporate and then someone is showing a PowerPoint presentation it's not like that anymore right so um so that's what these tools help you deliver it helps you deliver your data to whoever needs it where they need it and but the core Technologies haven't changed they have",
  "the core Technologies haven't changed they have probably been the same for the past 30 years I think got it so I just wanted to know these things so that like like superficially I can go go over all the other tools and in depth I'll try to learn the the few names which I have to yeah one new thing that is worth um really trying to get to grips with is uh how llms figure into all this how gpts figure into all this so we will spend extensive amount of time dealing with that uh because that's also",
  "of time dealing with that uh because that's also the professor's intention that students really understand this very well so we will spend a significant portion on llms and how they work and how they fit into the work flow how they make your apps intelligent because that's the that's the key thing now like the era of statically programming um some fixed custom solution is um I won't say it's coming to an end but it is certainly um not enough now we want intelligent uh adaptive programs so we",
  "we want intelligent uh adaptive programs so we will teach you how to achieve that that is definitely something I hope we will be able to impart to yeah that will suffice great um so I hope this session was useful to you guys I think we may how long you think take to just demonstrate so fast API is not very difficult to demonstrate it take only a few minutes so if you guys are willing we'll just uh finish up a fast API and then call it a night is that okay yeah okay uh so so far what we have",
  "is that okay yeah okay uh so so far what we have done we have actually searched for the uh existing uh images that are available somewhere on the internet and then we have just pulled it up and then we have run we we tried to run it run that particular thing in a container and then we have installed Python and then we have committed it so uh what if you want to create image by yourself then what you do you create a Docker file uh in your system and then you mention which version of python you",
  "and then you mention which version of python you want and then this is the way to set up uh the working directory and then you execute some commands so this would uh within the container it will create app.py file which will have print hello world in it and then at the end what it what this will do it will execute this particular command so if you build image using it and then at the end if you just run this image then what it will do it it will run this app.py which is inside container and",
  "run this app.py which is inside container and then it will so this app dop have hello world that needs to be printed so it will print hello world on your terminal so if I just create CD XPR and now what I will do I will create a Docker file I think name of the docker file would be Docker file it's a small F and now I will just copy this stuff from here to here and then I this image so what this this command will do this will actually build the image and then this dot tells that this Docker file",
  "and then this dot tells that this Docker file will be present in current working directory and then this minus t uh is to put some tag for the image so if I just build this image it will automatically detect the docker file yeah it will automatically detect the docker file if you instead of this dot if you just put some other directory let us say it is the docker file is not in the current working directory it is some in some other directory then you can mention that directory and to build the",
  "you can mention that directory and to build the docker file uh to build the docker image it have run these four steps so one is it have got this python here and then it have set up the the working directory and then it have created a file app. Pi which have print hello world in it and then it it it will run this particular command so now what I will do I will copy it and I will so before I run it we need to look at all the images that are currently on my system so this is one image that I have",
  "on my system so this is one image that I have just created few minutes ago that is present on my local system and it is it is its name is p hyphen hello so now what I will do I will um run this particular image and this would print hello world so if I just put bash over here it will open here and now if I just say LS see it just have one file so this piece of code it have set up the uh the working directory so when I opened it it have got this directory so if I just do PWD I'm current right now",
  "so if I just do PWD I'm current right now inside this directory and within this directory it have created this particular file and that I can show using LS and I think I can even list the version of python so it is using 311.11 and I have mentioned 3.11 and this slim I don't know what it does Colton do you have any idea about what the slim would do I think it's just a build of python that uh probably uh just has the basic uh what you call library is the set maybe it mentions about a particular",
  "is the set maybe it mentions about a particular version of 3.11 so basically what I was trying to show you can actually go inside this particular container and then you can have a look at which all files are there and then you can even look for the container version so whatever you mention while you're uh building the image using this docker file whatever version you mention that vers the same version you can have access over here and now that I have built this image I can actually push this",
  "I have built this image I can actually push this image to dockerhub and then you can download this image and then you get the same version of python and everything you can just run this particular command and then you will be able to execute it can we uh kind of wrap our uh mad one mad 2 projects like this do talk yeah absolutely that's very possible that talk defitely like to try that later maybe sometime sure uh CT what are we going to do now so what uh someone was trying to say something yes",
  "what uh someone was trying to say something yes so I was going to say if you wanted to get a quick overview of what fast API is it's basically like flask but way better the reason I say way better is um it uh flask when you install flask if you want uh additional functionality like authentication and there are some various other aspects of flk each of them built upon FL through extensions you have to keep on um importing extensions into flasks to get more functionality fast API usually packages",
  "get more functionality fast API usually packages all of it um most of the core important things uh that you would expect to use on a day-to-day basis fast API already has them integrated into it and more significantly fast API is uh built for asynchronous operations so uh just as the name sounds um it's a much more scalable than a flask application so when you want to deploy it scale and you want to do it very quickly and easily then fast API is the main differentiator between flas API and",
  "is the main differentiator between flas API and flask so that's uh that's why we showing you fast API because to do flask it's like uh you know there's an entire sorry entire course that kind of teaches you that right so but this Tools in data science and we're not going to spend the whole term teaching you FL so fast API does the same thing uh in a small need package so what is [Music] uvon uh UV is basically you run the application on a specific host and then you also specify the port number",
  "host and then you also specify the port number so it is just the way to run a server so in this particular specific code what it is doing it is creating an instance of fast API and then it is it it have the end point or that is just the back slash and then whenever you hit this particular end point then all it does it it will get you this particular Json object the benefit of using fast API is you can have you can hit the end point as synchronously so you can send multiple request send has",
  "so you can send multiple request send has stoed uh I don't know I Disturbed Okay C dot CD XPR I think I will go to the same directory and and I will create one file let's go index. p and in that I will put all this code and then I have got this metod I over here all all these dependencies just run this file and it have got this over here you're trying to access it um from outside WSL that's why your browser is not seeing it yeah okay so I will have to get the um actual host for it config so",
  "have to get the um actual host for it config so instead of this over here I will just change it so earlier what I was doing I will I was running it inside WSL that's why I was not able to access it on this particular host address so virtual machine had some other host address if I tried to access it through that host address then I would be able to access this particular application just a quick clarification here so for the those of you who don't understand what happened here although jaraj is",
  "understand what happened here although jaraj is operating on the same physical machine as U as the uh WSL uh to the computer these are two separate machines the WSL inside is a completely separate computer as far as it's aware from the networking stack point of view so but the browser that he's using is on Windows right so when his windows is trying to access that IP address 00 8,000 it's looking on the Windows machine for it but actually it's running inside the VM and that's why he had to look",
  "inside the VM and that's why he had to look up what the uh vm's uh IP address connection to the outside world was and communicate bya that I hope that made sense for you in case you were wondering why what had to just happen to okay so I think that covers it right are there any questions um any doubts that you want cleared up okay if um so if used if config if if yeah he used if config inside the WSL machine to find out what its actual I external IP address was okay so when uh can I ask yes Yes",
  "IP address was okay so when uh can I ask yes Yes actually like um so this is my verel app which has been deployed like was it discussed in the session like I didn't attend uh Hara can you share your screen um yeah minute I am having problem with that uh so I think the issue is uh if I just go to versel and then if I go over here and what you would have done I think you would have opened this particular URL most probably no not this one I think this is the one that you would have opened um uh",
  "this is the one that you would have opened um uh are you trying come back just Chrome uh uh like I just restart the Chrome and then come back like it's not allowing me to share it's saying uh uh some permission denied in Mac actually I'll just restart just can you be on hold I'll rejoin the call okay so in the meantime if somebody else have some doubt on some some topic then you can ask so this is list of I think we can stop recording now as well so",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/QnLi-C_LiXk =====",
  "am I audible yes yes a yes sir you're audible sure so uh yeah I think uh there could be multiple questions for uh this discussion let's start with major uh queries anyone want to ask questions or queries with respect to yes Anan morti uh hi so I asked this question yesterday and I just wanted to reiterate so uh what I asked Caron was regarding the base uh Technologies which I should learn at least to a certain depth so that the future of TDS will be easier for me so the one which I have listed",
  "be easier for me so the one which I have listed where um CSS HTML and JavaScript along with that a little bit of bash and sh shell scripting and the third one will be the rest API so will these three things keeping keeping them as the base will I will I be able to take over all the other topics which are there uh can you yeah can you repeat that uh again like the tools or techniques that you're bash and cell scripting first second one will be a little bit of git and uh a little bit of about git",
  "bit of git and uh a little bit of about git third will be uh CSS uh HTML JavaScript M and fourth will be the rest API understood and uh the major scripting language might be python or JavaScript yeah yeah so so so so the rest of the things which Carlton clearly explained was like uh these tools can be learned on the go once we we have a little bit of uh knowledge about all these Technologies so will like uh will that statement remains uh valid now also like because I asked it yesterday only",
  "now also like because I asked it yesterday only indeed no no indeed it's valid so so let's let's uh take a moment on understanding how the tools are set up here so uh we can classify the entire uh course into different sections like the purpose which will include web scraping which will include uh logical Expressions B scripting uh which will include uh deployment using scripting so so essentially you can consider uh uh the concepts to be learned with respect to what is the purpose of uh the",
  "with respect to what is the purpose of uh the concept to learn second thing is what is the utility so when I say utility uh scripting you can do it with JavaScript you can do with python so either one of the uh scpt scripting language should give you the basic intent of how to script so so scripting or programming is something which is uh based on one native script that could help you so let's say if you're a python programmer um you can easily shift to another program as long as you are",
  "shift to another program as long as you are familiar with programming and scripting apart from that the remaining tools like git bash cell scripting rest AP these are all uh additional or let's say these are all uh uh scripts are techniques that are used to Aid you in ensuring that you're able to complete your uh activity so uh if I if I if I put it again in uh what we discussed first is purpose second is what technique you're using and finally what uh tools and uh other support uh details",
  "what uh tools and uh other support uh details which I need so this would be a backbone structure of how you can learn any tool or any uh uh deployment or any activity I think this would help us on a help you on a longer term and uh coming back in our TDS course web scraping you need CSS HTML uh from a scripting perspective you need JavaScript or Python and from a deployment perspective you'll need the remaining bash or RP whatever it is required so I would I would suggest you it's not Rand all",
  "so I would I would suggest you it's not Rand all these tools are not randomly set in uh like different uh elements in a network it's basically a sequential order as long as the uh tool and the technique fits for your purpose it'll be uh efficient for you to use it for the TDS course was I able to answer or still uh it was uh no no it was good it was it was sufficing all the things so Al so in short if I if you can underline anything so learning all these things to certain depth not at the level",
  "these things to certain depth not at the level of what they are teaching in diploma so learning these things at a certain level will like help us to cruise the whole of TDs is it the right statement to make yeah uh so I would add one more point when you say learn a tool to a certain extent so the learning process always comes with purpose that's why I said purpose to be the first thing so uh we cannot be an expert in pandas if you ask me uh uh even though I have scripted for for almost uh uh",
  "even though I have scripted for for almost uh uh last 13 years still I would say I'm not an expert in pandas but I know how I can get my task to be done using pandas so that's how uh the entire uh industry or the real world scenario uh uh is out there here uh all you need is purpose and how you can fulfill that with the scripting knowledge and or the technology or the technique which use so I think uh uh coming back you may not go to a specific let's say I'm going to bash scripting and you not",
  "let's say I'm going to bash scripting and you not write a complex bash script or understand a complex bash script all you need is you should know the basics of the bash script so that you can execute it whenever you wanted got it got it got it so in depth I I I won't recommend anybody to go in depth on these seven topics go and understand CSS Ajax so if you if you go to a specific tool and technique it'll uh it'll be kind of a rabbit to where based on your requirement it will keep on uh uh uh",
  "on your requirement it will keep on uh uh uh adding elements to the existing uh tool or a technique which you're learning so essentially the idea here is understand the purpose and use that tool for the purpose and that is sufficient maybe when the next purpose comes in and as you go through as we go through the courses uh course content further I think the course content is completely available in uh the portal right from uh all the different modules as you see the module you can see the",
  "modules as you see the module you can see the activities or the purpose or the specific tasks which we do and uh you as long as you are able to uh use these commands and use the techniques within that limit whatever is it is intended to for the course that is sufficient now you need not specifically take a separate course on rest AP separate course on uh um uh bash uh in detail basic uh understanding which uh with these uh tools and techniques which you mentioned is sufficient got it got it got",
  "you mentioned is sufficient got it got it got it so rest of the things like Fast API all these things will come along once we are good to go with I I'll tell you a simple example so if you're trying to understand rest API you need to implement it using uh a library or a framework past AP is that framework got it got it thanks thanks for the explanation thank you yeah and uh sh we C hello sir yes sir I have a question that from uh week two the last two questions Lama file and DOA file do we need",
  "two questions Lama file and DOA file do we need to install all those application for doing the question or we can do in online also uh this is for know that for that we have to download the docker file or anything related to that or we can just do a manually by creating an account online in the doer yeah yeah one second MH uh can you repeat the question for uh yes the last question sir the Lama file and there has one question related to Docker uh to import an image on Docker so can we do that",
  "uh to import an image on Docker so can we do that by just simply creating an account online uh uh profile on the docker or just you have to download the desktop version for that no uh see in order to uh get the specific uh Docker image I think that is sufficient for getting it from the uh standard Docker U uh reposes but to deploy that you'll definitely need so let's say if you're running Docker yes you need to deploy that sir yes we to deploy that so in order to run Docker there are multiple",
  "that so in order to run Docker there are multiple options you can run a Docker you need not set up everything in your remote system you can always okay as I mentioned collab uh the instances in runtime the collab runtime is basically a Linux environment or you can choose the specific environments and you can run that directly in the collab okay so and one more question uh there's a question related to versel okay so I have uh imported the project deployed the project uh by connecting with the",
  "deployed the project uh by connecting with the GitHub account but in that case uh I've got the URL also but it's showing error 44 error means I'm not able to find that why showing the error is it something which you have raised in discourse already because yeah generally okay uh this is regarding to uh then second one is regarding to the versal sir versal question okay uh my suggestion is generally with errors if you can send screenshots or with respect to uh much more detail will help hello",
  "respect to uh much more detail will help hello yeah okay means uh you saying that to post the screenshot in the discourse right sir yes exactly that would help us to uh debug this in detail okay okay okay so I will send that okay thank you sir so uh usually uh 44 error comes with the the page is not available yes see the page is not available but I'm not finding the exact error the what's happening actually okay and Sir another one uh the last question of week two the Lama file okay MH I have",
  "question of week two the Lama file okay MH I have uh means I have pasted the URL of that so at first it's showing me correct okay and after saving that we I'm refreshing the page after refreshing when I'm trying to check that out it's showing me incorrect why is like that uh can you okay I can share my screen sir yeah please go ahead yeah please go ahead Okay Okay one minute sir I want one clarification M if it is related to the similar question I think we can go ahead wait for yeah yes sir are",
  "I think we can go ahead wait for yeah yes sir are these graded assignments are not not open internet right yes that's correct no no they're open internet okay sir they mentioned that if you took to if you if you will take two hours so those those hours we can use internet too so this question this this one the Lama file okay at first at first it's showing correct okay so I have got eight at first and now when I'm uh refreshing the page and I'm checking the same thing the reloaded page I have",
  "checking the same thing the reloaded page I have uploaded at the time when I got the eight and at this time when I'm again refreshing the page and reloading the same thing that I've got eight and when I'm checking that it's giving me error like that yeah um my suggestions please add them to the discourse so that it might require uh uh so in the discour my uh the uh suggestion is along with the screenshots add the email ID so that we'll basically go to the back end and fetch the exact uh okay",
  "go to the back end and fetch the exact uh okay okay sir yeah we'll cross verify with the scripts sir sir same is with me also yeah please raise it in discourse uh we can be one thread where if this is the issue we can add along and uh add the screenshot with the email ID so that we'll be it'll be easy for us to debug okay sir okay okay got it sir got it and meanwhile uh there was one other query we just discussed about open internet and not open internet so all these uh G are open internet I",
  "internet so all these uh G are open internet I think you have the content which is available over there to work with and then uh just execute okay sir thank you so sir those two hours getting in in yeah if if you go to Tool data science if you go to Tools in data science and uh uh check out the introduction where we have mentioned about evaluations are mostly open internet all the graded assignments it will be online open McQ and okay uh ex I mean with respect to TDs course the only no internet",
  "with respect to TDs course the only no internet would be the final exam final interm exam will be an inperson no internet which is mandat and that's the purpose apart from that all the be it project take home or everything is an open internet open for collaboration yeah okay sir thank you thank you clarification yeah uh yeah Bisal yes please a good evening sir sir uh it seems the session is being conducted by you rather than JJ and San is this session for different purposes uh so okay so there",
  "for different purposes uh so okay so there are knowledge sharing sessions and there are query sessions so basically Carlton and myself were instructors so uh this session specifically for queries with respect to uh uh the discourse or anything with respect to operations and then trying to do with a debug session or a troubleshooting session so that's the uh purpose and with respect to sarange JJ uh and Calton and maybe future we also will have knowledge sharing SS where it will be a Hands-On uh",
  "sharing SS where it will be a Hands-On uh uh session where we take one concept or two concepts run it through across uh uh in a Hands-On mode sir also sir if is it possible uh sir can you uh like ask uh I don't know who is responsible for uploading the live sessions into the YouTube but yesterday's live session has not yet been uploaded and I wanted to just rewatch that sure sure sure yes we make no sir it's been uploaded sir I think in the calendar so I I do get note that from an",
  "in the calendar so I I do get note that from an Administration perspective we are uploading all the uh uh YouTube sessions uh within a day not more than a day uh so if uh I think some of you mentioned that it is available so do check this out if you still see that uh it's not available just uh you can mail I think you have the email ID you can mail or I think I think the last time I checked it wasn't uploaded I checked around 600 p.m. okay so I'll make a note of it anyways I'll make a note of",
  "make a note of it anyways I'll make a note of it within a day so yesterday's session probably before tomorrow uh noon you should be able to see sir I just checked again into the playlist it's not yet been up understood okay I I have made made a note of it we'll uh we'll check internally thank you sir yeah D Shri yes please yes sir good evening good evening uh sir uh my problem is in the gab sir it is not signing in for uh I mail that shouldn't be a problem so did you try uh signing up for the",
  "be a problem so did you try uh signing up for the first time yes sir sir is Gab available for only personal email or even iatm email separately it is available for any email but I Med you have to sign up first and then sign in so if you sign up obviously it will ask for the if you already so there are two ways if you already have a giup account which is personal uh you you will always know what it is but for all of evaluation purpose and your submissions will be mapped with the email ID with",
  "submissions will be mapped with the email ID with which it's logged in so essentially we wanted you to sign up for the IAT email address yes sir and uh what would be the password no no you have to sign up sign up uh sorry yeah yes sir so for the gab question which a person just asked so sir this this uh if we have signed in using a personal ID but also have our itm ID will that be a problem if we have a it ID as secondary ID okay there are two questions first uh I'll answer the one which is",
  "questions first uh I'll answer the one which is recent so uh when you asked what are the ID what id was you mentioning about uh email ID sir IIT this one is is the screen visible sir yes so this is my email ID MH and uh if if I'm trying to sign in it is not watch sir how to present the screen sir it's not moving may can share your en screen but only only open this maybe in full screen or something okay so uh I'll show you one things okay ENT screen sir how to share the screen sir uh you can",
  "screen sir how to share the screen sir uh you can still use a present now and share it okay sir there should be any I think I did see it for a while and then it just went off so if you're doing it for the first time you may have to sign up for the GitHub account yes sir this is my email ID and I uh I have typed my I password as my password and uh when I click sign in is showing incorrect username or password in in the bottom below sign in if you see new to GitHub create an account right so if",
  "see new to GitHub create an account right so if you're if this email ID already has an account obviously you'll be able to login if this is the first time you're doing you may have to create an account uh with the name name of uh this Sir with the username email address yes yes same uh same email address yeah uh we can create different password yes it will be a separate account yes yes sir uh when I'm trying the same it is showing as uh verify that and giving a small game verification game uh",
  "that and giving a small game verification game uh when I'm uh I have finished my game and uh seeing it is again reloading the same page not forwarding with a password no no if you create account it will ask for email ID username and uh password and uh once we continue it might ask for any verification with email and uh you should be able to log in sir what is the username sir so username can be a short form of your uh name or you can still use 23 f3001 that is basically how uh it's like uh",
  "23 f3001 that is basically how uh it's like uh email ID versus username typically what we use can you click create account yes sir is the screen moving yes no no I don't see any cursor there in your uh screen okay sir I'll click so I'm I'm unable to do three questions sir no I totally understand but uh I don't I mean is this a problem for uh most of the other uh uh students here no Okay so basically it's uh I I don't think this is a challenge the it's it should be uh pretty much straightforward",
  "it's it should be uh pretty much straightforward all uh I can guide you let me share my screen I can guide you how this is done yes sir so is my screen visible no sir so if you go to is my screen visible now yes sir yes sir so if you go there are two options sign in and sign up so if you click sign up it will ask you for email ID password and then a username and then once if you click continue uh possibly it will send out a link or a verification link to your uh email ID and uh so if you go",
  "link to your uh email ID and uh so if you go back to the email you can check and there will be a link for verification once that is clicked you'll be able to uh go to the login page yes sir then you'll come back to this page where you'll have email address and the password with which you have signed up if you type it you'll be able to open up G yes sir I have did it for my personal account yesterday sir but trying the same with I account isn't working okay I'll share this can you yeah can you",
  "working okay I'll share this can you yeah can you add one discourse post because I I have done it with multiple email both with personal and I I haven't faced it up if if there's any specific error or if anything shows in the sign up page can you add that in discourse yes sir yeah thanks uh mainly the problem comes with my username sir while signing up uh it is showing uh it is not available and uh if I type any other username also it is showing it is not available sir for creating uh maybe in",
  "it is not available sir for creating uh maybe in that case you have to uh modify the username uh so so it when it says username unavailable it's already being taken by someone else uh my suggestion would be the uh student ID which you have you can still use that but uh three questions are dependent only on this sir no I totally understand yeah totally understand uh as long as you have a unique username you should be able to solve this problem so this is the problem sir no uh yeah here the usern",
  "this is the problem sir no uh yeah here the usern name uh uh diva is very generalized so that it's it might already been used by multiple uh somebody else earlier so you should have a unique username uh can you add the 23 f3001 255 anything yes sir I'll add any numbers so you have that right sorry is it visible is the screen visible yeah but there was a visual puzzle right you have to finish that visual puzzle yes sir till yesterday uh it didn't even work sir no as long as you have a unique",
  "even work sir no as long as you have a unique username you should be able to create an account okay with only numbers no any any account it should be unique the username which you create must be unique okay sir I'll create it by now I'm facing this trouble and I'm unable to do my three to four questions about the the GitHub M even in my graded one no understand yeah I even posted in discourse sir already uh is this okay sir no add more numbers it's generalized still take the 23 f3125 your the",
  "it's generalized still take the 23 f3125 your the student ID or the ID which you have in the top yes sir The password should be the same as our IIT email sir no not required uh we can add our own password yes yes uh I added the same password so e that shouldn't be it shouldn't be a problem yeah okay uh yeah so there will be an uh code that is sent to your email ID if you copy the code you should be able to sign in yes sir yeah in the interest of time can I move on to the next uh question yes",
  "of time can I move on to the next uh question yes sir yes sir yeah you can try in the parallel and if you still problem we can come back again at the end of the session okay sir thank you sir yeah sang uh yeah yeah hello sir good evening yes good evening uh sir I have a challenge in graded assignment two for the image compression I'm getting this error uh one second I'll just share my screen MH so this was the error uh could not process the image is it browser supported image image pixels do",
  "is it browser supported image image pixels do not match the original Okay so tried in several ways I use SOS uh you know the image resolution is same tried to compare it it appeared same visually to me but somehow it is not accepting what is the size of this image uh it is 1438 I can show it to you yeah 1430 143 okay 1473 bytes so basically the size is 1473 and I think uh on the it is 1 yeah portal we have mentioned it's one not more than 15 yeah I don't know maybe if others were able to",
  "15 yeah I don't know maybe if others were able to complete it is it issue as an i I'm using Chrome and that shouldn't be a problem with uh a browser here I tried changing pallette everything nothing worked and the image pixel uh do not [Music] match we didn't have this problem while uh checking this out so did you try with other browsers yes sir I tried with brave and this is in Chrome okay first it didn't work in Brave I thought it is some antics of Brave browser so then using Chrome because",
  "of Brave browser so then using Chrome because this doesn't have any extensions or additions Etc okay that could complicated and you have a discourse post associated with this uh yes sir I have put it on discourse this is the post I'll just make a note of it let me okay this is kind of unique uh I Tred as in first it was not uploading then I tried to reduce the pallet it became even less in size than 1 KB also but uh with webp and it was becoming like much lesser than that but somehow it was",
  "like much lesser than that but somehow it was still not accepting so okay let me take this as a prim note so this is across browsers you're having this issue right yes sir I have not tried through Firefox I'll maybe try it if you want can you can you share the discourse link uh in the chat uh discour link sorry the one I mean URL the above URL yeah one second I'm just sharing it sir okay thanks for this let me check this in couple of browsers and see whether I'm able to recreate this scenario",
  "see whether I'm able to recreate this scenario okay the challenge is I think we were not able to recreate this scenario in different methods and uh yeah we'll get back uh in a day on this okay okay thank you so much sir sir this GitHub confusion uh sorry I just joined and I was hearing Divya so I actually used my personal repository uh personal GitHub account so is that okay or do I need to recreate those assignments in the one withm email ID I don't think so but uh but uh shouldn't be a",
  "ID I don't think so but uh but uh shouldn't be a problem but uh let let me cross verify that again I uh I I'll check this out because some of the uh referrals we are taking from uh the email ID and that email ID is basically based on U the course sign up or GitHub we'll just uh check that I think it should be a problem because you're posting the URL uh in the portal and already the portal signed in with uh the email ID so I don't see it should be a challenge but I'll confirm it again uh or an",
  "be a challenge but I'll confirm it again uh or an email or a announcement yeah if you could yeah do the announcement because yeah I don't think it will be like a big challenge it should be a challenge I don't I don't think it should be a challenge I don't think we have used anywhere uh the user accounts that uh are being set but as a process I'll just confirm whether typically you require to mention the email ID uh in that repository or you know of actions one of the state names is the email ID",
  "of actions one of the state names is the email ID so that has been done yeah and yeah and and I think that should be fine we we we will not uh need to have something very specific with the user ID the only request is I just want to check with the operations and the regulations like whether it's mandate for each candidate to create one GitHub account with this itail ID I'll just check that out and come back in a day okay from a TDS submissions perspective you shouldn't have any challenge okay",
  "perspective you shouldn't have any challenge okay okay thank you sir yeah that's all I wanted to check so I will wait for your response on discourse for the image compression problem yeah VI Kumar uh hello sir yes uh sir I have posted uh that doubt in the discourse okay okay so yes that's yeah hello hello yes yeah I'm want to ask like whether someone need to choose the project or it will by default it will add it to our course the TS project uh okay the TDS project we have to choose selecting",
  "okay the TDS project we have to choose selecting that course or it will by default it will come with course U I don't think I understand the question is it sir he's confusing the TS project with other MLP and mad one mad 2 projects it's not it's not a separate project like other Theory courses it's I think it is inside the main Theory course we have right okay I think I I haven't uh got exposed to rest of the courses but in TDS a project is within the portal and you'll have notifications and",
  "the portal and you'll have notifications and all the details coming you would have received the notification earlier as well with respect to what project is yeah yeah like I want to ask like whether we have to separately choose project as we are choosing for other subject or oh no so if you're thinking about Capstone project for something like which you can choose for other courses for TDS as you see in the introduction there will be two take-home projects so if you see the evaluation criteria",
  "projects so if you see the evaluation criteria we have gas uh Creed assignment across each module and uh we have uh a project which is uh take-home project it will be open in the portal for a different duration and uh I can even yeah so if you see the timeline we have our first project which was uh released on 19th over uh last uh yeah I think it's Sunday and uh the submission date is 15th Feb so essentially close to 20 days uh and uh this will be a take home project so you you'll be able to uh",
  "a take home project so you you'll be able to uh click the link from uh yeah click the link from and then get uh uh the details about the project you'll have two projects in TDS uh seven graded assignments one remote online and one final end exam so everything is a part of the course it's nothing you can opt out separately or something which you can select uh which might be an option in other courses okay sir yeah okay sir I had a doubt yes regarding the operations that uh will you be uh",
  "regarding the operations that uh will you be uh evaluating our answers once the deadline is over because uh you see when I first submitted my my answers it was all good but then I heard on discourse that uh few of the answers were you know evaluation scripts were updated for some Corner cases and stuff so there's a chance that my answers might not be you know correct after if you are doing it again uh and this might be the case for all of the graded assignments throughout the course so I just",
  "assignments throughout the course so I just wanted to clear it out right now uh should I be worried about this no no no the the idea here is uh when we say there is a revision of the evaluation script it's going to address additional Corner cases so uh on a on a and and these are randomized uh uh scripts so basically uh consider like in uh uh segment like you there's a random data generated only for the email ID based on the email ID and uh that data might have a space or a gap and there would",
  "data might have a space or a gap and there would be specific use cases found not for you but for some other uh student so what we do is we ensure that all the corner cases are addressed during an evaluation script uh but essentially whatever you have submitted I I don't feel you should have like a variation from what it is submitted so did you did you when is it with respect to ga1 or ga2 yeah yeah this is ga1 yeah uh both of them actually uh there was few cases where anun s has you know said",
  "was few cases where anun s has you know said that he has updated the evaluation script and so it just made me think that I have I have successfully submitted it but uh should I just go and recheck in case my answers are not correct anymore in case if you I mean it shouldn't be the case because when we do a evaluation script update it basically covers I mean uh when the evaluation script basically covers all the general use cases we might have uh based on discourse and few other uh queries we",
  "uh based on discourse and few other uh queries we might have found out rare Corner cases that can happen for few other students because all these questions are randomized so in order to address them the evaluator script will be uh updated but I would suggest you to use G2 as an exercise just go and type the same thing and do check answers so if you all right you should get the same number we are trying to evaluate I mean when there's an upgrade it's upgrade of script adding Corner cases not",
  "it's upgrade of script adding Corner cases not excluding the existing uh cases all right all right Al how will we submit the project one like we going to be a g form or it be the same webite that we using just asking for future uh I think project one is uh released and you can see how the deliverables are deliverable will be creating a giup repos Tre submitting it in the Google form Okay g form it is then yeah yeah it's a g all right that was just my doubts yeah thanks yeah yeah uh think we",
  "just my doubts yeah thanks yeah yeah uh think we have yeah Diva yes please uh hello sir yes Yesa yes sir oh is open thank you sir yeah I okay it's open now okay i i s the hand was raised so I thought you had a question so I hope you able to you're able to sign in now yes sir sir okay I had a question sir yes so what is this markdown sir the first question you mean is it the question of what markdown is or uh yes sir uh in that they have given uh to uh write link test and image alt URLs no sir",
  "to uh write link test and image alt URLs no sir uh what to write in those area sir for what links we should write can you share the screen yes sir this one so okay so this is Mark down syntax so basically this is the syntax okay yes sir now what uh uh can we write the syntax form in our own words sir in our own way yeah so basically markdown is a syntax by which you can Define the layout of a document if you're creating a mind map you can still use the same set of syntaxes if you use the hash",
  "use the same set of syntaxes if you use the hash symbol it means it will create heading one so let's say if you're trying to create a um uh let's say project report uh heading one so if you type hash and then type project report that will be the title or the heading one under the project report if you have seven titles uh I mean subtitles or let's say sections you can have double hash and then have the first section and then have whatever entry or detail you want to add in and uh use other",
  "or detail you want to add in and uh use other these are this is a syntax by which you can uh change the layout or see the how the appearance of the text and the data uh is yes sir sir what about these two links what should I post in those area no I don't think I still get your uh question so in uh down of the second item there's a link test and image Alt uh in the syntax itself no no this is an image file this is an image file and it says common markdown syntax right so so we can use any image",
  "markdown syntax right so so we can use any image like from pexel or something any any openly available image right maybe from Wikipedia or anything any anything yeah anything yes any image sir any image any URL yes any image with a public URL which anybody can access without any copyright issue right of course yes what about the link text any URL uh there is no specification it can be any URL okay so Random URL yeah uh so one more thing is that uh should we write this in our One Way Or should",
  "uh should we write this in our One Way Or should can we use any AI tools to generate this markdown uh specifically uh see ideally it's more to understand the concept and then execute so uh I would uh uh give the choice to you it can either uh you can either use I mean whatever tools which is available the challenge is recreating that would be uh even if you use a tool I would recommend to understand how this down structure is so that you are uh coming back to the first discussion here purpose",
  "coming back to the first discussion here purpose technique and then the tool or the library so if the purpose is uh to understand markdown you may have to you can use any tool but at the end you should know what you're actually submitting yes sir so one more thing so one more doubt is that uh can you please suggest any best AI tools to do these graded assignments in common you already have an open AI uh proxy uh which is generated by the T TDS team for assignments that is separate but uh um",
  "team for assignments that is separate but uh um yeah these are options that I would uh suggest you to check that out I think there's open uh AI chat GPT that is also said I think anas just Shar that he has given perplexity Pro for all it madas students exactly sir so there are two things here uhan so first thing is uh in order to use a markdown or have a script so uh in the graded assignment or on the project you can see project link there is something called AA proxy you can use AA proxy which",
  "called AA proxy you can use AA proxy which is an uh uh which has uh I think that rate is dollar a dollar for a month you can raise requests via API programmatically use uh an llm Tool uh and you have everybody has credit uh uh $1 credit for a month and uh uh uh there is a procedure by which you can get that proxy it's already there in the project uh one submission or the specific portal which you enter in okay so so that is there apart from that uh there is no specific like benchmark with",
  "that uh there is no specific like benchmark with respect to llm tools LM tools are uh getting uh smarter and robust day by day so there's nothing specific you can mention in a day whatever we say today may get outnumbered immediately after the a week or so okay sir so one more doubt is that for graded assignment to pass the graded assignment uh for 10 points how many points is uh required uh uh okay so there are a couple of things one is uh the graded assignments are used as an criteria for R",
  "graded assignments are used as an criteria for R term and you can also go to the introduction page where we have the percentage criteria uh how much we are utilizing for grad assignment I would recommend you to uh read the introduction document and then uh get clarity of uh what the assessment that we are doing with the graded G they said uh for five graded assignments at least two should be GR greater than or equal to 40 for 100 uh so for in each sub in each grade assignment if you get uh",
  "each sub in each grade assignment if you get uh greater than four points then it uh uh we are eligible for writing n term right greater than four points for 10 yeah so the end term you should have that grading document uh for the end term requirement right so I think that is uh 40 greater than or equal to 4400 yep uh so for 10 points we should get more than four four points MH yes no sir yes okay sir thank you okay I don't see any uh question questions any I mean hands raised any other",
  "questions any I mean hands raised any other questions s hi uh I have one doubt in dat designment one actually uh in that one uh Jon sorting the Json actually I got the correct actually uh i s the Json uh and put it into the input box but it is says a incorrect one uh actually a validated is a manual and also validated us the chat gbd and all uh it seems uh but in the portal says uh wrong only uh is this for the question number nine yeah oh just just yeah there can you share the screen we can uh",
  "yeah there can you share the screen we can uh re the I just sorted as Asen OU uh can you uh copy it and add it to a Json Checker and see whether uh you have any err okay the Json is valid if you go back to the G mhm okay I don't see a challenge here uh uh do you have a discourse post for this sorry is this query posted in discourse no no no uh my recommendation is post it in discourse along with the email ID so that it's uh it'll be easy for us to fix the error from the back end to understand",
  "to fix the error from the back end to understand where uh the issue is oh okay sure sure sure and also same also like I'm not sure my quy is wrong or right or wrong same thing uh just like uh I'm also same thing yeah I would say validate please no I don't think that is possible in a live session my suggestion is uh uh the query these are all tested which means that we have an available to skip and we also do a manual testing before we launch this da and for a fact I know that we did the right",
  "da and for a fact I know that we did the right query and then if you do the right query you'll be able to fix the uh answer okay but there is no way to check the do uh in this portal uh debug for the debu and all no you can create uh it create this exact uh uh gold data and then try uh correct actually there I think so there is a and something bunch of gold data in this uhb I just put it as a select quy uh which is a gold uh but I didn't get the full details okay I would say you can keep trying",
  "full details okay I would say you can keep trying that would be the best thing because we tested out with the right scpt yeah there is a right quer if you let the right query you will be able to achieve it sure sure sure okay okay regarding regarding the Json I I put it in the discourse I along with the email ID yes okay okay okay uh discourse means uh just the portal discussion portal am I right discussion portal yes create yeah create a new thread or if already there is a uh I think for",
  "thread or if already there is a uh I think for project one or anything we yeah each IND yes exactly each individual ga1 ga2 we have a separate discussion in thread you can add that detail here okay okay okay good thanks yeah arav [Music] Raj uh yes sir sir I wanted to ask a doubt in G1 question number 16 actually uh rest question I have done it and it all has been marked correct but in this question when when I am pasting that thing it's not accepting it sir uh I also chat Jed it but still I",
  "it sir uh I also chat Jed it but still I can't find the right way to do it or some else I don't know what is the issue so can you guide me please so uh G question number 16 is move on rename files yes sir uh that shouldn't be a problem I think uh we did this as well uh I don't do you have uh is there a specific error you're receiving in the portal While submitting uh no sir actually it's showing incorrect answer that's all okay uh have you posted this in discourse uh uh no sir I haven't yeah",
  "this in discourse uh uh no sir I haven't yeah I'll tell you the reason why we have this ideally most of the submissions some of the questions are randomized some of the questions are uh mixed so uh the idea here is once you a request you uh along with the email ID it'll be easy for us to track back what the submission was and from the evaluator script we will also have what the expected answer is so if the expected an answer is different from what you have submitted then we'll uh try to figure",
  "you have submitted then we'll uh try to figure out if there is any Corner case that is associated with the specific uh uh student ID okay sir so I should put this into discourse only that is correct yes okay sir thank you sir sir may I ask the question sir yeah I may take one or two questions now yeah yes sir I am using Windows uh many questions are to be solved in Ubunto so what I did I copy pasted uh the downloaded files for example zip files and extracted and pasted in WSL home home folder",
  "and extracted and pasted in WSL home home folder so I tried many questions I'm not getting correct anwers so were able to install Windows system Linux yes I I installed WSL I I am doing Mt to project in WSL only okay is there a specific error that you're facing in this uh WSM no sir I'm getting answer uh uh but I when I paste the answer here it's not coming should I share the screen sir yes okay sir just a two three minutes only so see here I copy pasted the file a. txt b.txt here MH when I do",
  "pasted the file a. txt b.txt here MH when I do this one I got 40 as the different when I submit here I was trying random numbers it's not passing this is the code I used D a.b. THD uh this is can I go back to the question yes said this one after downloading I unzipped in the downloaded folder and copy pasted these two files to the W okay how many lines are different between A and B we hadn't had any issues with this question as well like as I mentioned so we before launch we usually do a test",
  "so we before launch we usually do a test internally was this raised in discourse should I do this in front of you so how I did can you yeah is this raised in this course I'm not sure okay should I do this sir uh yeah yeah let's take one more minute okay sir after downloading I went here in the down I unzipped here uh extract all after unzipping uh these two files are there mhm so I I copied this and open to home I created a folder called TDS za1 I pasted here in to C do so CD no you can type CD",
  "I pasted here in to C do so CD no you can type CD Q compare T can you click uh yeah again space not coming I should have renamed it the similar way I did let's do this with with this one can I have quotations yeah that's fine the two files are there okay D A.T b.txt 5 WSC minus here I'm getting 40 m when I submit here it's not getting PA I thought this was the issue between Windows and WS MH you uh read the files maybe you can manually see which lines are there if there are any lines sir no I",
  "lines are there if there are any lines sir no I think uh WC minus any lines are there yeah so can you um can you share this in discourse again is it already sh in discourse along with not sure sir I will share tomorrow okay so sir isn't this the issue sir Windows WS uh I am not pretty much sure uh let I'll take a note I'll see whether this uh this is a challenge with uh yeah okay sir sir is there any possibility of extending the ga1 deadline sir I don't think so I don't think you'll have",
  "sir I don't think so I don't think you'll have extension of ga1 deadline uh but I think you can still try it out with collab if you go back to collab and then okay these two files in collab just load the files in collab and then try the same commands you should be able to to see whether you are uh getting yeah you can try that okay sir thanks sir actually I have found this Solution by using Excel even though it is not a correct approach ideally so the challenge is about um see we can bypass",
  "so the challenge is about um see we can bypass this now but the idea here is once you know the tools here more efficiently it's easy for processing uh in the previous live session if you see the time it takes for processing the files in Excel or any other additional tool is uh will be drastically reduced when you use a a command line prompt yeah Excel is time consuming yes that's true okay then I think we'll wind the session today um and uh I'll have noted down the queries uh whoever have not",
  "have noted down the queries uh whoever have not posted the uh queries and discourse please do post it so and along with the email ID so that it's easy for us to track back again sir your name to tag uh PR okay sir thanks okay then thank you have a great day good night sir thank you e e e e e hello so you are AFK I guess e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e",

  "so J are you going to take these questions uh the 16th and 17th question 17th I can take 16th also I can take right otherwise you can even I can take 16th question so I actually did it using a combination of uh bash commands and python so that's one way to solve it so if you agree I can take this question okay okay you can take it right let's wait for a couple of more minutes what are we going to join so s I've started the recording so you can start it anytime you ready all right all right uh",
  "start it anytime you ready all right all right uh jvrj uh uh can you please take this uh 17th question actually I'm struggling with something on my laptop sure sure in the meantime I will just figure it out you can just take the 17th question then I will continue with the 16th and then the 18th one then uh I will go with the flas all right so the way I have solved this question is I have just downloaded this particular Z folder and then there are these two files so what I have done I have",
  "are these two files so what I have done I have initialized a get repository and then uh I have just used so I have done it two times one is using diff command and another is using get diff command so I will just show both those ways e [Music] f [Applause] [Music] 2301 sir I have a question I think it's been asked before but uh sir I'm trying to look at my G1 I subed like four days back uh I see it's empty showing zero on 10 uh can you share your screen oh sir sorry sir I see that the different",
  "screen oh sir sorry sir I see that the different time stamps are there uh sorry sir by bad for sorry okay okay so if I just create a file let's call it uh some file and then if I write some piece of code for example if it have J Raj over here and then Shan and now let me create some other file uh let's call it uh two and then it have chrj as the first line which is SE as this one and on second line if it have Calon and now if I just use diff command over here uh diff and then I need to put the",
  "over here uh diff and then I need to put the name of both those files so I use def two and then this is some file so it shows us the difference between those two files so on the second line this is this is the difference between it and another way of doing it is I just finalize a get repo so I do get in it and then I will just check the status of those two files and now let us see if I just add second file and now I will commit the second file so now this first file I haven't added it so it is",
  "now this first file I haven't added it so it is still in untracked position so this but this some file is not being tracked by git as of now but the other file that is two it's been dragged so now what I will do I will uh change the name of this file as two so what I will do I will use some file and I will just rename it to two now I only have one particular file and now if I just look for a status it says this file have been modified now if I just commit this file I think before committing I",
  "just commit this file I think before committing I will have to add and get commit minus and this file have been added here and now if I look for get diff and then uh before that what I will need I will need to compare the difference between both those two commits so is it list or lists um so now I have forgot how do I list those two files how to list all the commits that I [Applause] made um okay L's on the replace with your name I think this is St JRA we can also do that we can just show this",
  "St JRA we can also do that we can just show this all this like comparing in the GitHub as well yeah I will first do it using git itself and then we'll it what is the first thing you did before the git one I just used the diff command that is uh that comes with BH okay so now I will compare these two commits and all those changes gets listed in the red and green so this is it compares the first commit with the second commit and then the F the first line remains same whereas the second line",
  "first line remains same whereas the second line changes from this shans gets removed and and gets added so this is change between those two commits so now I will create the same file again and let me call it I I will just copy the same content from here actually I don't have to do this what I will do I will just go to GitHub I will create the empty repo here and it can be any name it can be public and now I will add a file to it um there used to be a button to add file okay this is the one let",
  "be a button to add file okay this is the one let me call it two and this is the content of the file now I will just commit the changes so this was the first commit that's why there is no history to compare now what I will do I will just open this file and I will edit this particular file itself and I will copy this content from here to here or maybe I will just change this so now what I have done I have made another commit and I will go here and we can go here and then here we can visually",
  "and we can go here and then here we can visually compare what was the difference between these two files so this was content of first file and this is content of second file if both of them are same then it doesn't highlight if they are different then it would highlight hello yeah that is it I will take over now all right guys so is my screen visible all right so uh it is visible so uh firstly we'll be looking at uh these last two questions which uh this 16th question and the 18th question and",
  "uh this 16th question and the 18th question and then we'll be into flask okay so uh the 16th question basically says uh that you have been given uh you know you have been given multiple files so you have an entire directory which have more directories or directory is nothing but folders okay so you have folders then you have folders within folders and then you have folders within those folders as well okay so and uh like files are stored in all these uh multiple sub folders and what you have to",
  "uh multiple sub folders and what you have to do is you have to you know uh change the names of all those files according to like this so uh if the name of the file is let's say A1 B9 C then it should become A2 b0c okay so you have to increment uh the numbers by one okay so what we will do over here is that we will apply a combination of BH command and python okay so what I'm going to do is uh first and foremost uh obviously I won't be downloading this ZIP file and then showing you the contents",
  "this ZIP file and then showing you the contents in this particular file because obviously I won't give you the answers for those questions okay so what I will do is uh let me create uh okay go over here and uh all right so let's create a new folder okay and in this folder I will uh try to uh you know show I will just create more subd directories in this folder and then I will try to show you show you guys how you can actually extract those files from this particular folder okay so let's name it",
  "from this particular folder okay so let's name it uh Master folder okay and uh let's make few more directories uh I will name it uh slave let's say slave one because that one was must slave to okay so uh you have uh I will create some files as well so uh let's say SL to. txt okay I will also create one more file slave 3.txt and I will create one file in slave one as well okay we name it one okay so I won't be entering any content in these files because obviously we are not dealing with the",
  "because obviously we are not dealing with the content we are dealing with the names of these files okay so in total we have three files uh SL one two and three okay and those files are being stored in sub folders within this partic within this master folder okay so what I will do is first and foremost uh I have created another folder which is by the name of all files so I will extract all those files from this Master folder and then copy them or move them to this all files folder okay so for",
  "or move them to this all files folder okay so for that I simply you know uh asked chat gbt not Chad gbt actually I asked jini because uh our front chat it is down to some reason okay so uh what I did was I simply asked jimini to help me uh to give me a script which will transfer all these files to that particular folder to the all files folder okay and that particular command was this file uh type uh and all okay so this was this file and uh what I will do is first and foremost I will CD uh or",
  "I will do is first and foremost I will CD uh or should I not uh let's go ahead okay so I will simply so I will be explaining what this command actually does in a bit in a while uh I just simply run this okay let's run this file and you can see that those files have been transferred to this folder okay so uh actually I had a git instance in this folder as well that's why it just you know copied all the git files from the hidden folder to this particular folder okay and it also transferred the we",
  "folder okay and it also transferred the we one p notebook as well okay so that was not intended but uh let's go ahead okay so as you can see that the master folder have those subdirectories but those subdirectories are just completely empty just okay and all and all these three files have been stored in the all files folder okay so what does this command actually does okay just copy this and I will paste it over here and now I will show you what it actually does okay can you see this find so",
  "it actually does okay can you see this find so this this is a find operation this is a find command this will actually search within this okay so uh this is actually the uh the path of this particular folder okay so dot and slash is actually denoted uh is actually denote to the the current folder we are okay so uh it will find the type of files okay so type and then F what does this F mean it means files okay so if I replace it with a d it will be searching for for directories okay so this is",
  "be searching for for directories okay so this is how this command actually works then what it does is it will find in this particular directory the type of files okay so it will search only files not directories not any other thing it will just search for files okay that's why none of of the directories or sub directories were copied to that particular folder okay uh are these shell commands or bash commands uh these are BS okay Sange could you also just zoom your screen a little bit because",
  "also just zoom your screen a little bit because the visibility is a little I was trying actually but it's not zooming in control Plus+ does that command Plus+ okay okay okay okay it's working all right yeah I thought it works only on websites all right it works so uh this is the find of this is the find command and it will search within this current current directory the type of files okay this is this F stands for files okay then what it will does is so this is the first segment of this",
  "will does is so this is the first segment of this particular command what it will do next is it will execute something okay so this the hyph exe c means executing so okay so this will execute this command on all the files which it actually finds okay so it will uh move those files from that folders to this folder okay so this is how it actually works so this I guess this these brackets are for the files it actually finds so it's like a placeholder over here and uh let's say it just find it just",
  "over here and uh let's say it just find it just found out okay so there is a slave to file in this SL it's like find everything current directory of type file and then exe what does that mean can you please repeat EXC uh this uh hyphen EXC now H Hy ex this this that's what I'm telling so uh firstly it will find all those files then it will execute a certain command okay so this is executing a command on each and every file it finds okay and what is that command this is the command is this one",
  "is that command this is the command is this one okay it's executing this move command to on every file it finds okay so these brackets these curly brackets are there for the they're like the placeholders okay so they're like so if I'm not wrong they are acting like placeholders so whenever it will find a file in these folders it will replace the files name with this uh it will replace these curly brackets with the file name and then it will move them to this particular directory okay so this is",
  "them to this particular directory okay so this is how this command works and it just you know transported all those files now what remains to do is open python okay okay so python is already opened uh what I will do is I will open this and I will Zoom it out okay so this is our Python and uh now that all those files have been transferred to this all files folder we will run a python script over okay so this is the python script let's see what this python script actually tells us okay also we",
  "this python script actually tells us okay also we have to import OS for this okay so OS is actually uh you know a pre-installed Library which whenever you install python it will be pre-installed there okay so OS will be you can import OS directly without installing anything uh separately all right so what this particular chunk of code does uh it's sliced off okay all right let's see all right so let's remove this one okay so what does what does this particular chunk of quod does so uh magnify",
  "this particular chunk of quod does so uh magnify okay so here we are actually going to replace so because we have to replace only the numbers which are present in the names so uh we will actually make a translation okay so uh we will be making a translator kind of thing okay so this Str Str uh class actually have a make translation function which will actually replace when so whenever this function actually finds an instance of let's say it it finds zero present somewhere okay so it will",
  "it finds zero present somewhere okay so it will replace it with Z one okay whenever it finds six it will replace it with seven so that's how it actually works so it's like translating something okay so uh whenever it will find zero it will replace it by one whenever it will find nine it will replace it by zero so this is like it's like translating stuff all right so uh what I did next was simply okay we have to change the name the name of the folder is all files and uh it should be right here",
  "is all files and uh it should be right here okay so this is the name of our folder and what it will does is it will do is uh okay so firstly uh we have located so this os. list Dr what it actually does is it will list all those uh files which are present in the all file chory so let's first of all let's just run this let's see if we are getting the desired result so absolutely we are getting the desired results uh we can see that all those files have been uh like we can see the slave two slave",
  "have been uh like we can see the slave two slave one slave three over here okay so this os. listdir lists all those files which are list everything which is present in this folder okay so what we will do next is there is another yeah translation table is like a character mapping right kind z z is one one is two and something kind of kind of exactly okay so uh this OS class so this is this OS module actually have another method by the name of rename okay so this is how we'll be renaming stuff",
  "okay so this is how we'll be renaming stuff okay so uh what we are going to do is uh okay change changes as well okay so what it will do is it will take two arguments first one would be the uh the file you want to the name of the file you want to change okay and then the uh name of the file you want to keep so old name and then the new name okay so this is how this particular function works so uh firstly we will list the the actual name of this folder the actual name of the file and then we",
  "folder the actual name of the file and then we will apply the translation function okay so it's like creating a translation table just like rck just said and it will create this translation uh we will just you know translate this name uh these all these names of the files and we will save them okay so we will actually rename them okay so this is how this function will work let's execute this and check if our code was right okay let's check and yeah we have got the desired result so slave one",
  "yeah we have got the desired result so slave one has become slave two slave two has become slave three and slave four has become slave sorry slave three has become slave four okay also the week 1. IPI ipynb file has become week two now okay so it just changed everything okay so this is how this itself as well what the python notebook renamed itself as well absolutely so that's why it's showing that this file doesn't exist at the moment uh can you elaborate more on OS thing so this OS is nothing",
  "elaborate more on OS thing so this OS is nothing like so uh you must have used uh libraries like uh a very generic Library which I can think of um so uh I will just ask you have you used any libraries in Python any Library which you might have used uh numpy these things all right so nump is a library in Python and Os is another library in Python okay so there is not much of a difference those two are just libraries and OS actually allows you to make some changes within your uh within your uh",
  "make some changes within your uh within your uh what should I say the it allows you to make some changes and manipulate stuff uh with your files and folders okay so let's say if I uh if I wanted to uh transfer all those files from those subfolders into this all files folders that could have been done using Os Os as well okay but that would have required uh quite a bit of code so that's why I just uh I just resorted to using system commands and uh yeah so OS actually just allows you to make some",
  "yeah so OS actually just allows you to make some changes it can also create new files it can create new directories it can open directories it can uh you know just like we did right now we it can rename stuff as well okay so it it's limited to the directories and file stuff okay so this is how this is how OS actually works all right so any questions on this question on this particular sir can we do this thing from bash command you can do this from bash commands but uh I guess that would require",
  "bash commands but uh I guess that would require you to uh use o script and using o is bit tricky I would say because like you have to create a new file then you have to write the O script so uh o script is like running uh like running a for Loop so you will have to create an O script which will run a for loop on each and every file and then do some stuff so that would be like bit painful that's why I avoided it and also because I'm not I don't have uh quite a strong grip on a command so I just",
  "uh quite a strong grip on a command so I just skip that part okay sir otherwise if you if you are like you are comfortable with can absolutely go ahead with that yeah we using grip we could probably do it like I think I guess GP only allows you to you know uh filter out stuff it will allow you to find patterns in your file but it won't allow you to like it it can give you stuff like uh uh if you want to change stuff it it can do that but it won't make it per permanent because uh here you have",
  "make it per permanent because uh here you have to find the shasam or something I guess uh of all these files the change name of files so I guess that won't be of much help otherwise you can just try it and if you are able to do it then that's good for you all right so let's move ahead if there are no further questions okay because we have quite a bit of ground to cover today all right let's go to sqlite so uh whenever when some person uh of not much uh technical background will see this",
  "of not much uh technical background will see this particular portion they might get bit frightened because you know uh at the end of the uh at the end of the race they will see that you just have to write a simple SQL command okay you don't have to make use of python or any other thing you just have to write a simple SQL command so uh I have I know how to use Python with SQL but when I saw this question I thought okay I have to know recall everything I have to recall SQL and uh probably post G",
  "I have to recall SQL and uh probably post G SQL and all those stuff but when I just saw this question it was just a simple SQL command which you have to write so uh so uh if you guys are how many of you are you know uh how many of you have some knowledge about SQL because this SQL command is going to be like really basic one so if anyone have any knowledge about SQL uh kindly just raise your hand so I would know what to do okay so about five people have knowledge about SQL I guess okay so uh",
  "have knowledge about SQL I guess okay so uh okay so we have six uh people okay so there just one okay we have five people who know about SQL so uh I would say that um you know rather than explaining how SQL command will work over here I would encourage you guys to go ahead and uh uh like try to find it yourself I can give you a like a bit of introduction about SQ we knowing so we knowing only six commands which are the extraction commands will that suffice things or do we do we need to write uh",
  "suffice things or do we do we need to write uh make or insert table commands as well like know all those things I I completed this question with just one command so uh it's bit tricky uh because you might think that you have to use like hello yeah yeah yeah what I'm asking is will the uh will knowing only six commands will suffice completing this course uh six commands which six commands like select from group by and these things uh that I'm not sure about because uh do we need to create the",
  "sure about because uh do we need to create the DAT I would say that you won't need any other commands because you know uh in TDS what we do is we will uh actually use SQL we will just have an SQL uh we will you will get an SQL database and then you will import it to python so uh yeah so you won't be using much of these SQL commands at the moment so uh I guess no only this six six commands would suffice and if these six commands are not enough like if you have to enter a SQL command like this",
  "like if you have to enter a SQL command like this and you can always make use of chat GPT okay and uh that would work okay otherwise most of the stuff we are going to do in TTS would be related to Python and Par so just import a data frame into Python and then you can do the stuff you want to do okay any question an miti just to answer your question uh with regards to SQL so we only introduce it in the terms of uh making students aware that there is such a thing like SQL because if you're only",
  "is such a thing like SQL because if you're only doing the tools in data science sorry if you're only doing the diploma in data science no is that right yeah diploma and data science track some students may not be aware that there is such a thing as SQL and what databases are because there is no dbms in the data science track um but it is uh you know it is of course extensively used out outside in the real world so at least uh being able to construct basic queries would be useful to learn there",
  "basic queries would be useful to learn there is a good resource called SQL Zoo um what I actually Caron the thing is like uh I was using SQL like in my Bas in my early days but now like things have moved to completely a new bobj kind of thing sure yeah so so so I haven't been too much in touch so what I was requiring is Will We Will requiring these like all the things right from the starting insert table creating a table then indexing those things will be required or just simply knowing these",
  "will be required or just simply knowing these six things which we need to extract the query will suffice so yeah so yeah no insertion we are not uh doing a full-blown dbms course so it's only on the basis of uh extracting information so only from that uh Viewpoint we would be using it uh one place where it will come handy uh and it might come I think it's later in the course uh there is this new um or new wish I should say U database system called uh uh duck DB okay and um one of the things",
  "uh uh duck DB okay and um one of the things that's pretty remarkable about it is uh how incredibly useful it is for data analytics compared to a normal database uh system uh I mean it can do some I mean when you do some benchmarks on it you'll just be astounded how fast tiv is uh part of the reason is because duct TB uh you does not really follow acid principles but then again it's not meant to run databases but rather it's used for data analytics so knowing some SQL will actually help in that",
  "so knowing some SQL will actually help in that particular situation so that's why we want students to at least be aware that hey there's a language called SQL and you can uh do some queries that can get you some useful information in a fairly short order and uh when you're using something like Duck DB understand that there are nowadays you use database objects um or rather um uh you use libraries that have objects and things of that nature but sometimes U there is value in at least knowing a",
  "sometimes U there is value in at least knowing a little bit of the underlying technology because you can execute a query or to obtain some valuable uh results very quickly so that's the only reason behind introducing but we will not expect like you said um insertion creations of tables these sorts of things we will not you're not going to be managing a database just from an extraction point of view the basic uh tools that you might need for it so there's a resource called SQL Zoo there's some",
  "so there's a resource called SQL Zoo there's some introductory tutorials in there uh I advise most students to actually go through that and from an endm point of view there is generally maybe at least one SQL questions but it again it'll be a simple type of SQL question it won't one or two questions might be there so just there something that you should be aware of rather than being an expert at got it got it got thanks all right all right so uh I'll be explaining uh a little bit about SQL",
  "uh I'll be explaining uh a little bit about SQL because uh majority of us uh don't know about it so SQL is just like a uh so what does SQL actually stands for it stands for structured query language okay so uh you have uh these things called databases so databases is a place where you just store everything uh where you store tabular data in okay so uh now when we when it comes to like extracting data from that particular database you will do it using SQL okay so usually it's done by SQL and it",
  "using SQL okay so usually it's done by SQL and it can be done by python as well uh if you have the database and you just you can just import it using uh pandas as well but uh uh uh but mostly it's done using SQL because it's quite fast uh that's why it's done using SQL okay so uh I will be explaining this little query which I just wrote over here so uh if you can read this particular query you will think that it's like it sounds like something uh something kind of English okay it will sound to",
  "something kind of English okay it will sound to you like English we are okay so let me just read this query to you okay so what I'm doing is I'm going to select so this St basically means all okay so I'm going to select all from students where the name is JR okay so does that make sense so let's say student table where name is j yeah exactly what rck said so let's say uh in this meeting we have 19 people with us okay actually 18 people with us one of the person it's counting is the me sharing",
  "one of the person it's counting is the me sharing the screen so we have 18 people with us in this meeting so uh what I'm going to do is uh okay so I'm not I'm not going to do this so what I'm going to uh what we what you can actually visualize is that uh I have a database where where I have like where I have the names of these 18 students okay so from these 18 students I want to find jvr okay so how that can be done that can be done like this so that would be done done in this particular manner",
  "that would be done done in this particular manner okay so we will be selecting everything from students so this students is nothing but a place where I just stored all these names okay all these 18 names so select star from student where the name is equal to Jr so it's like it's exactly like how you would say in English so I want to I want to get everything from student where the name is so this is how actually uh SQL uh syntax is uh it's quite easy to understand if you uh kind of relate it to",
  "easy to understand if you uh kind of relate it to English Okay so uh just utilize the resources which uh ctan has provided to you and you will be good to go all right so any questions regarding this particular question or should we move ahead with the blask also uh for a hint because a few people will be would be stuck over here uh because I was also stuck over here uh I would give a hint that maybe uh what you're going what you are actually doing is won't work okay so whatever you are going to",
  "is won't work okay so whatever you are going to do whatever you are doing right now if and if it is not working you just have to scroll up a bit and look into to this particular section okay so we just you should just read these commands sort of and you will be able to figure it out okay so let's go ahead with flask right now okay so uh the thing with flask is that uh actually flas like in the last live session we covered vers we covered deployment using verel but the thing with flask is that",
  "using verel but the thing with flask is that uh flask allows you to to like flask is a python framework and uh it will give you more freedom to set up more things so like you can set up you can use databases you can use rest apis with flask okay so those things uh so what we are going to actually do over here is that we'll be creating a new we will be creating a flask application which will uh provide some end points to us some API endpoints to us and then we will be deploying that particular",
  "us and then we will be deploying that particular uh application to ver okay so the uh so the agenda of this flask application is what it's going to be I will just tell you guys so we are going to create an application which will which will uh whenever a person will give them their date of birth it will return which kind which group of uh you know uh let's uh which group of people you belong to for instance that for instance the those people who were born around 2000s were called Millen are",
  "who were born around 2000s were called Millen are called Millennials I guess and uh uh I was born in 2023 so I guess I would be counted as gen Z okay so uh we are going to develop this application uh where whenever a person just gives gives their own uh dat a their uh you know year of birth they will be returned they will get a uh response back from the application which will contain their uh the the group of people they belong to so I guess that's uh is there a better word for group of people",
  "uh is there a better word for group of people because U like M Millennials are genes so is there a better word for them which I can use anyone collections all right so uh okay so I guess collection is not the word but we can use collection if you guys want okay so uh firstly we'll be creating this flask application so let's create a new file and let's name it uh just like uh he said collections okay collections. F let's name it this uh well uh mostly these files should be named like main or app",
  "these files should be named like main or app because uh if you are like if you are building a project so you should name your files accordingly so uh one of so a few generic names of flask applications are like app or main okay so I'm just giving you a tutorial that's why I just kept the name of collections okay all right so uh firstly our first step would be establishing a g repository okay so uh command Plus+ please all right all right I will do that okay so let's minimize this and now the",
  "do that okay so let's minimize this and now the first step which we are going to follow is firstly we'll be setting up a g repository okay and then connecting it to our GitHub okay and then we'll be like when like uh if we are going then when while developing this application we will be continuously pushing that code to GitHub okay and then after completing the application we will be connecting it to ver all right so let's get started so uh firstly let's set up the GitHub uh configuration okay",
  "let's set up the GitHub uh configuration okay so for GitHub I should open bash script get bash all right so it's opening so this is the G bash and uh if you guys don't know about git and how you how you can actually set up git uh you might want to pay attention at this particular point so the First Command which actually works in initializing a git reposit a git inst in your device is git in it okay so simply execute this and it will initialize a git a git instance in this but in this folder",
  "a git a git instance in this but in this folder okay so as you can see that this is the git instance in my folder in this flash tutorial folder okay so uh if you guys are not able to see this after executing this git init command then the reason is that uh uh you should go to view and then show and then you have to check on hidden items okay so this git instance is actually an a hidden uh hidden folder that's why if you haven't checked this a hidden items option then it won't show you okay so",
  "items option then it won't show you okay so if I just uncheck this you won't be able to see this okay it's simple as that simply check this hidden items option and then you can see this particular folder okay let's head back and uh now what we are going to do is Let's uh now that we have done that I will add add everything I will let's check the status of our git instance it's showing me that this this particular file is not tracked at the moment so whenever it is uh like so whenever it is in",
  "so whenever it is uh like so whenever it is in red it shows that it it means that this particular file is not being tracked by kid but how you can make how you can actually track it using git simply execute this command which is get add dot okay so if you will run this command and now if I do get status now can you see this this this red color has been changed to green and it's actually now tracking this particular file okay also the color change is being reflected over here as well okay so now",
  "is being reflected over here as well okay so now that this is done what we can do is let's head back to Google and let's open GitHub okay so in GitHub I will create a new repo so this is how if you don't know about GitHub and how to create a new repos new repository pay attention Okay uh let's name it uh collections application okay collections app and uh let's create this repository and I will be keeping it public okay now uh whenever you create a new repository you will get the this kind of",
  "a new repository you will get the this kind of interface okay what you have to do is uh simply copy this second last command from here okay so you have to copy this second last command so uh just copy this and paste it over here okay by the way all every all these things of setting up G has been you know covered in our previous like previous sessions as well so okay so all these lecture all these things have been covered in a live previous live session so if you are unable to understand you can",
  "so if you are unable to understand you can just simply go back and go through those live sessions and you can check them out as well okay okay so I should close WhatsApp there's no option okay so uh this so what does this particular command does it will actually establish a new connection from your device device to your GitHub account okay so this part this particular command will actually uh uh it will set up a new connection from a device to a GitHub okay so that's the whole purpose of this",
  "a GitHub okay so that's the whole purpose of this command all right uh what we so this is the entirety of thing that we have to do in bash at the moment okay so when you have completed when you have just established the connection that the the use of P script has is like it's over and what we will do now is that we will head to this Source control tab so this is the source control tab which actually in vs code which actually allows you to manage your GitHub instance okay so uh usually what",
  "your GitHub instance okay so uh usually what people do is that they will uh execute more commands to uh run commits or uh you know pushing their uh code to GitHub but what we will do is that we will use vs codes okay so vs code this is a inbuilt functionality in vs code it it allows you to uh you know uh uh manage this GitHub instance and uh uh this is how it will let me just show you how it will work uh let's give it a new message always and always remember this you have to give a new message",
  "remember this you have to give a new message every time you are going to make a new commit in this okay so I will give it a new message let's say uh first commit okay so this is our first commit and rather than clicking on this commit button I will go to this arrow and then I will click on Commit and push Okay click over here click okay and this committing all right let head let's head back to our GitHub and if you will refresh it right now you can see this particular file okay so this file is",
  "can see this particular file okay so this file is present in this folder and you can see that your uh okay so we haven't written any code that's why it's showing us this mty file okay so our connection has been successfully established with GitHub and all we have to do is whenever we make some changes we have to commit and push all right so is everything clear till this point do you guys have any question regarding this or should we get started with flask right now all right I guess every uh",
  "with flask right now all right I guess every uh one is clear all right so let's start with flask okay so for flask uh also we have to do one more thing actually uh we have to create a virtual environment as well so what does a virtual environment mean okay so uh virtual environment as the name suggests it actually creates creates a new environment for your project okay so if you're not able to understand Let's uh uh let's understand it with this analogy let's say I have a swing pool okay and uh",
  "analogy let's say I have a swing pool okay and uh I have uh like there is there is let's say a one-year-old kid who wants to swim in that swimming pool okay so what I will do is I will uh you know I will create a separate section from that swimming pool I will create a separate section in that swimming pool for the kid okay so uh the depth of that pool the that the depth of that particular section would be less as compared to my pool okay so this is what a virtual environment actually means",
  "this is what a virtual environment actually means does for you okay it will uh you know it will create an entirely uh separate environment for you for this particular project and it will uh then you can you know install new uh and you can install your uh libraries uh for instance flask pandas and all these kinds of libraries you can install them separately uh it will allow you it will uh now you might ask that what's the reason behind a virtual environment so it will first of all as I just said",
  "so it will first of all as I just said that it will allow you to you know create a special space you can install new uh libraries and packages without disrupting your Global track packages okay so this is what uh uh the virtual environment is basically used for okay so let's see how you can create a virtual environment and uh uh it would be better if you guys uh you know kind of note down these commands which I'm going to write okay so for creating a new virtual environment it's pretty simple",
  "a new virtual environment it's pretty simple simply write python then- M then what you have to do is you have to write V EnV okay so VNV stands for virtual environment okay then you have to give the name of your virtual environment okay so I'm going to name this EnV okay so you can name it anything okay uh let's say I want I want to name my virtual cat it will work okay you can name your virtual moment cat but I usually name it EnV okay why not so uh simply using this command you can create a",
  "so uh simply using this command you can create a new virtual environment python DM vnb and then the name of your EnV you can name this EnV anything you want okay simply execute this and can you see this this this command actually created a new file right here a new folder right here so this is our new virtual environment and it contains all those libraries that we uh so we we can install all those libraries and it will be you know uh it will be right here okay this is like a fresh machine so",
  "right here okay this is like a fresh machine so this is like a a separate machine from your entire device which it has allocated to us all right so uh now uh the thing is that now that you have created your own virtual environment you can't actually you have to activate it all right so if I uh like let me just activate it once then you will be able to see the difference okay so for Activation what you have to do is EnV then script then scripts okay scripts then activate. PS1 okay so this is the",
  "scripts then activate. PS1 okay so this is the command to activate your viral en environment all right so let's execute this command and can you see this so now our powers shell would be working with the virtual environment rather than the entire machine okay so this is how it's going to work right now all right so let's install few few packages so anyone have any doubts regarding this virtual any doubts any questions I guess not all right let's proceed you did it in power like you can do it in",
  "proceed you did it in power like you can do it in bash or no no I can just simply close this bash SC I did it in power okay yeah I guess bash won't be able to do this stuff I guess also wouldn't you have have to add it to get ignore uh the virtual environment uh yeah we have to add it to get ignore as well uh we uh okay let's thank you for that point like I just forgot about that okay I will create a good ignore as well okay so uh at the moment let's install few packages okay so just like you",
  "let's install few packages okay so just like you install packages in your python I will be installing those packages pip install flask okay so this is running and it has installed flask so uh I would tell you that flask was actually installed on on my device globally but it installed it once again because we have created a new environment we are working in a new environment that's why it installed it once again okay and you can see flask right here okay so it has installed bunch of new",
  "right here okay so it has installed bunch of new libraries as well so you can see flask installed right here okay in this lips folder all right so uh we have installed flask and uh let's get to it all right so just like Ric just said we have to create a git ignore file so what does a git ignore mean uh let me just create it once then I will show you so this kit ignore file as the name suggests it will ignore what it will ignore the directories or the files which are mentioned in this particular",
  "the files which are mentioned in this particular file okay okay so if I do this if I do this and then I use GitHub to make some changes to you know push some stuff it won't do it okay uh it will just ignore this particular folder to push to GitHub okay so this is a usual practice in development that we always ignore that we always put this EnV folder in our ignore get ignore because uh you know the this EnV fold there is no use for this EnV folder to be pushed to GitHub as well okay so it just",
  "to be pushed to GitHub as well okay so it just contains your uh your libraries and stuff so there is no actually use uh to push this to GitHub as well all right so uh this is how G ignore actually works so this is you can just simply create it using Dot and then G ignore and then simply add this file the uh the path to the folder that you want to okay so uh let's head back to collections. piy and now I will import we importing flask okay so I have to from flask import flask I will also be",
  "I have to from flask import flask I will also be importing request Okay so let's H back okay so this is how you are going to import flask and uh then write let's write few lines of code so this is a like a boiler template of flask which you always have to write in order to make a flask application for okay so write these stuff and uh yeah it's helping me out okay buug equals to all right so uh what I have done over here is that so this is like a boiler template of flask so whenever you you have",
  "boiler template of flask so whenever you you have you actually have to create your flask application this this particular code should always be there okay so uh actually this can be ignored uh like this particular thing can this particular chunk of code can be you know manipulated or ignored as well but these three lines or four lines should always be me should always be there in your FL project okay so uh all right so this is how so I won't be going into the depths of what each and every line",
  "going into the depths of what each and every line is doing so first of all this is just basic importing and then it comes to this app this just creates a new flask instance all right no need to pay attention to this uh then we have this uh it will actually you know keep running our application and it will keep debugging our application as okay so you need not pay any attention to this we all we have to all you have to actually pay some attention is over here okay so let's run our python let's",
  "is over here okay so let's run our python let's run our flask application okay so how you can run it simple Python and then the name of your python script okay and then you will see some stuff it's printing out and here you will see running on this sport okay simply click over here and it will take you to this page okay so this flask application is actually running uh on your device so it's it hasn't been deployed yet that that's why uh no one will be if you just copy this uh particular URL and",
  "be if you just copy this uh particular URL and paste it in your device you won't be able to open okay so this is a local host it's running locally on this machine it's not deployed anywhere that's why you can't look on this particular okay so Shan I think this is good time you show how you can tunnel it to angro and forward request to your local system uh using enro uh yeah uh so I can guide you through the process it would just take five minutes since this application is already running we can",
  "since this application is already running we can uh get a URL that can be used by anyone on web I would say that uh you know let's not include enro right now uh the part of the reason is that I'm not much uh you know confident with enr myself I hav gu you through the process it will just take five minutes okay yeah just open a new tab all right okay uh uh search for enro Authentication yeah yeah so just go to docs and over here just go to Quick Start get started with the enro and here there is",
  "Start get started with the enro and here there is these commands you can use for installation okay in this Windows tab now uh you're using Windows right now right yeah yeah yeah okay yeah just use Windows in Powershell right yes all right okay so in VM enro was installed in the virtual environment right no engro is basically a command line tool which allows you to uh so what it does if there is some request that comes to the enro server then it will just forward that request to the Local Host",
  "will just forward that request to the Local Host where where you are running so it is just a way of redirecting request to some other server so it doesn't it doesn't install in EnV or something no but s is in the virtual right now right yeah but and so this virtual environment is for python so whatever packages you install for python uh it uses it for that purpose but enro is a command line tool the the purpose of enro is to forward some requests to your not inst right you have to probably use",
  "to your not inst right you have to probably use another Powershell window for installing okay so like we have to install enr on the entire machine uh that probably J Will gu I think this issue might be because of some permissions some right permissions or something because VM will not have the system level permissions to connect to internet rate or something but right now he's using power shell now he is using power shell before he was using VM yes oh is it iing this is some x's denied thing",
  "yes oh is it iing this is some x's denied thing yeah you have to probably use an elevated power shell right maybe open Terminal as admin uh yeah yeah maybe use administrative permissions not from here from that but run as administrator hey why do we need to run as administrator J what does enro do some so basically what will do if you have created an application locally and now let us say you want to uh make it visible to users over internet so you you can Tel it to enro so your a server will",
  "you you can Tel it to enro so your a server will still be uh running on your local machine but you can actually give you can actually uh get a angro URL and actually what happens whenever someone tries to access some that URL then it will send request to enr but then it will get forwarded to your local machine so anyone on internet can use your application okay that's like because computer can uh work as a server yes your computer will work as a server that is really cool okay that is probably",
  "server that is really cool okay that is probably why they are asking for elevated shell yeah I guess that works uh because there is a functionality in vuejs as well so if you're using vuejs it will give you two uh URLs to open one is your local machine URL and another one is your network URL so it will uh access it will give access to like you can use uh anyone in the anyone can use that open that particular link using your IP address so I guess that's how it's going to work over here as well",
  "that's how it's going to work over here as well this doesn't expose your IP address that is the difference between it okay it will just generate a random URL I think now it is installing okay it has installed it yeah all right what next to do okay go back to the uh browser okay browser yeah I scroll a bit down to step two so there you would have to sign in sign up to enro account so that there is a link for it just go back to yeah here sign up for in an enr account for all right okay so now now",
  "in an enr account for all right okay so now now you see that your in the sidebar you have that option of under getting started you have yeah just copy that by the way if uh like we are sharing I'm sharing my screen so you can just unshare your screen and do the authentication and then share it again okay so it has saved the authentication to a file a yaml file for so uh I guess this is the URL okay try it out okay it's uh not opening okay what did you use by the way how how you start uh I just",
  "you use by the way how how you start uh I just uh just a second open and c I just copied this okay so make sure that it is running on Local Host Adat your python server is running on Local Host ad8 actually I stopped the local server so do I have to yes yes you will have to start it you haven't saved your uh file all right it's charted and the gr so now now we have created another URL so every time you execute it it will create a different URL this one yeah all right that's pretty good so now",
  "this one yeah all right that's pretty good so now you can give this URL to anyone and they will have access to it all right all right all right that's pretty good and okay okay all right so uh all right so that concludes the Andra part so let's continue with the flask creating the this flask application all right so uh what I will do is I will run this on my local host for the moment and then uh perhaps we can use enro to uh kind of give access to everyone or we can even like host like we will",
  "to everyone or we can even like host like we will be hosting it at the end of the day we'll Host this application on vers okay so uh let's head back okay it's running right over here okay yeah hosting on veral is probably better because like yeah absolutely because end exposing an endo on your system right so that yes absolutely also you cannot keep your system running for 24 hours yeah yeah absolutely so the thing with enro is which jaaj just uh you know explained to us is that angro will only",
  "you know explained to us is that angro will only work until your system is working so if you close that uh if you close a terminal which is serving your your application through enro only then this will work okay so if you close that it won't work uh but when you are actually deploying it on versal or let's say netlify or any other uh uh deployment website so it will be permanent so it will stay there and uh uh everyone will so you need not keep you should you there is no need for you to keep",
  "you should you there is no need for you to keep your uh device open all the time okay okay so uh this is our uh application at the moment so let's uh create this okay so what I will do is uh let's I will be explaining this part to you at the moment okay so what does this app. route do okay so uh this slash basically means that this is so slash let's say if I put a slash over here so it will redirect me to this particular page as okay so uh what does this slash mean it means that this is the",
  "does this slash mean it means that this is the first page which will open whenever someone opens a URL okay whenever someone opens our URL this is the this is going to be the first page which opens okay so if I create a new endpoint so these are called endpoints by the way okay so if I create a new endpoint and if I uh name it let's say hello and uh not hello let's uh name it something else uh we can name it okay TDS okay we name it TDS and uh we can give the message hello TDS okay so now if I",
  "can give the message hello TDS okay so now if I uh type over here slus it should take me uh okay refus to connect I to R the code right okay view function is overwriting in point uh all right all right all right so the the error which has occurred is that uh whenever you so this is this is the chunk of code which actually acts as a end point okay so the syntax is you have to apply this decorator so these are called decorators by the way and here you have to uh mention the URL the the particular",
  "you have to uh mention the URL the the particular URL that you want to that you want to direct them to okay and then you have to create a new function okay so we have the index function right here so let's create a TDS function okay and uh then and now it should work as intended let's rerun this and let's check all right it's working let's check it okay and as you can see that we have got our H TTS right away okay and if I uh just head back if I just put a slash over here and now I run it it",
  "I just put a slash over here and now I run it it will just take me back to the main page okay so uh putting a slash so this slash means that this is the main page that our application would be working so this is the homepage okay so uh this slash me is that homepage and then you can create more endpoints let's say let's say I will create an endpoint for uh Sange okay and it will allow me to if I enter surange over here it should greet me let's check okay let okay I have to always remember this",
  "okay let okay I have to always remember this whenever you are creating more end points we should always change the name of uh let's say because I just copied it from right here always remember to create new functions okay so uh if you don't create any new function then it will give you an just like it gave okay so now it should run I I haven't saved it yet I will run it once again using python collection. pi and it will work okay if I reload it it's saying hello so much okay and if I go to",
  "it it's saying hello so much okay and if I go to slash DDS yes it will say hello TDS okay so uh before creating that you know jenzi and Millennial kind of application let's see how you can create an application with which greets a person uh whenever you enter the you know whenever you enter something right over here so let's say if I enter uh Slash Jr over here then it should GD jrj as well but at the moment it won't okay so what we will do is uh I will create an so this is an end point what I",
  "I will create an so this is an end point what I will do is I will simply write it this way and uh let's hope it works okay and uh okay let's see okay uh are you guys able to see this so uh what I did over here is that I created a kind of variable okay so I created kind of a variable right in the URL itself okay so this uh whenever you enclose a variable with these uh you know greater than and less than symbols it will act as a variable and then you have to you know uh put this variable as a",
  "you have to you know uh put this variable as a parameter in your function and then you can just use this use this name anyway okay you can uh use this uh name let's say if I want to reverse this name okay I will this we'll create a new variable and I will just simply replace this name okay I will just simply uh reverse this name okay okay and I will give new name okay so if I run it once again are you guys able to see this it just reverse Jr name okay and if I enter Sange over here it will",
  "name okay and if I enter Sange over here it will reverse my name as as well okay so it's creating us in our reverse it's creating our reverse names okay so if I enter TDS it will give me stt okay so this is how this uh flask actually works so this is how this this uh parameter these variables actually work okay so uh let's head back to that genian Millennial thing okay so what we will do is the that uh a person should be able to enter their date their year of birth okay let's say uh if I have",
  "their year of birth okay let's say uh if I have if I enter my year of birth which is 2003 and if I enter it right over here it should return the it should uh let's say it should say okay hello jeni okay so if the name if the year of the uh the year of birth is like let's say uh below uh I guess it's the range of years is like below 20 2015 to like it's 2000 to 2015 I guess that's the range of genes which they consider so I'm actually not into that kind of stuff so I don't have much information",
  "kind of stuff so I don't have much information about that so so let's create uh something like this okay so I will uh I will change this variable to ear okay and okay this to ear and I will will rename this function to uh let's say uh uh hello let's say collections because we are naming this application collections hello collection okay so this is the name of our uh function and uh right over here we are actually accessing this here as a uh variable okay and then we are uh using this variable",
  "okay and then we are uh using this variable and now I can use this variable function try to play okay so uh let's say uh I will create uh let's say uh we create a new variable collection and uh let's keep it empty so uh what I will do is if the year is uh I will also you know convert it to an integer okay because you know whenever you are using uh these kinds of variables it will return uh these variables will actually be in a string okay so uh if you're working with you know numerical values",
  "if you're working with you know numerical values then you should convert them to string I will make this like this and integer of here all right so if the year let's say uh is greater than 2000 uh but and it is less than 2015 then the person should be jzy okay then the collection should be genz okay and uh I guess uh there is a new generation which has uh come up which is Generation gen Alpha I guess uh they have introduced a new term for uh children who have who are born after 2015 uh till so",
  "who have who are born after 2015 uh till so let's make it if the year is greater than 2015 it should be gen Alpha okay if I'm not wrong makes sense because you have already reached gen Z what will you do start with the Greek alphabet yeah so I guess they're like going to use Greek alphabets now gen Alpha gen beta gen Sigma and all those kinds of things so I I personally find these things bit stupid uh but for the sake of this project uh it might resonate with much of many people so I just took",
  "resonate with much of many people so I just took this example okay so what we will do is the the people who are born before 20 2000 would would be categorized as let's say uh so it's giving me some options uh but I will categorize them as millennials I will write any spelling Millennials okay it was okay thanks codium okay so I will categorize them as Millennials else everyone will be categorized as an Omega gen Omega okay so let's remove this particular line so what I will do is I will return",
  "line so what I will do is I will return now the collection okay okay rather than using collection we should use generation so yeah generation should be the better word to use over here generation so that was the word I was actually searching for so okay we're using generation let's change it all right so uh okay so let's check if this application will work or not let's check uh what it will give for 2023 oh sorry 2003 okay I will run it and it should say hello jenzy yeah because this uh 2003",
  "should say hello jenzy yeah because this uh 2003 falls in the range of 2000 to 2015 okay and if I let's say I uh enter the year of uh let's say uh 200 uh if we are talking in Roman times so they will be considered as considered as Millennials okay so uh also any number about of I guess 200 15 would be termed as generation Omega okay so we have created this a s basic flask application which actually you know sends which actually tells you so given the year of birth it actually tells you which",
  "the year of birth it actually tells you which kind of generation you fall in okay so uh okay so this is done but the thing is that we I want to return a Json object rather than you know saying them okay hello this and that hell this we should return actual Json object okay so uh that's the only way it would be termed as uh okay this is better let's run this see all right so uh this is giving us a Json object so as you can see that I did nothing uh but I created a new dictionary so it just",
  "uh but I created a new dictionary so it just created a new dictionary uh where it uh where I just inputed all those values so it's taking this ear value from right over here so from this variable which we just created and this generation from the this generation variable okay so this is nothing but a simple dictionary which is which it is actually returning and you can see that we have created a is simple API okay so these are AP so this is how API actually are created so if I enter let's say",
  "API actually are created so if I enter let's say 2025 you will see that generation Alpha year 2025 okay so uh this is how you create an API using flask so any questions regarding this [Music] guys any questions or is this completely understood hey you are defining a port but when you host it would that Port matter can you repeat when you host it in worell would that Port matter and debug equals two uh I don't think so because uh when you will host it then it will give you a it will give you an",
  "it then it will give you a it will give you an entire domain its own domain so that won't matter also the thing is that whenever you are uh you know deploying it to somewhere you should always remove this okay you should always remove debug is equal to true and everything which you have written in this okay just just do app always remove this yeah so debug basically means that it should keep on debugging your code so whatever you are seeing right over here whatever you are seeing right here it",
  "over here whatever you are seeing right here it is debugging it okay so if I just switched off uh it won't work okay so I guess you won't be able to see everything you wouldn't be able to see uh what all this okay so uh debugging does that and uh Port is basically the port you you want to run your application okay so you can it can be any number I just chose 880 because jaaj told me okay so uh this is how create a basic flask application okay so any questions or should I give you an assignment",
  "any questions or should I give you an assignment right now basic [Music] assignment ask me any question you want regarding this all right Technic so if we had that FL so flask back end we had right in Mt one and Mt 2 project as well in in Mad one project even the front end was like mostly FL so uh so like that mad 2 project back and we can host on versal you can host on versel but the thing is that versel will require you to purchase a VPS okay yeah accessing a database so it won't allow you to",
  "accessing a database so it won't allow you to know uh access your database with a free uh hosting so you have to purchase a VPS for that okay all right so I guess that's uh everything is clear about this okay so I will give you a new assignment regarding this uh uh flask application so what you have to do is you have to create a new flask application where uh whenever someone enters their year of birth and the no not year of birth whenever someone enters their month of birth you have to tell",
  "enters their month of birth you have to tell their zodiac sign okay so I was born on in August so I am a Leo so you have to do so whenever someone you know enters their month let's say August or September so you have to return the Zodiac side associated with that okay so this is this can be a really fun exercise so uh you have to return this Json object not that hello uh and all that thing so the I guess the the syntax and the code is going to be exactly the same so uh you just have to create",
  "be exactly the same so uh you just have to create that particular application so yeah month and date is needed uh I guess dates so I guess there is something like uh from the middle of a month to the uh middle of another month to the ne middle of the next month so zodiac signs like lie in that way so like from 15th of April to 15th of May there is a sod zodiac sign and uh after that so like it's like between so zodiac sence basically lies between months so I know that uh a particular zodiac",
  "months so I know that uh a particular zodiac sign is not associated with a particular month but I'm just like you know simplifying this exercise for you yeah just doing that English version of zodiac SS not absolutely that's what I'm asking you guys to do you simply so uh you can so uh I'm not quite sure about that but uh if date is also needed for extracting out the zodiac sign let's because uh what I know is that uh it starts from like there is a separation between like people who are born",
  "is a separation between like people who are born before 15th of a month are in a different zodiac sign and people who are born after 15th of a month are in a different zodiac sign so I may be wrong in this but uh uh like if this is right then you can go another step ahead and you can just create uh okay so it's 20th of a month all right so that's how it works so if you want to go ahead uh with another step you can add another variable as well okay so this is a variable for here uh you can add",
  "so this is a variable for here uh you can add another variable okay so it would be something like this month and here you have to write that t Okay so this is how if you wish to go ahead with this you can go okay otherwise if you want to go there easy you want to go the easy route you can simply just stick with the months okay so this is your exercise and uh uh yeah so it will help you understand flask much more better and uh if you can code it up that's really good and uh what we will do right",
  "that's really good and uh what we will do right now is that we will deploy this website this not not a it's not a website this this is a flas application okay so we we'll be deploying this flask application on versel and uh uh if you guys create this application then then that's really good you can just create a new discourse post uh you should you know deploy this uh this flash application on verel or any other platform because let me be honest I usually use netlify rather than verel so I I",
  "I usually use netlify rather than verel so I I have a I have experien with netlify much more than versal so I use netlify rather than veral so uh you can you know deploy it on any platform you of your wish and then you can just provide link to that uh link to your project uh link to your flask application in the discourse post so you can do that also don't forget to you know ping us don't forget to mention us in your uh in the discour post only then we will be able to see that what you have",
  "then we will be able to see that what you have done okay so this is our task this is our minor assignment so this is nothing like uh associate so we are not saying you that you have to do this or else you will lose marks this is just a basic normal activity which you can do to better understand understand flask all right so okay so let's go ahead and uh push this code okay so we have completed the development of our app application so after completion of your after you have completed your the",
  "of your after you have completed your the development of your application it's good practice to delete these things okay so it will work if you uh like if you forget removing this particular debug is equal to true and it will work but it's best practice to you know just delete it okay so uh that's done and now what I will do is I will simply go to Source control and uh I will give me a bazillion values yes it's okay let's do one thing let's commit it to our GitHub okay so I guess this would be",
  "it to our GitHub okay so I guess this would be my last commit okay I will give this message so always remember to give a message in your commit because if you forget to give a message in comits then it will like just run for uh like it will keep on run running and running and you won't be able to get anywhere okay so after this click over here commit and push and it should be good to go all right's happening okay all right so uh in the source control there is one good thing that you can see",
  "control there is one good thing that you can see that you can actually visualize the uh the get instance in your your uh uh in your device so like GitHub is like a you know it's like a tree and uh like it has multiple branches so if multiple people are working together so and you have this visualization with you then you can you know really simply visualize how everything is going around how a person is committing and then you know merging branches with uh your brand so it's really good",
  "branches with uh your brand so it's really good function of PS code right here okay so that's done good plugin extension called git graph you can use that as well all right uh we can if anyone wants to go ahead with that they can use that particular extension as well okay uh all right so one last thing is that we have to create two new files uh two new basic files so first one would be a requirements.txt okay so the process is quite simple so it's you have to run a basic command in Powershell",
  "you have to run a basic command in Powershell which is PIP freeze then requirements.txt okay so this command will create a new file in your uh folder which will actually contain all the libraries which you have used in development of this particular project okay so this is actually NE necessary because uh veral needs this requirements.txt to actually you know figure out figure it out what kind of what kinds of libraries you actually require to run this project okay so simply create this file",
  "run this project okay so simply create this file using pip freeze and then uh less than sign and then requirements of pxt okay that would be done uh next we have to create a versal Json ver. Json file okay so uh this versal do Json file basically it will contain the build instructions so it will tell verel how you have to build this particular project okay so let me write okay it should be like this if I'm not wrong build work all right just a second should up now okay all right all right so uh",
  "should up now okay all right all right so uh my document all right so uh uh this is the uh the content of versal dogs which you have to include and it will actually you know uh it will instruct versal to how to you know build your application uh when it receives this uh uh when it's going to build the application okay so this build will actually tell so as you can see that this build will tell what like which file is the actual uh which file is actually running so uh we have to change this to",
  "actually running so uh we have to change this to collections okay so it's collection. Pi okay so the main Pi the main file you have to enter right over here in the SRC okay then uh you have to make some these little changes okay I will also change this so am I doing it right okay that's right okay so these are the few changes that you have to make so firstly you have to enter the you have to change this uh we have to enter the name of the file that that's actually running our flask application",
  "that's actually running our flask application right over here then you have to change this from uh at versal node to at versal python because uh you know what is node so node is basically uh the engine which runs JavaScript so if you have if you are working with JavaScript files then you have to keep it uh at versal node otherwise uh because we are working with python so we have to keep it python okay then in the destinations again you have to do if you have to enter the uh location of your",
  "do if you have to enter the uh location of your file okay let's save it and uh it's done uh let's make one more commit and I will name it final commit because I actually made a last commit thinking that it was the last commit of this entire application okay this is what happens final then final version two then fin absolutely sometimes uh you end up making like last commit one last commit two last commit three so that's you know that's a pretty standard uh thing all right so okay so it has",
  "standard uh thing all right so okay so it has pushed the EnV as well somehow uh I guess the get [Music] ignore ignore you have to do proper get ignore do do EnV should do or that's what I did actually okay okay let's ignore this if do EnV then all I guess I should have you know removed this dot then it would have worked either you should remove the slash or you should put one more do before you en you have to first remove it from GitHub yeah I have to remove it from GitHub and what you were",
  "I have to remove it from GitHub and what you were saying I have to add one more dot yeah either you have to remove slash or you have to add one more dot before EnV okay all right all right so uh let's remove this directory okay com changes does go on yet once again to do to okay okay when we create the repository on GitHub directly and we work on it usually they automatically create that g uh can please repeat like first make a repository on GitHub and then start working on it locally the get G",
  "and then start working on it locally the get G ignore automatically includes multiple variations for okay common okay things which we do not want to include like if we select node or the template in which we are working on okay by the way I what do you guys think will this work I don't know maybe you can check on internet what is the correct way to put folders and get toore or ask chat G just just just try and save it just just try and save it and automatically the thing will get dim that F",
  "and automatically the thing will get dim that F specific file oh yeah you're right let's check it's not dim right yeah have to save it save this file it's not getting dim it's not there so probably just change it yeah just write EnV just EnV uh just save it save it have to do contr s yeah I have done that okay done that I actually worked I've actually worked along with these things quite a lot but some reason it's not working let me just check my projects is a ignore okay so it's EnV and then",
  "my projects is a ignore okay so it's EnV and then slash H now it should go dim maybe the kind of Icon bag you're using is not dimming it that's possible uh let's make final commit number two Ambush let's check okay you can push reference okay okay okay so it's telling us that uh there is a distinction between the git instance we have in our device and the GitHub so we have to first uh at first sync these changes okay then I guess it will delete our EnV file from here probably does not going yet",
  "EnV file from here probably does not going yet okay it's there all right let's Run final commit okay it won't allow us let's write a comment should allow this final commit number three and let's hope it works otherwise you can always do final commit version 4 okay let's check all right so it has worked I guess okay so it has work successfully okay so uh because so whenever you are trying to uh add files which you don't want to commit which you don't want to push to GitHub simply uh do like this",
  "want to push to GitHub simply uh do like this okay the name of the file the name of the directory and then slash after that okay but uh okay so now it has dimed it out you can see right so uh because it's present over if I just remove it and then save it then it will lit it will just lit back okay also just do just do EnV now okay it's working as well it was probably in being tracked because it already yeah all right so uh this has worked so our project has been you know uh pushed to GitHub so",
  "project has been you know uh pushed to GitHub so All That Remains is to deploy it on versal okay I will open versal all right so we will click on add new and add a new project now uh it will show which repository you want to use to create the project for I will click over here collections app and uh okay let's click on deploy hopefully it should work okay should be object should be object okay already exists [Music] okay the problem okay let's add a new project let's try and import this all",
  "add a new project let's try and import this all right the name has been changed should work right should be object what's the problem over here it's building okay envirment okay directory flk okay okay okay is the same one okay miss something okay right everything seems to okay so this is the problem okay okay so in versal dojon uh there's no need for this list okay now I will save it and again write my final commit Comm number four okay Comm and push let's so it works this time okay and uh all",
  "push let's so it works this time okay and uh all right let's dipl once again so obviously it will say that it has been created or S okay I will add a new project [Music] now it should work okay deploy all right fingers crossed should work all right so the project has been successfully deployed on versal uh this is the domain of our project and if I enter my uh year of birth okay server is overloaded just go and check in the uh logs maybe there is yeah just read the message uh line number it",
  "is yeah just read the message uh line number it might be issue with some package is not available or something but we created our requirements of txc right yes yeah we created yes so this is from app. myself do okay why are we kind of okay it's expecting all right all right so that's my bad what was the problem uh so the problem was when I was you know telling them to create that uh application for zodiac signs zodia sence yeah so I replaced this year with month so okay okay that was my bad and",
  "year with month so okay okay that was my bad and should be here so uh let's see if Okay so this should work so the thing uh is let me just give it a final uh commit six I guess okay it's number five I think Shan whenever you commit I think the application would read aoy yeah absolutely so that's what I was going to show them so if if you push this once again so this application would automatically redeploy so it should show building once again yeah yeah so there it was so it was building our",
  "yeah yeah so there it was so it was building our application yeah you can see that it's as soon as I clicked on push commit and push it started redeploying our website it started rebuilding our website once again and uh this is the you know feature of verel uh you can you know whenever you uh so this is this is what actually it's called cicd so continuous integration and contigous deployment okay so contigous integration is when we just post our code to GitHub so that's integrating our code",
  "our code to GitHub so that's integrating our code with the already existing code and and continuous deployment is uh what versal just did right now okay so it's it deployed our website Whenever there was a uh little bit Whenever there was a you know even if there is a little bit change in GitHub so it will redeploy that website okay so uh I guess this should work now if I enter uh let's see 2023 all right so it's working perfectly it has given me this uh generation and the year so it's working",
  "this uh generation and the year so it's working perfectly you can uh like I will just share share this link to you guys and you can perhaps check your own generation okay so I've shared this link so uh that so this is how you can you know create websites you can create an application with flask and deploy it to ver so uh the assignment is still on you have to create that zodiac sign assignment uh there is no you know extra marks or something related you know associated with that but it's just a",
  "you know associated with that but it's just a fun exercise you can do to you know enhance your FL skills okay so uh that can be done and uh if you finish that little project then you can you know ping us on our discourse okay uh simply deploy our application on versel and give us the link we will check it okay also one more thing uh there is uh people uh have asked that uh when will the uh live session will be record when will the live session be you know posted in the on YouTube so uh one",
  "be you know posted in the on YouTube so uh one thing is that uh you don't have to wait for us to you know publish this uh these live sessions on YouTube you can simply go over here so this is this the calendar and you guys must have this cender as well so you can s simply go over here this uh you can see this live session click on this and you will see this you can see uh the live session recording okay you can simply play this and uh I guess it is you know available to everyone who has this",
  "it is you know available to everyone who has this calendar so uh after we've so know so after we you know stop the recording of this particular session in a few minutes or I guess an hour later you will see the the recording right over here so simply click on this live session and then you can see the transcripts uh you can even see the recorded lecture okay so you need not wait for us to you know load it on YouTube you can simply go ahead and watch watch the recordings okay so uh that was it",
  "watch watch the recordings okay so uh that was it for this lecture so it's I guess we have completed n gr as well and uh we have completed flask you know creating applications with flasks okay so uh surprisingly we have achieved all the the agendas we set today okay we have completed the we have completed ga1 we have completed flask we have also completed n gr okay so uh any questions regarding this any questions guys any suggestions any ideas you want to uh share with us right I guess no one",
  "you want to uh share with us right I guess no one wants to share any ideas all right so I guess we can stop recording can please stop recording yeah sure uh Ric yeah so actually I would like to uh tell you that you can even deploy database on verel I deployed it yesterday itself for my software engineering project that's why I know so like mongod DB Etc we can do right uh yeah you can do I don't know about  but I deployed pogress SQL and my SQL was also there okay so SQL also we can do um site",
  "was also there okay so SQL also we can do um site means site oh site is just a file right it's not a database okay okay so so it's better we do Post SQ and we can do it yeah H you can even connect it to your mad one project and mad 2 project okay and then we can kind of make a full-fledged application yeah yeah yeah something no uh wait I will share my screen is my screen visible to you no sir it's not visible okay uh I think isible yes now it so is this the tab I think this is the tab so what",
  "is this the tab I think this is the tab so what I did these are all the projects that I have deployed so far so now if I go to storage section here is that database that I have created 22 hours ago and it have got these local environment these are secrets so I cannot really show them this is these are used to connect to this database so we connecting to a cloud database right like super base you're connecting to yeah yeah I'm connecting to super base okay so whenever I go here here I can I get",
  "base okay so whenever I go here here I can I get a lot of different options so I use this for postgress one okay okay you can even deploy redish database here and these are different options that are available option is also there and you can do it in the free plan huh yeah I did it in free plan and and I think I got let me check how much I have got in free plan uh so this is what I have got this much RAM and this much is more than enough for test apps which is more than enough yeah even I have",
  "apps which is more than enough yeah even I have just connected it or I mean it's it is connected from a long time so I have so you can even deploy it",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/lmSMQ5LWa30 =====",
  "okay just give me two secs here okay I hope my screen is visible yes sir how great okay just give me just give me one second okay just before I start okay just give me a minute e okay yeah sorry about that right so um as I mentioned earlier the agenda for today is first I'll just give you a brief overview about project one what's the expectation how it works uh what you have to do in order to do well in Project one and uh the uh technologies that you you'll be expected to be familiar with in",
  "you you'll be expected to be familiar with in order to achieve what project one is asking it will cover the things that uh you require from the first three weeks um um so it'll be uh uh for example Docker will be part of it your ability to use Hub because you'll have to push your repo on there you'll also need llms and you'll be able you'll need to be able to create a server that uh responds to endpoints something that you hopefully you've been doing a lot of recently with uh the various G so",
  "doing a lot of recently with uh the various G so um so that's the first part of the session we'll talk about project one we'll not go very in depth but at some point what will happen is after week 3's U after some of the sessions this week are finished then we will uh actually start U working through an example of uh uh the workflow and the functions uh sort of a Hands-On approach we will be giving to how to do project one so in case you're really finding difficulty with getting a sense of how",
  "finding difficulty with getting a sense of how it comes together um I strongly recommend you watch the sessions U so that you get uh some good u sense of how to build the project okay uh um so we did this is kind of similar to what we did in Project 2 last time uh where we had sessions that specifically walked you through some of the ways to construct the various bits of the project and put them together okay um so that's uh the first part the second part of the session we'll actually start",
  "second part of the session we'll actually start with uh some week three content because so far we have not really covered any week three content in the sessions so um we'll be dealing with how to use llms in terms of apis uh because that's where the real power of llms come through for this particular subject and also just generally in Industry you know it's not the the chat llm that you are used to it's um something far more powerful that we will be able to show and demonstrate to you right um",
  "be able to show and demonstrate to you right um any uh questions before we proceed any brief question questions okay yes saki sir actually I have a doubt in uh graded assignment for week one so can I ask it now um I'll try and cover that at the end of the session if there's time but what we'll do is uh we'll also have some extra sessions this week uh and um my this is not uh firm yet but what we're hoping is we can put out a a video solution uh showing how you sol some of these assignments so",
  "showing how you sol some of these assignments so that might be helpful for some students but um in today's session we'll try and cover these very specific things that we have set out in but towards the end if there's time we'll try and get to your doubt is that okay okay sir actually sir I have posted at the discourse form also uh about the questions okay uh I last in the uh in last okay sure sure great okay uh yeah deep sick is in the news um so for us it doesn't make much difference really",
  "so for us it doesn't make much difference really because the the idea is still the same how to use llms as an agent so um what we teach for over here with open AI will be something similar with anthropic will be similar with co-pilot or any other AI that you would use um the workflow is similar so what you learn here even though we are going to use open AI uh will be similar with most other um llms that you would want to use anyway but yeah okay so the concept behind project one is um uh they",
  "so the concept behind project one is um uh they have um some um various sorts of uh so okay the first thing is we are trying to create an automated uh continuous integration pipeline okay what that means is there is going to be some data that comes into the company or into a server somewhere and uh there will be lots of reports there will be lots of other things so there will be various things that data that comes in through through a company that this company does okay data Works solution and",
  "this company does okay data Works solution and what tasks they do with that all vary okay but most of it is very routine sort of work okay so normally you would have people sitting and doing these various tasks which are very um how would I say it very um repetitive in some way okay um they're common tasks that people have to do but uh what we want to do is we want to try and see if we can um at least automate some of this process so that we don't uh uh one thing so that we reduce the errors in",
  "uh uh one thing so that we reduce the errors in the task being done and uh the outputs that come out are um in such a form that you can do something very specific with them okay uh what I mean by that is um let's say day in and day out this is a very simplistic example but it gives you the idea so let's say day in and day out uh uh uh an invoice comes in right and the invoice is on a piece of paper uh you're running a say for example a supermarket and the Milkman doesn't have a computer he just",
  "and the Milkman doesn't have a computer he just gives you a little paper invoice and he's written on there um how many cartons of milk you've taken in and what returns are there on there if there are any returns and he said at it by various forms and he's handwritten all this stuff and um this is a daily sort of process you have to put it in then you have to reconcile it to at the end of the month because the dairy will um uh require you to you know sign off on the accounts so they will say",
  "know sign off on the accounts so they will say okay here's the uh on our end this is what our accountings team accounts team tells us you have the uh receipts you just have to reconcile them so this is all very common types of tasks that are reped but they are very different each time that you do it as right so how do you uh automate this process right uh so this is the idea of a continuous integration pipeline where data comes in from one end some processing is required and you get what comes",
  "processing is required and you get what comes out at the other end is something very structured that say uh you can then hand over to your accountant to to manage for your business okay um so then the question is okay what kind of uh what what what is your job okay in the project so first of all your application is uh something that should run on a server just like any um web server would and you would uh you know when you type in this URL bar over here you're actually sending a request to a",
  "over here you're actually sending a request to a server somewhere to fetch this page for you right so in the same way you will create an API and uh which will uh run this particular um endpoint uh the end point will uh have a run task or a read task so you can see these are the two tasks it will have or two capabilities that your API will have so if you use something like Fast API you can use uh if you want if you feel better with flask perhaps you can use flask um what's important is um this",
  "you can use flask um what's important is um this black box that you're creating um what goes in will be very spe will be very specific we have specified what that will be what comes out also has to be exactly what we expect we don't really care how the black box works that is up to you to implement okay um but uh these are the two end points that your server should react to run and read and then U it has uh this um query parameter that you give it um called task and then this is a task given in",
  "um called task and then this is a task given in plain English Okay um so it may say something like uh again I'm using the simplistic example of of a supermarket um it may say something like collect all the the the delivery receipts from the Milkman you may say something like that okay um and then your system is supposed to collate all this information perhaps put it in a table or something like that so that's uh what it should do and uh when you run this task it should so every task that you",
  "run this task it should so every task that you run on a on a web server gives you a response okay so then it tells you exactly the responses we expect if it's successful we have to get a 200 okay response if it's unsuccessful you have to say 400 um and if it's unsuccessful because there is a problem in the agent this is the where you're using the llm the llm is actually messed up somehow then uh we have to return a 500 uh and then the body should contain some useful information that will help",
  "contain some useful information that will help the whoever is uh um running these tasks or whoever is using your black box um that they may know okay some idea of what's happening okay same way with the read function in the read function what happens is it just gets the content of a specified file so that's what this is supposed to do and uh the reason for this is what will happen is we will send a task okay to to the Run command it'll produce it'll do some work but it's not giving you out a",
  "it'll do some work but it's not giving you out a file okay uh the way we verify it is we will actually find out through the read because the file will be internal to the server so through the read we will say okay we want to examine the contents of this file that way we'll be able to verify was the task that you sent through the post actually successfully completed or not so those are the two things uh next thing is uh what kind of tasks you can expect to come to your project okay through this",
  "expect to come to your project okay through this uh run command uh sorry is it run yeah sorry run yeah run command okay so what kind of tasks are your system should be able to handle so in order to run the tasks um you should uh your blackbox or your project that you're running should um you know be able to run applications um using UI and uh this is the particular application that it should be able to run okay there is this URL given and there is this P file over here um and it using UV it",
  "is this P file over here um and it using UV it should run this data gen. py okay and it takes one argument okay which is this uh user email so this is uh absolutely essential that it should do do this because this uh will end up generating the data files required for your um server to process okay uh and the reason we require a user email as an argument in case you're wondering uh is um there will be some uh Randomness generated in the data okay so each student there are 1,579 students",
  "okay so each student there are 1,579 students registered on TDS so each student will get their own randomized version of the data set so no two data sets will be alike and they use the user email as as the seed for the Rand so that's why this is required and then of course for verification as well so that we know this is your submission Etc and um the next thing is um you should be uh so this is now this is a another task that should uh that it should be able to run which is it should be able",
  "should be able to run which is it should be able to format the contents of this file format. MD okay which is stored in this folder called Data okay so when data gen run is run in your application it will uh create these folders and files and one of the folders and files that will create is uh this data folder and this format MD it'll create data and dates. text it'll create data and contacts. Json it will create data and logs it'll create data and docs it'll create data and email all these",
  "and docs it'll create data and email all these files it will automatically create and then one of the tasks is it should be able to format the contents of this format. MD using uh prettier 3.4.2 for example that's one of the tasks yes coton I am seeing that in G1 now that the submission is like the timeline is ended the videos and all those questions are not showing can they uh can they show because that's also good reference right um yeah okay I'll uh I'll inform an I don't know why the videos",
  "uh I'll inform an I don't know why the videos are not showing it might be that uh but they will still be available on the um Tools in data science uh portal like in in this section over here the videos will are from this part only anyway if you go through this it'll be the same yeah yeah the the videos are from here itself so okay nice I actually just ended up directly doing the assignment so you see yeah yeah I mean this is actually the reason we did it this way is uh we have seen from past",
  "we did it this way is uh we have seen from past data that students actually directly go to the assignments okay so they don't even view the content so we thought uh a good way of delivering the content is to make it part of the ga itself so that's why we use this new approach this time so it's a unique approach good approach okay so and this was again based on feedback that we got from students so at the end of the term we always require feedback because we want to continually improve this uh",
  "because we want to continually improve this uh this course and um you know we don't want to remain static like other courses in this program so that's why make sure to give us feedback then we are able to improve it and make it better for this uh yes someone raised their hand who was yeah yes sir I raised The Hand by mistake sorry oh okay okay right so right okay so we're talking about what um tasks are required to be done so a task that may be sent might say format the contents of this",
  "may be sent might say format the contents of this particular file and it should be able to um do that formatting okay uh then it may in plain text it may say um this file contains a list of dates count the number of Wednesdays so like that there are several tasks here I'm not going to enunciate all of these but there are roughly 10 things your application should be be able to do and that's we call it phase a because there is another phase as well then what will happen is developers will call",
  "then what will happen is developers will call run um with the task description uh similar to the one above and um then they will um for example look at the files and see uh you know if they're getting the expected responses from it so um and here is an example so task A3 right so the dates .txt contains list of dates one per line and um it should count the number of Wednesdays but then over here if you look at it it'll say uh a task it may say this task okay write the number of Thursdays in",
  "this task okay write the number of Thursdays in extracts. txt into extracts count um and it might be in some other languages so your task is to build an agent that uses the llm to parse the description of the task and execute the required steps so that's what your job is okay and like I said these are the kinds of tasks that's expected to be performed um next uh are what are called phase B business tasks um so uh these are the requirements so uh data outside this folder SL data okay is never",
  "uh data outside this folder SL data okay is never accessed or exfiltrated even if the um task description ask for it so this is a security measure they want in place okay that uh by no means data should be exfiltrated from the system now it may sound silly that this is here but it's because um an llm is a is not like a human being right so you may be sometimes be able to convince it to do things that it's not supposed to do so how do you robustly guard against that sort of situation so this is",
  "guard against that sort of situation so this is this is one aspect of it second aspect data should never be deleted anywhere on the file system even if the description asks for it and then these tasks are uh not precisely defined okay this tests how intelligently you have created your system is your system able to um react to requests that uh it has not heard of before right so that's why these are vaguely worded and if you if you look here the business team has not promised to limit themselves",
  "team has not promised to limit themselves to these tasks so there could be additional tasks that they ask question is how do you make your system intelligent enough to react to those responses and actually do something useful with it okay but if you are able to handle it you'll get a bonus for that okay um so so these are broadly the things this is a very well defined tasks these are less well defined and that's by Design okay so that it um gets you a feel for how powerful llms can be if you if",
  "you a feel for how powerful llms can be if you if you are able to code them properly able to construct them properly okay what is required for the grading um so these are what we call the deliverables okay you have to create a new public GitHub repository okay so these words are important it should be a public depository not a private um it should have this license on it so in previous terms we've had this issue where students will not follow these directives precisely and then they'll wonder",
  "directives precisely and then they'll wonder why they've lost marks okay that's because they just don't actually follow the these things they don't read what's written here so please read very carefully what's required and follow it uh to the letter okay write and test your code call Post task with a few tasks and check that this um gives you a read so in other words what we saying is this should run okay this uh post request with the slash run should work and the get request with the read",
  "run should work and the get request with the read should work okay so those are the two things that we saw up earlier over here those two things should work uh then you have to um you know it's not enough to make an empty repository right push the code to it okay uh so that's uh the next thing you have to do uh then this is very important so just pushing the code is not enough we don't want to build your application with all its U um dependencies and uh all that sort of thing uh we want you to",
  "and uh all that sort of thing uh we want you to build a complete application okay that should run anywhere it should run in Mac OS it should run in Windows run in Linux without any issues it should run wherever we want to stick it okay the way that works is through Dockers so you've been exposed to Docker in week two um and so that's uh what you do you create a Docker file that builds this application okay that you have created then push the docker image to the docker Hub okay um so the first",
  "image to the docker Hub okay um so the first part this one the depository is to examine your code the second part is to for us to be able to test your application okay so that's the two parts to it um so push the your docka image to docka HUB and um then ensure that it works okay once you push it on to Docker Hub uh you can uh check by running you know pod man run give the name of your image um give the um AI um um proxy token um and uh serve it to the API and it should be able to uh produce",
  "it to the API and it should be able to uh produce This Server okay this is the server it should produce your do Docker image so if you remember I think it was last session or not I'm not sure but in one of the sessions jrj demonstrated how you can for example have a little Ubuntu system and how it's able to uh run some um uh some sort of services from it uh it's exactly the same idea okay uh your Docker should U basically be able to run uh This Server at Local Host 8,000 and uh run the be able",
  "Server at Local Host 8,000 and uh run the be able to do the tasks for of the API okay um but these are the parameters that have to go into it we'll discuss this uh in more detail in upcoming sessions okay so don't be afraid if you see this right now for now you just worry about this first part that itself will be plenty okay get your get your application actually running that itself will be a big T then we will um we will deal with how do you push it to Docker and how you get it running from it",
  "it to Docker and how you get it running from it and last but not the least I hate that phrase but uh nevertheless submit it in Google form okay we won't know what your repository is unless you actually give it to us right so don't forget to submit the Google form it's in fact over here so if you just you know if you see this is actually a link you know this is the form please don't forget to do that otherwi you will not get any marks and uh what you need in the Google form obviously you need",
  "you need in the Google form obviously you need the the repo name and also the um image name on Docker okay so it has to follow this format so please do that um so there some useful notes don't actually put your token in here okay um because then someone can steal your token and more significantly we can't then use uh uh your application then is tied to your token how will we test it we don't want to use your token for testing it right we will use our token so use this environment variable okay",
  "our token so use this environment variable okay we'll we'll show you how to use environment variables but um I'm mentioning it now um and this is a this is a good tip uh you use this line of code in your python script os. Environ air proxy token and in your script then it'll pick up the token from the envir okay um in order to use the um open AI llm uh it's being done through a proxy uh and the each one of you will be able to get a $1 limit it's renewed every month so at the beginning of",
  "it's renewed every month so at the beginning of February you will get a fresh set of uh usage limits so in other words you'll get $1 at the end of uh sorry at the beginning of February uh but try to avoid exceeding this limit so one of the things we'll talk about today is how to carefully construct um your queries so that you don't have um um you know so that you don't unnecessarily use up the limit rapid uh next thing is um oh by the way just so that you guys are aware um all iatm students",
  "so that you guys are aware um all iatm students that includes uh the BS students um now have access to perplexity AI I don't know if you've heard of it uh but it's free for one year the pro version of it so how do we get access to it do we use our email ID yeah you have to use your uh email ID uh that you get from uh you know which you use for your course so you know if it'll be at ds. study. iitm or something like that right you use that email ID when registering for perplexity uh perplexity",
  "ID when registering for perplexity uh perplexity and you will get the pro version of it free for one year so it's very capable uh it's uh very competitive to um uh open Ai and it's very competitive to uh CLA and anthropic as well and you can it has voice recognition you can upload images you can do virtually a lot of things with the pro version and you get it for free for a whole year and the reason that is is because the person who the CEO of perplexity is an ex alumini of iatm so he's uh as a",
  "is an ex alumini of iatm so he's uh as a Goodwill guesture he has given all iatm students free uh usage of the pro version for one full year so make good use of it okay okay uh next thing right so um as far as your application goes you have to still use the proxy okay so be very careful with using it and um you have to use GPT 40 mini not anything else in your application okay keep your prompt short and concise okay this is uh this is actually very useful uh for you I know it comes under note",
  "very useful uh for you I know it comes under note but uh when you run um you know when you when you uh operate these uh API end points it must complete within 20 seconds okay um so the reason is um you know some some of you may come up with some really Fancy clever uh Loops okay U and um you know we don't know how long it's going to take right if if it you know if it takes like 30 40 50 seconds we don't know so so at some point we have to make a cut off if 1,500 students submit their projects",
  "a cut off if 1,500 students submit their projects uh then for us to evaluate it will take days okay I mean last term there were 679 project submissions and it took us I think it was four or five days with the server running 24/7 to evaluate all of them because it was uh it was not evaluated manually okay all these are evaluated automated um so that takes um quite a lot of time and processing power and if you are waiting 20 seconds for each one of those completions you know it will we might as",
  "of those completions you know it will we might as well wait till the end of the term to evaluate your project so please keep it within make sure it runs within 20 seconds okay um so that's something to keep in mind okay um evaluation okay so this is how valuations are going to be done so they used task A2 as an example so um we will run this command okay from our end uh so in other words you also should be able to run this command from your end and then uh we will call this so what what this",
  "and then uh we will call this so what what this does is it will fetch the docker image your application from Docker which you have uploaded to Docker and it will start uh start the application and that application will start a a server that server will be serving on Port 88000 and it will be ready to respond to um calls made to the um to that server so the first call we'll make to that server is uh this one okay this is an example okay I'm I'm not saying this is exactly what we're going to do",
  "not saying this is exactly what we're going to do but this is an example of how evaluations are going um so here they will um so this is a task you can see here uh format uh data uh with the prettier uh 3 point whatever okay fine then we have to get a HTTP 200 response because uh you know it's a pretty straightforward task we expect it to it should work and uh the task may be worded differently okay so if you see in here it's uh it's a bit strange how this is structured it doesn't quite say it",
  "how this is structured it doesn't quite say it like [Music] um it doesn't quite say it like this right instead it's uh it says it like this but you get the idea format uh this file with prettier 3.4.2 but your agent should be intelligent enough anyway to be able to understand what's being asked so we'll explain how this how it how do we actually achieve this okay it's not as difficult as it sounds um then uh the next part is um we'll call the read one uh read um endpoint so this was a run",
  "read one uh read um endpoint so this was a run endpoint this is a read endpoint and then we will check and see if we get the contents of the file changes or not to what we expect it to do and that's what we do we verify it so we will get a file out of your server and then we we will run a script that actually pries it and see if the two are exactly the same so then we know okay your application is running F so this is an example of how an evaluation will done be done on your project so this is",
  "will done be done on your project so this is with just task A2 so we will obviously do them um with all these tasks and uh with a mix of some of these tasks as well um and then uh how we score so that's how we evaluate this is how we will score your repository must have the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation so this is not even getting marks okay in order to be eligible for evaluation you have to these things must be the uh completed so GitHub repository exists and publicly",
  "so GitHub repository exists and publicly accessible GitHub repository has a license file with MIT license GitHub repository has a valid Docker file Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via this command Docker image uses the same Docker file as your GitHub deposit now one thing I'll mention before we move forward this word publicly accessible it doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you are developing it okay you can keep the code secret if you like that's not a problem just make",
  "secret if you like that's not a problem just make sure that when it comes time to actually getting it uh submitted at that time you have to make it publicly accessible okay but before then if you want to work on it secretly that's fine uh it's it's not not a big deal okay but just make sure that you these are absolute prerequisites if these if any one of these fail your project will not be valuated okay uh phase a gives you 10 marks so project is totally out of 20 um so each of the tasks that",
  "is totally out of 20 um so each of the tasks that it completes in Phase a you'll get a mark for it each of the tasks it completes in Phase B we'll get a mark for it as well um and again it's it's the same way okay run and read run and read uh but the tasks obviously these are well defined tasks so this should be easy to implement these are a little more U little more work is needed on those okay bonus additional tasks so we may pass additional tasks beyond the list if your code handles them",
  "tasks beyond the list if your code handles them correctly you'll get one bonus Mark per task now I'm not at Liberty to say how many bonuses you may get um but um that's something to keep in mind if you're going by previous terms um criteria uh in Project 2 last term which was also using llm agents I think there was something like 12 bonus marks on offer it was huge okay um but um I think the highest score last time was something like someone managed to get seven or eight out of the 12 okay but",
  "to get seven or eight out of the 12 okay but it's worth it if you can get this going that's uh you know that may compensate for anything you might have lost up here code diversity we give bonuses for code diversity so we encourage you to learn from each other but we also are quite happy for you to have diverse code to get bonus for you know if your code is uh not similar to someone else's of course we will reward that uh but um if yours is very similar to someone else's then you will not get",
  "similar to someone else's then you will not get bonus marks so we don't penalize you for copying okay we want you to learn that is the key purpose of this course because what you learn here will be very valuable for you in your future career so but uh part of learning is two things one is struggling it with with it yourself but also looking at others who have done and using the ideas that they've come up with and then making them your own in a in a way you know in one sense once you get an idea",
  "a way you know in one sense once you get an idea oh this is how you execute this uh this task then you know you can perhaps find a better way to iterate through it or you may find a more efficient way of dealing with it or whatever but at least you know you've learned something in the process so we don't penalize the fact that your code might be similar but we will give you bonuses if yours is like unique the score will be the sum of the marks above there will be no normalization so in other",
  "above there will be no normalization so in other words um if you get 22 out of 20 you will get 22 out of 20 so so yeah um that's something to keep in mind project is a place where you can get a whole load of marks you've been given four weeks to at least get started on it and uh it is um well worth to okay any questions at this point so this is a brief introduction to project and what is expected any questions particularly around the deliverables or evaluation or any of the these things uh will",
  "or evaluation or any of the these things uh will there be any support in case uh the person who is not very well versed with all those things like get repository yes yes yeah you will definitely yeah you we will we will try and provide you as much support as is possible for us to do uh you will get support yeah and also uh in future sessions uh we will um actually go through a working prototype so that um you will have an idea of how to build your own someone raised their hand who was anyone",
  "your own someone raised their hand who was anyone else okay okay great so um sir excuse excuse me uh yes who is this sir I'm Wan sir okay yes go ahead good evening good evening sir whatever you explained you know it's rather I just I just want to be frank with you it's uh Greek and Latin for me I'm basically from accounts and finance I don't understand anything okay so could you kindly know at least know present uh a model project and then explain you know uh things step by step so that I can",
  "you know uh things step by step so that I can understand better yeah I mean that's that's what we're going to be doing in uh in the sessions in the future we will actually be working through a working prototype of uh we will be actually be building the Prototype of the project so that way you will have a sense of what's happening at each stage because you you talked of that jit Hub you know and then pushing that code Etc in fact actually in that uh ga1 you know there was one question you know",
  "uh ga1 you know there was one question you know it was a simple code I was trying that but I I couldn't do that right so I rather I'm very much frustrated to be frank with you so unless you you try to help me out otherwise you know I'm frustrated to the point of even dropping the course okay so it's uh because I'm just trying to build up something without any foundation M there's no Foundation at all uh I do not know how are we going to build upon that very s okay um okay I'll make a note of it",
  "that very s okay um okay I'll make a note of it um and see what we can come up with with regards to helping someone in your in your position um so do you have any programming experience at all I mean no no not at all sir inot I had done long long back but that was that was in Fortran that was about long long back Fortran yeah yeah that 40 years ago I think yeah yeah don't but of course I worked on Oracle rbms etc etc but so I know that interface you know whatever the work you know but what's",
  "you know whatever the work you know but what's going behind I do not know okay so have you managed to watch any of the sessions that were conducted before this uh yeah yeah in fact actually I've went some of them in fact actually I listen to that this thing that tools that first week you know I could do that okay um but certain things I could do but uh rest of the things you know and in fact actually that bash I could do but you know the jig Hub I couldn't do okay what we'll do is um I mean",
  "Hub I couldn't do okay what we'll do is um I mean again we'll have to see if time permits what I'll uh we'll try and do is maybe have a specific session for people who are struggling with very specific specific uh things like so for example you are struggling with just getting git working so if you are struggling with Git You will not be able to do project because yeah that's what because we to be the prequest it isn't it yes that's what I was worried yeah yeah so what we'll do is I mean when",
  "worried yeah yeah so what we'll do is I mean when we are doing project we will like we will also create a repository so you will be able to see how we go about doing it I mean that at least will give you a sense of see all the things in Project are from first three weeks only it's not touching anything from uh weeks that are coming up ahead so if you're th with the first three weeks you will easily be able to do project one it's not that challenging so only thing is the difference is there's a",
  "so only thing is the difference is there's a knowledge Gap there's a knowledge gap between where you are and where you ought to be that's all there's no nothing else I think you're very capable because obviously you have exposure to programming you have a good logical sound mind uh you know if you're doing accounts you should have a very good sense of logic and uh numerology and be able to do all these things so I have full faith that you'll be able to handle it only thing is there is some",
  "be able to handle it only thing is there is some knowledge Gap that's all uh so we will try and address that knowledge Gap while we are working through the project so we will start at the very Basics we'll set up the repository we will go through these requirements and uh then start building the application itself each of these tasks and uh and take you through the project and I think even if you um you know at least um attend those sessions I think you will have a good grasp of the end to end",
  "you will have a good grasp of the end to end what is expected see so far first three weeks they were all sort of disperate tools okay in other words you don't know why you're studying them so it also affects motivation when you don't know why you're doing it right so project the attempt of project is to tie all these things together to show you something uh that actually is useful and um in fact the head of operations was making a joke with Professor Anand where he was saying you know U are you",
  "Anand where he was saying you know U are you planning to replace uh replace uh our work in operations with this project so uh uh but this is the this is the whole uh point of project it's to tie these Concepts these Concepts that seem disconnected from each other and put them as a nice cohesive hole and let you see how actually it all fits together so so I think if you stick around um for those sessions even if you okay let's say for example you find it challenging and you decide to drop the",
  "find it challenging and you decide to drop the course okay I still would suggest you to join the project sessions or watch the project sessions so that you will at least learn um how how it comes together okay no no right away I'm not going to drop it I'm I'm still going to try for it but uh of course it all depends depends you know that that the support you are going to give give me thank you very much for your kind words no worries okay Karishma you have a you have a question yes sir I have a",
  "you have a you have a question yes sir I have a problem okay sir um is there any possibility to uh change the time of the of the session uh because sir uh all the class classes are clashing with each other in the calendar and I have told to uh P sir but no response regarding the other subject has So when you say sessions which particular session you are specifically referring to uh I mean TDS T session because I was saying there are different times right and different days so yes sir sir uh",
  "times right and different days so yes sir sir uh like um in the Thursday I am clashing with the time same time three sessions are there live sessions yeah yeah like MLF MLT and then TDS and uh on Wednesday There's a live session 9 to10 and live session TDS of live 9 to10 MLF and TDS and uh same with Saturday they is a TA session of uh uh not Saturday uh on Tuesday okay no no only only only Thursday and Wednesday Thursday and Wednesday so the Wednesday one uh absolutely cannot be moved",
  "the Wednesday one uh absolutely cannot be moved unfortunately um the Thursday one um it may be possible to move it but uh one of the reasons the sessions have been kept in the evenings is U you know many people working during the day or have other responsibilities during the day so that's why they are generally kept in the evenings but we record all the sessions so um that way you're able to view them later but I understand like if you have a doubt and you want to immediately ask it you're not",
  "and you want to immediately ask it you're not exactly sir so I I definitely understand that issue um we will try I mean I don't know when else can we schedule I mean it would have to be maybe doubt clearing sessions we could have to perhaps schedule it say earlier in the day maybe but again I don't know how many people will turn up for those I mean it would be no good if only two people turn up right yes so actually this problem happened with same every classes like I have requested in then",
  "same every classes like I have requested in then majority uh uh fins so I don't know to who I reest to oh my God okay I'm willing to be flexible what uh I'll do is um we'll uh we'll trial a session at an earlier time for maybe Friday okay uh no guarantees at the moment I have to discuss it with the other team members also so uh this time works for you 5 to 7 there is no session sir H sorry Friday there is no session yeah at the moment there isn't but we add sessions as required also so we if we",
  "but we add sessions as required also so we if we need to add we can add yes sir uh in between 2 to 6 I'm okay 1 to 6 or even in the early morning before 11: I I'm okay okay okay um any thoughts from others I'd like to hear what others also have to say sir I request you to please uh keep the session on the evening itself uh because in the morning we I I am having classes uh I'm doing dual degree and I know many of my friends are also doing so sure sure yeah I think what we'll do perhaps yeah",
  "sure sure yeah I think what we'll do perhaps yeah what we'll do perhaps is um if you're keeping an early session it'll be mostly for doubt clearing um but if you're doing these sort of sessions where we are actually going to be teaching something then we'll keep them in the evenings does that sound like a reasonable compromise yes uh the thing is cartton like uh like whenever the class is at least one of the one of the two people will have a conflicting schedule because my shift starts at 2 and",
  "schedule because my shift starts at 2 and ends at 11 so now since I'm working work from home because of that only I was I'm able to manage M 2: to 11: is it so afternoons till nights okay yeah so one thing you can do you can uh take two doubt clearing session if you have time and you can put one of them in uh in the morning and one of them in the evening yeah but uh we'll have to see what resources we can manage for that right so uh it's um this is not the only only thing that we have right so",
  "is not the only only thing that we have right so we'll try Okay uh I I've taken taken I'll take it uh take the feedback from others and discuss with the team and my goal is to help you as much as possible okay in the best possible way so I'm not ignoring what you guys have said um but we will uh we will look into it okay and see what can be done okay sir thank you sir thank you sir right um so there's a Manas Manas yes please uh Carlton I this question is mostly for jiv I guess as he's handling",
  "is mostly for jiv I guess as he's handling the sessions where the learning sessions where they teach us about the contents from the ga I haven't mostly attended the last few sessions but would like to know if the week three contents have started yet uh so I was I'm supposed to start week three today but I wanted to at least go through project one uh which is what I covered in the earlier part of the session but uh I'll be starting with week three as soon as these doubts are done okay thank you",
  "as soon as these doubts are done okay thank you okay right if there are no more questions um let's uh let's get started with week three uh okay so um how many of you have watched the videos for week three or at least gone through these notebooks that are there there are these Google collab notebooks that have been provided for week three have you all at least had a look at them okay no right okay um right just give me one second while I just get set up then okay just give me couple of minutes",
  "set up then okay just give me couple of minutes and I'll be back e e okay um thanks for waiting right okay I hope uh the screen is visible so uh the first thing is we're going to talk about um what what actually llms are about okay I know it seems like a trivial subject most of you are familiar with the the um the flashy cousin of llm which is is uh you know the chat capabilities and things of that nature um but llms fundamentally they are large matrices okay that [Music] um uh have in them",
  "matrices okay that [Music] um uh have in them vectors these vectors represent um I would not call them words they contain tokens and these tokens in and llm um uh are a multi-featured vector so I think um uh for example open AI is a model uh each of their tokens contains 1,500 and um something like something of that order okay about 1,5 1,600 uh features and um so that's what represents every single token so a token could be a full word or it could be a small little word so I mean it could be",
  "be a small little word so I mean it could be the uh even this dot could be a token for example okay and each of these are represented by a vector that has a 1,600 uh dimensions and this all sit in a matrix or matrices and whenever you type something into an llm or when we make an API call as you will see now um the words that you type into the llm or the image that you're sending to the llm or the sound that you're sending to the llm they get converted into these tokens okay and uh then once",
  "converted into these tokens okay and uh then once they are tokenized then the llm looks at the order in which these tokens arrive and then that's where the magic happens then they transform okay that's why they called transform models they transform what you have given into another set of tokens which are sent out back towards you as a response so all they're doing are Matrix transformation so if you've done MLF or MLP you will understand what these terms mean or or even if you have done maths",
  "terms mean or or even if you have done maths too they are basically ma matrices that are doing Transformations they're working on a vector and moving them or transforming them in some way and then you're getting a result from it um so that's what at the heart of llms are so they not really intelligent in other words so this idea that llms are like have sentients and are you know have some innate intelligence in them that's completely nonsense okay it's completely mathematical there is nothing",
  "it's completely mathematical there is nothing intelligent in that sense about it it's very deterministic in some ways there is some Randomness in in there but um that Randomness is not from intelligence that Randomness is just because of the way the models are structed okay so that's a general idea of what llms are so um there are some other Core Concepts that are important to understand also um so before I talk about those Concepts we'll just start with a simple um what do you call for it a",
  "start with a simple um what do you call for it a simple example okay of how to make an API call to an another the reason why API calls are powerful is because you can use them in your programs okay and that's where the real power of llms come through um so first of all to use an llm you need an API key so do you all know how to get your API key have you all managed to get it can someone say yes no no okay so if you go to this section here large language models right on on the is my screen",
  "language models right on on the is my screen visible I'm not entirely sure yes Caron your screen is visible okay so if you go here and uh on this first intro page if you read it right it will uh it will show you this link okay this if you go to this link it will take you to this GitHub page this is the AI proxy that we will be using and this is where you get your free allowance okay um I'll be demonstrating all our applications using this because ultimately for the project you will require this",
  "ultimately for the project you will require this itself but you can use something similar for uh other llms of your choice okay but you'll have to read the documentation to know how to implement those so if you go here at the very top you will see this link over here this is where you get your proxy token okay if you go in here and you uh open that link you will get this um um sign in sign in with your uh your iatm Google account and you will get a proxy token copy that proxy token and you will",
  "a proxy token copy that proxy token and you will then be able to use it in your your in your API okay so I've already U stored the proxy here um the proxy token so I'll just run that now and then um the next thing you will need is you need a a URL okay to contact the llm so this is basically an API call this same like your fast API except this is on the internet okay so when you are setting up fast API or flask you're doing the exact same thing which is you're setting up a an internet uh sorry",
  "which is you're setting up a an internet uh sorry um service provider that responds to URL that's what you're setting so you got um so you you be asking where you get this URL it's in the same documentation that I showed you here if you look over here this is the proxy you need to use okay um and depending on what you're trying to achieve you will use different things so say for example you want to find out about the various models that are available via this proxy so in case you don't",
  "are available via this proxy so in case you don't understand what a proxy means um so open AI provides the service we are using okay but you don't interact directly with open AI why because you're not giving your credit card details you not giving your uh um you're not paying for the uh usage of it and things of that sort right so you have to purchase tokens from them give your details to them so instead um Anand has purchased I don't know how much but some amount of tokens from open Ai and he",
  "but some amount of tokens from open Ai and he distributes the usage of it uh via what's called a proxy so it stands in place of open AI so it's in between you and open AI so you send a request to one of these endpoints which is on his server and then this server takes your U um AI sorry your um AI proxy token and sends sends the request uh to open AI without you having to have bought anything from them so basically this acts as a middleman so that's what a proxy is so that's what this is okay",
  "what a proxy is so that's what this is okay you can think of it as a midd explain this again because for this week three assignment I'm sorry I joined right now like I have like five problems I solved it but all five my account quot has exceeded it is saying so oh right problem with I mean you have you used it before and it's which one like normal account I have open a I solve problems but actually I'm not able to like fully answer it like okay okay I mean normal open excuse me a normal open a",
  "okay I mean normal open excuse me a normal open a account um normally only is a subscription service right no they give free things actually open AI I did subscribe to it I um I was hoping actually like maybe I can use those model IDs okay no no no that what so I'll explain that so I uh uh so if you in the subscription model for open AI they don't give you access to the API okay okay you can't use the API okay you can only use the web based U yeah yeah it seems subscription you you want to use",
  "yeah it seems subscription you you want to use their API that like I hope actually these guys had used hugging face or something like that then I could have used it but yeah yeah you have to buy uh tokens if you want to actually use their API so that's how it works with open a so that's that's why you're not able to use it so that's let me just get U just give me one second here yeah if you can show me a way how to do that or if you want I can share share you my screen like actually like uh h",
  "share share you my screen like actually like uh h no no that's fine um because I'm going to show how to access uh yeah that's would access it via the proxy okay because that's how your all of your projects are going to have to work okay it will it will have to work via the proxy any and also that ninth um ninth statement ninth question in that uh it is uh saying like um uh we need to access something else actually through IAT thing and then we have to pay some money or I don't know I didn't go",
  "to pay some money or I don't know I didn't go ahead with that actually like if you can no no no there's no no no need to pay money for the ninth one actually like can you click on 9 one uh uh nth one prompt engineering yeah yeah I have found out the prompt actually how to say yes okay but for that to do actually right it is asking for this a proxy when you click on that it is saying actually like maybe you have to use it so many number of times actually like or something like that like I didn't",
  "like or something like that like I didn't use it even once it generated the key but I didn't use it so I'm not sure if we can go ahead with that or M okay anyway we we'll come back to this a bit later yeah and also like I have one more question on because we'll have we'll have at least three two three sessions before uh before this um ga3 is due oh I see I thought actually the day is uh this weekend so yeah yeah it is this weekend but we will have three more sessions at least before then oh I",
  "three more sessions at least before then oh I see okay nice and one uh okay so this is one the other four variations were like actually only on the this one actually what is it quot I exceeded and one more is like the third one actually like that text box doesn't appear so uh there is that uh actually I think there are some extra CSS identifiers actually have to remove then actually and once the text started appearing right actually I generated that uh we don't have to create a key for that but",
  "uh we don't have to create a key for that but I generated the Json for that but I'm not sure if for some reason is taking it or not actually like because I've almost got the same thing text area as as good as for the other other source code it's the same actually like element by element actually the same class CS element and also the same but I don't know for some reason it's not taking it actually so should I have to refresh it or like I just want to check with that that's the third one",
  "just want to check with that that's the third one actually which I had okay yeah we'll um we'll cover it in another um session okay because I at least want to get started with this yeah yeah sure sure sure maybe after like once this is done like I can come in the extra time I can log in back and that would be okay we we'll see okay and one last thing is actually like I actually I joined last week back actually like there was a statement that there will be a deep brief session on the project I I",
  "will be a deep brief session on the project I I I couldn't get any debrief session video is there any debrief which happened yeah so we at the beginning of this session we um we talked about what the requirements for project one is okay okay I'll check that out okay when we upload this video um probably in a few hours time or early tomorrow sure no issues no issues you can watch and you'll be able to get that yeah please continue thank you thank you so much so just give me one second here",
  "thank you so much so just give me one second here [Music] okay so just to I think someone was asking what the what this was so here's the a proxy right this this is your computer here and uh this is okay open Ai and um so in order to use their service either you can subscribe directly okay but this subscription service does not give you access to their API okay which you I think you pay $120 per month for okay so don't think I'll subscribe I'll get access to the API that's not what they give",
  "get access to the API that's not what they give you what they give you is access to their um uh web based model with the $20 subscription instead if you are ever planning to use their U API which is what we are going to use which is very powerful you have to actually buy the tokens okay and uh when you buy these tokens um then you get charged not per month let's say for example you for argument sake you bought $10 worth of tokens uh you can use this in one year if you want or you can use this",
  "this in one year if you want or you can use this in one day if you want right it makes no difference this is like uh basically like pouring petrol okay how quickly you use it is up to you so uh that's the difference and uh it's completely based on your usage so we'll see in a moment I'll just demonstrate to you in a moment how many tokens it takes to send a request so you'll get a sense of how quickly or how slowly you use them up okay so that's if you're doing it directly through open AI okay",
  "if you're doing it directly through open AI okay uh so remember subscription does not give you access to their um uh to their um what do you call it their API okay it only gives you access to their web based service the other nice thing about their uh API service is if you got uh tokens you get access to not just their GPT U model there you know the four for you get access to also uh whisper which is their Audio model you get access to uh di okay di 3 you get all access to all these uh if",
  "okay di 3 you get all access to all these uh if you're buying tokens but uh if you're buying the subscription you don't get access to all these you only get access to their um their web- based U chat completion system okay you cannot for example generate images and things of that sort at least not that I'm aware of at the moment but through the tokens if you're buying tokens you get access to all these things so how many of you have seen the new logo for tools in data science on YouTube I'm",
  "new logo for tools in data science on YouTube I'm hoping at least someone has noticed so I generated that by making an API call to open AI okay and I used di3 for that okay I just uh used the tokens and asked it to create one for tools in data science so it's very very very good that di 3 allows for commercial and non and we are not doing commercial use though yeah so so that's an example of what can be done now the problem is of course you'll have to buy these or you'll have to use a credit",
  "have to buy these or you'll have to use a credit card because I don't think they accept debit card I'm not sure and um and the other thing is it's in US dollars so it's not in Indian rupees you will have to pay a conversion charge um you can use sorry yeah sorry actually I I was giving some information but I don't think it is right so okay yeah so there are some some difficulties okay for people who want to spend dollars from their Indian accounts so um so that's something that you might you",
  "so um so that's something that you might you might have to be aware of so instead of that right we have provided you this middleman okay or rather I should say Anand has provided you this which is he's got a a server of his own he has bought the tokens and um what he has done is he's through this um site I showed you just now uh you're able to then generate your own key okay now the difference is you can't use this key directly with open AI okay because open AI does not recognize this key okay",
  "because open AI does not recognize this key okay it doesn't even know it exists but this key is what you use with his server okay he has generated this key he gives you this key you communicate okay you send your open AI request right constructed in a very specific format with the key and then on your behalf he communicates with open Ai and then it sends a response back to you to actually to the proxy and then the proxy responds to you okay so that's how this uh workflow happens uh so is there",
  "how this uh workflow happens uh so is there any questions at this point if there's no questions no okay then I'll uh get back to where we were sh [Music] screen okay okay so now that you know you need the key and you know how to to get the key the next thing is you need to um use these uh end points that he has created okay you can't use the one that open AI gives you because as I've just explained you have to use his proxy instead so here's one end point yeah in order to um use uh the proxy",
  "end point yeah in order to um use uh the proxy this is works the same as chat completions so that's why it's that's what it's called and this is the only model that is actually available to you um so that's the GPT 40 mini okay so we'll put that in here okay so that's the URL uh the next thing you need is you need some headers so any request that you send on the internet uh requires of course the URL but it also requires some headers uh to work uh now when you type a you in your browser window",
  "uh now when you type a you in your browser window the URL you don't see this headers part but your browser is actually sending some head of its own okay it's sending information to the server like where it's from what is the browser that is being used all sorts of little bits of information are going from your computer apart from the URL but that is automatically filled by the browser but because we are using u a program to uh access this endpoint we are now using the headers we we have to",
  "we are now using the headers we we have to provide the headers as well otherwi it won't work okay because this is the way how normally the um um Communications across the internet work and how tcpip and all these things which we will not talk about now um is involved in this process so one of the headers that you have to give is called authorization okay and if you look at the documentation it shows you here as well you can see it over here authorization right so uh this will be in the form of",
  "right so uh this will be in the form of a dictionary key value pair so authorization and uh then you have to uh put your token over here so I'm using an F string okay because I I've already U put the token in a variable so beer put the API key and um yeah that should be it so we got the URL we got the headers uh next thing is um I'll uh for now I'll just type this over here and leave it as is uh the third thing we need in order to access the API is uh what we're going to send it send to the",
  "API is uh what we're going to send it send to the endpoint okay and um this endpoint at its very basic level first of all requires the model okay so what model you're using there are many models on the server we yor key has only access to the GPT 40 model sorry sorry GPT 40 mini actually mini okay so that's one thing you need to put in there the next thing is you need to send it some messages so this is the messages that you'll be sending uh messages uh as the name implies is an array so there",
  "uh as the name implies is an array so there are several things that could be sent several messages that could be sent um for our purposes um for a basic um communication with the l we will first of all give it a role okay and this if you're wondering why uh it's a requirement of how this proxy is set up okay so role and content is required so the role I've given is what the system role is which is in other words the open ai's role and so we'll say Your Role is to uh let's say identify um the",
  "say Your Role is to uh let's say identify um the sentiment of um so this is what is called a system prompt yeah yeah this is a system prompt you're you're effectively saying that this is the role it should uh do okay say just say positive negative I mean this could be anything okay I'm just using a very simplistic example okay um something else I was going to mention but I'll demonstrate it a little little bit later for now I'll leave it as is uh then the next role is okay what role we are",
  "is uh then the next role is okay what role we are playing in this which is the user role we are going to provide it the content okay we have given the role to the system but now we need to provide it some content right this is where I'll use our variable okay so here we will put some sentence um any of you want to volunteer a sentence for me please help in solving the TDS project patience is please solve in help me please help in solving sorry please solv in the DDS project okay right so that's",
  "solv in the DDS project okay right so that's our content uh am I missing missing a comma oops okay that's fine so so that's the payload that's ready now the next thing uh we need now to do is uh we need to send the request so we use request library and um something that's always useful although we don't need it it uh for this request I'll just put it here anyway uh we need to use Json quite often um because most of our Communications is via Json in fact I should say all our communication is via",
  "in fact I should say all our communication is via Json so requests uh Dot and this is a post request so if you look at the um if you look at the documentation here this is a post request there's another kind of post request you can use that's for embeddings we we'll get into that a bit later and there are get requests so this one is a this chat completion is a post request so request. poost and then um you need a URL which we have you need the headers which we have and uh we need Json uh",
  "the headers which we have and uh we need Json uh payload so these are required keywords okay in this request and um right so if I run this now it will start sending a request to the open a that's why it took 5.7 seconds to execute right so the first thing I want to tell you which is very important don't write your request code in a big block of code that you need to debug because each time you need to debug it will keep hitting the request okay and uh can anyone tell me what happens when you",
  "and uh can anyone tell me what happens when you keep on doing this over and over again when you're debugging a lot of time consumption will happen which is not referred in this project yeah so one is time consumption but the bigger can anyone tell me what the bigger problem is qua running out correct your quota runs out for because you're debugging something that's not related with the request itself right so keep this always in a separate block now eventually when you have your application",
  "now eventually when you have your application running it won't be in a notebook like this okay I accept that but when you're constructing the application don't construct it in one big py file to begin with construct it piece by piece in a notebook so that you can debug various sections of it and then once you are satisfied hey you know this code works well now then you can combine it all together into a py file and then run your application uh with in a single block of four but until then don't",
  "in a single block of four but until then don't do that okay so now let's uh have a look at the status code see if our request was successful so it says it was successful that's good that's good news so now let's see what what we got back as a response so response. Json so here is the first look at what went in okay so we can see that it used the 40 model and uh there are some various things here and uh what we interested is what the message that came back okay and this is what we this is the",
  "came back okay and this is what we this is the actual response it says negative uh sentiment for this sentence um please help us in solving the TDS project okay so for some reason it thought that was a negative sentiment okay then there are some other useful things here you can see this usage over here this tells how many Tokens The Prompt took okay The Prompt took 32 tokens this prompt that we gave over here this took 3 sorry this this took uh actually not sure if it's this or this together",
  "actually not sure if it's this or this together yeah I think it is yeah so these two together I think took 32 tokens okay completion tokens is the response so the word negative now this is this should interest you it's one word but actually took two tokens to make this uh response and so total token was 34 and then what is very useful for you so this prompt that we sent right cost us uh so this is in dollars one 10,000th of a dollar is what this Pro this uh particular call cost us okay I've",
  "Pro this uh particular call cost us okay I've done so far seven requests on this particular key that I have and you can see the total usage of my cost so far this uh in these seven requests but um that's what you get back as a response so important things to remember try and um keep track of these two variables okay whenever you're sending a call track them record them maybe in a file somewhere so that you get a sense of this is another thing that we have done in the past whenever we are making",
  "we have done in the past whenever we are making a large piece of code that uses the llm two things we record in a file okay you all know how to use file output in python right so I'm not going to show that at the moment you just basically open a file a text file in the text file store three things the three things you want to store are what was your prompt and how many tokens sorry not how many Tok and how much it cost you and if you want you can put the monthly cost but if you put these two",
  "can put the monthly cost but if you put these two things how much it cost you and what the prompt was this will help you a lot later okay it may seem silly at the moment but when you're working on the project and you're doing a lot of things you want to be as efficient as possible so if you suddenly send a prompt and the output you got was huge right but it was valuable and it works and it does great and you want that uh then at least you have a record of the fact that hey this is the prompt I",
  "record of the fact that hey this is the prompt I used first of all that's important because sometimes we forget what prompt we use to get that exact output so recording the prompts are useful and then you can Al also so know okay this much how much it cost so if it cost a lot of money I'm not going to run this prompt again but at least for future reference if I want to again put it back in my program uh at the end then I can put it back but uh record the prompts that you doing the useful",
  "uh record the prompts that you doing the useful prompts of course you can of course record the nonuseful prompts as well but you keep the ones that are useful store it in a file okay so that's some good tip for you guys okay so this is how a basic API call is made any questions so far it should be very easy from can share this uh uh notebook file please uh so okay some one more thing uh we don't typically share the notebook file itself Okay Okay the reason being um then you will not really get",
  "the reason being um then you will not really get to grips with it um so that's why we don't share the notebook file but there is a notebook file available it is um so if you go this one if you go here this file is available for you to look at okay any anything which has a sample usage that's all so this is similar to what we did um this does some other things so this looks at the models for example so that's why it's uh hitting the the model section and then over here um what they've done is um",
  "and then over here um what they've done is um they have looked at reviews of a movie in Panda's data frame and uh then they're trying to get the sentiment of the the movies okay using llms and again you can see a similar thing has been done but this is sometimes difficult to understand when there's lots going on so that's why I showed you the very basic of how to construct it okay the next thing I want to show you is parsing this is easy okay so another thing you really want ought to do is when",
  "another thing you really want ought to do is when you're passing the response this is a quick and easy way to pass the response so you go response. Json and then as you can see it's a dictionary key pair so what we want for example is the choices so then we do choices and then in choices okay before I do that let's just do this so you can see okay this is choices now you can see that choices is an array so we can say zero now you can see uh we want message so then you can do message okay and",
  "want message so then you can do message okay and then in message you can see you want content okay so now you can do content content and ultimately you get the actual response you want right uh so why is this useful in your project this is effectively what will be happening uh later on when we show you function calling uh you will be you know someone will send your llm or rather your code a prompt okay a task to run and it will come in this form of sentence like this and then your llm will have",
  "of sentence like this and then your llm will have to decide which function to call okay but a function call has a specific name right when you if you remember making functions in Python you'll have Define some function okay and it'll do something right um okay your function call will do something uh and so when you want the llm to run a specific function it should know exactly what function to call right so that's why you need to get back the exact response not this whole bunch of stuff here so",
  "response not this whole bunch of stuff here so remember that parsing parsing it in this format will help you achieve that okay um so that's something to keep in mind you can use even JQ also H you can use whatever your whatever you are comfortable with there's no no restrictions we don't care how your internals work if you're happy with JavaScript use JavaScript if you're comfortable with python use Python JQ is a command line you can just use a command line JQ okay I'm not uh not familiar with",
  "command line JQ okay I'm not uh not familiar with JQ so yeah you don't have to write even a script line also like just okay query L yeah sure uh but remember at the end of the day date should run in your application right the output whatever you want for project should work there um next thing is uh right so that was about how to send a simple prompt um uh this is okay so the next aspect I want to talk to you about is uh Pro there is various types of training that you can do to your llm okay so",
  "of training that you can do to your llm okay so when you want to train it to do something you can do either what's called onot training or you can do uh multi-shot training or you can do zero short training so there are various sorts of things okay so zero short training means no training you just do it okay like and that's what we did over here there was no training involved it just did it but in one short training we give it an example and here you can say see um uh an example of giving it",
  "you can say see um uh an example of giving it the llm some idea of what you expect so there was a review and uh if you look at here there are four messages here I don't know this is very visible okay there are four messages here and um uh they we wanted to break down the reviews into uh the acting the storyline and the direction and then the other thing that uh we wanted to do is uh we wanted to get a sense of what this review was for us okay so we said okay after watching you'll be hooked etc",
  "we said okay after watching you'll be hooked etc etc I mean it's got all this information in here all that review has been put there and this is where we put our uh our analysis of it okay we say yeah acting we say is good storyline we say is good direction is good so this is something we give to the llm so the llm understands that this kind of review this is how we rate it okay so based on this we have now trained the llm to understand that these kind of reviews should get this kind of um",
  "these kind of reviews should get this kind of um feedback you know like that is story line is good direction is good that sort of thing so this has been trained now on a sample of one and then we ask it okay now you go ahead and do the same thing now we you give it another review and uh then it uh gives you its response based on the example you have given it okay so this is kind of like prompt engineering but it's done in an API style so that's what uh aspect based sentiment is or or in",
  "that's what uh aspect based sentiment is or or in particular this is uh what TR what how you train llms to do certain things or behave a certain way instead of it choosing how to behave by itself uh so that's another as aspect okay um now so far these have been very sort of what you call ndy examples okay not very particularly useful but still has some value this next example that is shown here which is extraction this is where llms really come into its uh into its own uh in terms of its",
  "come into its uh into its own uh in terms of its abilities okay uh normally when you're calling functions in a program you want structured output to come from a unstructured input uh so for example uh I know this particular one is not a very good example but here is an a way of structuring your output from anlm so here a prompt was given and uh this is the question that was asked but we want the response back and this is the key part okay so first we had models and messages everything is the",
  "we had models and messages everything is the same but this is the extra bit so I'll just put it in the U yes code here so you can just see it properly okay so if you look on here this extra bit okay that's what uh comes in here so you got you you got the payload as models and messages but it'll also have this response format okay and inside response format these are non-negotiables okay this tells you want it uh back in Json so it won't come in the form of a long piece of text it'll come",
  "in the form of a long piece of text it'll come exactly out as a Json then you describe the Json schema itself okay uh and then in the Json schema I don't know this is better or that is better maybe this is better okay so in the Json schema itself you give tell give it a name uh this is again required uh so when you say strict true it should not deviate from this scheme that you have given it in other words it should not suddenly create its own um um key value pairs okay and not hallucinate a",
  "um um key value pairs okay and not hallucinate a different structure so that's why this is very important okay so you give you say strict equal to true and then you describe the schema that it's supposed to respond back to you in so again it's got to be of a type object uh these are the properties of this object and these are the so the properties is it has something called steps steps is a type of array uh the array has some items each of these items is an object and each of these objects have",
  "items is an object and each of these objects have these properties okay this is basic Json construction schema okay and uh if I'm going a bit fast and if you didn't understand just you can say is to slow down okay but I'm assuming you're understanding that's why there's uh no no sound from you guys okay so the type array has items items have uh objects these objects have this property the property is are there's a key called explanation and there's a key called output the explanation uh key uh",
  "a key called output the explanation uh key uh is of type string and the output is of type string okay and they are both required so that's why we put this uh key over here saying they are both required and then additional properties false this is also a required key okay don't miss this out you will get errors if you don't have this and then uh if you look back at the schema uh which which had steps okay one of the things it had was steps but it also has a final answer okay so there's steps and",
  "also has a final answer okay so there's steps and there's final answer we want this this uh API call to this question to gives give us the steps and to give us the final answer and so the final answer is also of a type string and the steps are of a type array and the array have explanation and an output and they both required and then when we go to the outer part here also you will see we want both the steps and the final answer and then again we add additional properties equal to fals and this",
  "add additional properties equal to fals and this completes the response format of the scheme oh actually it's explained over here as sorry I didn't notice but if you go through this right it may take some time for you to get to grips with but understand how this structure works okay uh because this is a very basic construction why I'm saying this is important is in your project this will be required when you start doing function calls we have not talked about function calling it will take I",
  "not talked about function calling it will take I think function calling will most likely take at least an hour uh to demonstrate and discuss with you so next session we will certainly talk about function calling we will not be able to do it tonight but at least understand how the schema works and this helps you then get back a structured output in the form of a Json schema uh for the uh application that you using Okay um base 64 encoding I'll not talk about it today again Vision models is",
  "not talk about it today again Vision models is exactly the same as the previous one there's a role there's a Content uh there is um there are some extra details that you require to do in case you're parsing images uh the other thing to remember is um although here they have sent a URL you can actually send a proper image to uh the API but you would have to send it in the form of a base 64 encoded uh URI it's called okay uh I'll explain that next time how you do that uh basically what it does is",
  "time how you do that uh basically what it does is it takes your image and it converts it into um a a string of characters so even though your image is made up of pixels and dots and colors and all sorts of things it splits it up into uh six bit um values and then it produces a chunk of 24 bits and then those 24 bits it encodes it into uh another form uh which uh basically are represented by uh asy characters and and those aski characters are A to Z so your entire image which were in the form of",
  "Z so your entire image which were in the form of pixels and colors and all sorts of things get represented as a to z then 0 to 9 and plus and hash and sorry plus and dash forward slash um so U that's how you convert it and once it's converted then you can uh send it to your API because uh how else can you upload the image right you have to send it in some form uh some representation of your image image so base 64 encoding is how we send it to the API and then once you send an image you can do",
  "API and then once you send an image you can do all sorts of very cool processing the same things you have seen with GPT right you send an image of say um and so um one great example is I've seen students do this and I've done it myself uh you know when you get your end term uh not end term sorry your quiz one answer key is there right and they've given you some options and instead of waiting for the session to get your answer as to why this is the correct answer just upload the the the",
  "is the correct answer just upload the the the screenshot of that uh question from your quiz and ask the llm and it will then look at that and give you tell you what is the right answer and why it is the right answer so how do you do that with an API you send it a base 64 encoded uh URI okay uh but we will not I'll not talk about how to do that today I'll show it to you um next session or the session afterwards okay embeddings is another important topic in llms um this has to do with what I was",
  "topic in llms um this has to do with what I was speaking about earlier the fact that tokens are represented by matrices sorry tokens are represented by vectors and uh how this can be valuable to us U is something that is very important for us to cover uh tokens themselves are costly if you are able to use embeddings directly you will reduce the cost by an order of 10 so you know instead of spending $100 on some sort of processing you'll be able to do it for $10 for example or you may be able to",
  "do it for $10 for example or you may be able to do it for $1 and that's by leveraging the fact that uh these embeddings are freely available to us you can download these embeddings from hugging face for um almost any model that is out there you just need a machine that's able to par these vectors and um so we will demonstrate that in in in a future session okay so embeddings has to do with the fact that tokens are represented by vectors and how we use them we will show in the next class topic",
  "we use them we will show in the next class topic modeling Vector databases retrieval augmented yeah so there's quite a lot but this will be the most important thing function calling and uh that's why I don't want to start on it today because we are uh the session is almost over but if you get time things to go over uh text extraction uh go over the uh initial setup try some few API calls uh you can even try some Vision models and Bas 64 encoding because it is in one of your gas and uh at least",
  "because it is in one of your gas and uh at least uh try and watch this video on function calling uh we'll also do a working example of function calling uh in fact we we will use uh last terms project two to show you an example of function calling and um then when we actually do the prototype for this terms project we will be using function calling extensively function calling uh just to give you a quick overview so uh remember I to showed you messages and these sorts of uh things that uh we",
  "messages and these sorts of uh things that uh we send to the API so also there are tools that you send okay you send it a set of tools and these tools are nothing but functions and these functions have a name just like a normal function does so you can see here this has got get balance this has got calculate burus performance bonus these are various functions and the API has to call these functions based on your prompt that you get okay and so that's what function calling is about how to",
  "so that's what function calling is about how to construct these and how your API actually interacts with with the user and then calls the right functions which then does something valuable for you in your project is what uh is what we'll be discussing next time but uh if you get a chance at least watch the video of function calling so you get a sense of how it works and then we will do a a working example of it time so anything uh any questions you guys have at the moment yes hey uh so what I",
  "you guys have at the moment yes hey uh so what I was telling is for example there are few topics mentioned over there prompt engineering TDS ta instructions llm sentiment analysis if we will simply go through like while while we are doing self study will I will I be able to get some of the idea which like what we are trying to refer yes yes you will get I mean this this content is very good okay I mean as far far as these are concerned these are just showing you how we are using it in our in",
  "just showing you how we are using it in our in our own workflows this is really really good content like this is very simplified this is because reading through documentation is very difficult so that's why we've taken all this effort to put this together for you so it's uh well worth it okay but don't worry we will also demonstrate we will also teach it and do some working examples as well so you can get grips with yes an Manas uh Caron while explaining the first question in the llm part we",
  "explaining the first question in the llm part we saw that you use some parts of the token so does all the questions uh in this thing will take some costing to solve like from the tokens so in the G itself you will hardly use it I think most of the questions can be solved without uh using the token but but there are a couple of questions where you would need it um but for the project yeah definitely you will end up using tokens but I uh I would encourage you to practice uh see today is 28th okay",
  "you to practice uh see today is 28th okay if I were you in your place right I know it's going to be renewed on February 1st right make maximum use of this time 28 29 30 31st these four days use up the whole $1 okay or at least most of it because it'll be renewed at the beginning of February anyway because it doesn't they don't accumulate okay $1 doesn't become two so use that to experiment and at least get a sense of how it works and that'll be very helpful for you so that's why over the next",
  "very helpful for you so that's why over the next so tomorrow day after and probably on Friday and maybe Saturday we'll have some extra sessions and we will uh we'll extensively deal with this llms because it's very important for you to get an A good grasp of how to use it and how to make it work in your workflows so this is the really the heart of the old TDS I would say uh using smart agents and uh using it in your workflow may I ask the question which I mentioned earlier okay well J are you",
  "which I mentioned earlier okay well J are you there okay yeah can you take queries from I think it was ask okay sir may I share my screen sure enough okay sir [Music] s is screen visible yeah uh sir see I am having this issue actually here it's running and my code is also running uh I have just stopped it uh so look at this but when I paste it here it says this you don't have to pass theam just uh sir sorry I can't hear you hello am I AUD uh your voice is not really clear so I think what he was",
  "voice is not really clear so I think what he was trying to say is don't pass the parameters only pass the API just remove from that question mark use the remove in the answer in the answer remove from that question mark yeah just remove that that's it now try talk oh my God the thing is actually you see in the right you see there the bottom it's using course to send it there like the bottom terminal you see that if you have po you can just use that okay and then that's how you can do it okay so",
  "okay and then that's how you can do it okay so you can even it locally most of the apps using core only here course so yeah good okay sir thank you so much I have one question is that okay to to ask now actually like I just am new to this like um like I've submitted these answers but I don't not know like for this thing it has a different way um can I ask it quickly like if I sure sure can I sorry yeah just I want to uh um you see for for this one I don't get any here like I just want to know",
  "one I don't get any here like I just want to know if I've done it correct or not like uh um so here we submit this that is all actually like should we do anything else like I mean uh usually that's all actually like I've been doing like uh how how do you do that actually like like here there's nothing to submit here like you just say yes yeah so you just say yes here and then you need to submit to the URL that is there so this will only pick up yeah it will pick up but uh why is it not",
  "pick up yeah it will pick up but uh why is it not reflecting uh I think they haven't P okay okay then that's fine okay okay that's fine okay yeah that is all actually like the remaining anyways the doubts will be cleared in the next session yeah thank you J I have a question if you can answer sure it's about the sessions is uh the week two part of the course completely covered in the sessions oh if week two part is completely covered in the session yes like in week one we went through all the",
  "yes like in week one we went through all the different parts like that is the week two completely covered out actually yes it is completely covered out but the way we have covered is a bit different in these two we have gone through the important things that were required so for example we exactly haven't discussed the questions but those things actually require we need to discuss we had we discuss most of so referring to the Past sessions will give me the concise idea of the important parts of",
  "me the concise idea of the important parts of the ga G2 week two week two J your voice is like completely muffled out it's not coming clearly only it someone else low okay so what I was saying uh is it okay now am I AUD yes you're okay so what I was saying we have covered GitHub ACS and then we have also covered do images how do you that and then I let me what is I and what we have covered so um yeah we have also covered the deployment part of it how we can Ro and how you can deploy it onel as",
  "how we can Ro and how you can deploy it onel as well and we have covered this fast these are the four important parts sir your voice is very much low it is not clear uh [Music] I sorry for inter interupting I got the concise idea of what you're trying to say so if it's all right I like you have cleared my doubt essentially thank you sir I have a doubt in ga uh 1 that is question 10 and 11 I've also posted that doubt on discourse but haven't got any reply on that okay what is your sir in",
  "got any reply on that okay what is your sir in question 10 uh we have uh that uh hash button which we have to Ed to uh convert the Json file I've converted the Json file in the given format but the hash button is showing error again and again which I could not recognize I've posted that question actually I've joined from Tab and I'm not at my home so that's why I I couldn't join right now with the laptop and show you that but I have posted that error on discourse form uh and in question 11 sir",
  "error on discourse form uh and in question 11 sir uh the statement which is uh telling me that below element in which C SS uh the whole code is has to be run uh I didn't get what the question is saying uh that's why I couldn't solve that question I didn't get the question I've confused in the question yes sir this actually someone had replied to it that you have to first convert it to is e should be and then this Ms a c 5 5K it should be Val what it is saying you have to create object kind of",
  "it is saying you have to create object kind of dictionary only and then you must have over here and then value should be this whatever it is okay sir so we have to use inverted uh double quotes yeah for key and for the value as well okay sir okay so now I get it sir that's why I'm getting the error and sir in question 11 uh that is okay yeah this is the one yes sir in in this the it is uh telling me what's the uh uh that is class in the hidden element below the what does this line mean that I'm",
  "below the what does this line mean that I'm not getting I I've done this should be element which at which position do you did you right click the and uh go to the inspect that is I just do right click and then yes inspect but sir I didn't get any class named as F which is in the question given so uh this one uh this is hiden element with data value and so this is the one you had to select and then with this so these are the classes yes sir so data values yes sir 30 and okay sir now I get it sir",
  "values yes sir 30 and okay sir now I get it sir thank you sir thank you sir thank you so much any friend",

  "are you adash Kumar are you a student on TDS yes sir yourm ID nor we don't let uh anyone join these sessions who don't use theirm ID so can you rejoin the session with your itm ID uh sure sir thank you so today's session will be mostly about doubt clearing uh so if anyone have any doubt in ga2 or ga3 then we can take those dos sir I honestly haven't seen the GS uh right now so I'll probably uh maybe maybe come tomorrow after I've solved it so rwi one of the things is um tomorrow and day after",
  "one of the things is um tomorrow and day after we'll mostly be covering content so we will be delivering content there will be not that much scope for doubt clearing tomorrow okay um but that doesn't mean we won't clear doubts but it'll be towards the end of the session or while we are discussing a certain topic then if the doubt is regarding that very specific top topic then uh will uh will those sessions cover content relevant to G2 uh not G2 it'll be relevant to ga3 okay okay okay because um",
  "be relevant to ga3 okay okay okay because um ga3 by the way the deadline I don't know if you've received the mail or not but ga3 deadline has been pushed to Wednesday really grateful for that yeah we we had a meeting this morning to discuss that so um based on the feedback we decided um that uh move ga3 for half a week but uh there will be no other changes okay this is the last change ga4 will still be due um the following Sunday okay okay G2 content looks very straightforward so I I'll attempt",
  "looks very straightforward so I I'll attempt that in case I have any doubt after the sessions are ending I I'll ask them yeah later that would be uh hi Anand morti yeah so uh like uh I was a bit confused about the image compression thing in [Music] and as go ahead and share your screen no no like uh I was not able to start on it only like I was trying to copy those codes and try to run it in the collab but it was asking for third party uh uh authentication yeah yeah yeah so then I like like",
  "authentication yeah yeah yeah so then I like like since I didn't I wasn't very much sure what it was asking and I pulled back from there okay so I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question I have just used the website that was given because I I have tried using uh code but it says because of some reason it was giving me error that Dimension is not matching with the actual Dimension I mean the original FES Dimension that's why I use the web application that is",
  "that's why I use the web application that is there okay so so uh any specific use case of this one like like I like it's like uh any example where it has been used like should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters which are there like for example path will be related to some uh [Music] website website URL uh so you are talking about Comm python okay im images comparation uh from path path Li library to import path and from P to import image import IO and from there",
  "from P to import image import IO and from there onwards do we just need to use this code and change it with the uh related parameters uh yeah so this should be the input path and then this should be where you want to save it and then these are different things that you can change but actually I have tried this code and it was giving me the error that input Dimension is not matching with the output Dimension that's why I use this particular website which is the but yes okay so so so resizing",
  "which is the but yes okay so so so resizing kind of like rather than using this one we can just uh uh like uh this converter this is a converter app sco sc. app yeah okay where it will be used it will be used in the future classes um image compression no I don't think we will spend much time on it but so basically it is important from Feb perspective for example most of the information on web pages so in this particular video I think they have talked about it I think 50 or 51% of the",
  "have talked about it I think 50 or 51% of the information is in video in image format so how we can reduce the size of image that's what is there okay okay okay also also one thing uh sorry I was I just cut you in between yeah go ahead please yeah but but from pro project perspective or in future weeks it won't be that relevant okay second thing is uh sorry like it's related to uh I I tried to do get commit from my CLI so but based on but based on what do you call based on the given uh ID they",
  "on what do you call based on the given uh ID they have created a uh a new repository is like I I want to use the one which I have created for uh like which I was using it for ga1 so how can I make so so how can I make sure that the whatever changes I'm making it will get committed to the repository which I have signed up just share your screen an it'll be EAS actually I also didn't understand your question [Music] okay system settings can directly your screen and audio okay meanwhile if uh",
  "your screen and audio okay meanwhile if uh anyone else has any doubts CU Anand I think will rejoin the session shortly yes sir I have a issue with one answer yes so sorry hang on Arin I think sakshi raised her hand so uh sakshi yeah go ahead please sir I have a doubt in uh question 4 uh uh actually uh I've done the uh versal file that question uh the versal uh question that is question number six that is saying what is the versal URL I'm uploading that URL but it is not uh showing that it is a",
  "that URL but it is not uh showing that it is a just can I share my screen sure sure sure yes sir sir my screen is visible right now no just sir is it visible now yes now it is Sir in this question uh the question number six it is saying that download this file and which has marks 100 student I've have done the uh uh I have uh create repository that is students marks API in The Bash uh terminal and then I also uh make an API uh folder in it and I add a file index. ppy which is doing this okay uh",
  "add a file index. ppy which is doing this okay uh can you go to verel dashboard and uh yeah just also close your that meet. Google that is the picture in picture just close that sir it is the code that I'm uh going through but uh and I also did the requirement. text that is include flask and flask course mhm uh but in the yes sir uh just a minute yes sir it is the versal web page just go to the project that you are using for this particular website uh for that particular question sir I didn't",
  "uh for that particular question sir I didn't create any project in uh on the versal page actually I've created uh using the bash commands yeah okay uh can you go to question two I mean sorry G2 page yes yes sir so what is name of the project student hyph okay can you go to versel yes sir okay can you get go to the first one STD hyphen Mark yeah okay is it this one yes sir it is showing uh first it is showing not found uh uh again I was uh try uh I'm trying it so again it is showing like uh it",
  "I'm trying it so again it is showing like uh it just uh when I open the file from the terminal it gets downloaded from the uh web page when the web page opens nothing was uh on the web page okay and there is nothing on the downloaded file as well so I'm bit confused what is uh can you click on view code button just to make sure that it is the same code because I'm not sure about the project yeah this button and it have question ver okay yeah this is the same code can you go to deployment uh sir",
  "is the same code can you go to deployment uh sir from yes sir yeah here and click on one of the links that is for domain that s above one above one okay can you append back/ API to the URL no no to the same URL yes yes can you print back API okay uh now can you go to versal dashboard again yes sir uh can you go to logs uh it is near functions yes yeah so here can you open this message that is there and what does this message show just open that red color part Zoom it a bit no no the below one",
  "red color part Zoom it a bit no no the below one it's not readable yes sir that's why can can you copy copy there's a copy function there on the just copy it and put it into a notebook or okay sir just a minute sir sir can I copy in GPT uh uh yeah you can as well yeah it's visible kind of you can also just put it in notepad that also will work just so that we can see what it is oh oh that is because this particular flask module is not installed on the veral okay sir so sir but I uh take that in",
  "the veral okay sir so sir but I uh take that in requirement do text file that is flask and flask course and I pushed that capital f then in sorry sir instead of a small F in flask put capital capital F now is it okay sir but is it is showing okay I think you have used GitHub right yes sir okay uh Calton you have tried with GitHub but does it require any kind of other commands that you need to run for example to install the dependencies I haven't tried with GitHub typically with GitHub you don't",
  "tried with GitHub typically with GitHub you don't need um I when I tried it uh I didn't need a requirements file I just pushed the code and it works directly from GitHub let me let me just [Music] are sir one more thing in fast API question I have also a doubt I'm pushing the website but it is not uh I don't know it is not taking the conditions that have mentioned in the question that is API class equals to 1 a or class equals to 1 B then it is also uh it's also giving whole uh Json file whole",
  "also uh it's also giving whole uh Json file whole details of okay uh regarding the versel question yes sir actually you can mention capital F there but I think it won't install because code I mean yeah so um just so I've just checked uh checked it just now so on the GitHub page uh I don't have a requirements file if you pushed it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub then uh it uh you don't need the requirements file so something else is the issue which is I think it's not able to pull the",
  "issue which is I think it's not able to pull the flask module because that's what it says right the error so so should I uh install it uh separately from while running the file sir um I mean I just used um the HTTP do server and um there is um an example code given in ga2 itself for question six right let me just see here yeah so there's a sample code there that uses HTTP server right uh if you look uh over there and um yeah just go a little bit down yeah that that piece of code so I just",
  "bit down yeah that that piece of code so I just modified just this bit and put my function in there and it works without any issues so uh okay sir I'll try I'll try it sir for this cuz that's the only only difference I just modified that and I put the function inside that uh uh piece of code uh that handles the request and so sir uh I don't have to uh a separate file that is uh requirement. txg no you won't require uh requirements for it versal is able to run the program without that but you",
  "is able to run the program without that but you would still need to verify that your function actually runs so that's uh that's one thing you'll have to check and see okay sir okay sir I'll do it sir one more thing in question number nine wait a second yeah okay sir I think maybe it is because HTTP was pre-installed with python it's possible yeah HTTP server is probably an inbuilt python function most likely Library rather yeah has anyone else had luck with the using flask for this uh",
  "else had luck with the using flask for this uh particular question I did but that one is in my company like laptop not in my personal laptop right okay okay yeah I didn't use flas I just followed uh whatever was provided the template that was provided in the question and that works flawlessly without any problems okay sir sir I'll try uh to do it with the given example file okay sir uh one more question in question number nine in fast API I'm uh I'm giving the uh URL but it is uh it is when I",
  "I'm giving the uh URL but it is uh it is when I run the file that it will show the whole data and and when I'm comp when I'm additionally uh putting the conditions it also shows the whole data so that's the uh I'll show you the can you put slash API at the end of that yes yes just a second sir should I run this first sir um yeah but before we do that let's just uh see what error comes out on the cuz you haven't put the actual correct URL right just SL AP sir actually I closed the uh okay oh you",
  "SL AP sir actually I closed the uh okay oh you Clos the right right okay okay yeah run run these run the yes sir okay and um if you give it a parameter use one of those so you can use yes sir uh just uh it is also giving me the that's yeah so that's some logic error in your code actually CU it should not fetch all of it there is some some logic yes sir I'm uh I'm checking the fs condition but I didn't get this is the code or there is the F's condition uh it is patching the data but it is always",
  "uh it is patching the data but it is always going in this condition uh what is the um uh so your query actually says class right as in CLA SS without the underscore so but that's not what it's expecting uh you know if you put underscore there it will probably give you the correct response just try with underscore okay sir just just a second sir there's a fix for this um okay so now it's working sir yeah so that's most likely the issue but the problem is uh or rather the trick in the question is",
  "is uh or rather the trick in the question is the fact that you still have to use the keyword class clas without the underscore your current piece of code uh okay sir so I will I will edit the code sir yes yeah you'll have to fix the code but just make sure that when you're changing class underscore uh the word class itself is a key word in Python okay so you're going to have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called CLS not C sscore okay sir okay sir so just be mindful of that",
  "okay sir okay sir so just be mindful of that so then if you fix that it will work okay sir so for versal I will uh uh take the example code and I will try to run it yeah okay sir thank you sir so next is uh Arna go ahead please I know we hello yeah good hi good evening sir good evening uh sir I have a doubt in question number 10 of G2 uh let me share my screen please uh you can just close the picture in picture it won't U disconnect the session for would you please check out the session s then",
  "for would you please check out the session s then I can find later uh AR know you would have to use the enro URL the one that is in front of forwarding in the terminal I think you are on mute oh sorry hello yeah so you would have to use this particular Ur https F d8c can you try this URL okay sir in this also I was getting error that's why I can you first open it to a browser in new tab is it uh click on visit site okay uh go to the yes yes question tab it's it's not working okay can you scroll",
  "tab it's it's not working okay can you scroll a bit down [Music] it looks like a cloud flare error isn't it I mean uh I have noted this error yeah it is from cloud flare yeah you could just try again when did you try this I mean apart from just now sir yesterday itself okay and you got the same error yesterday as well is it yeah yeah sir same error okay um you have any suggestions jaaj or we can notify Anand about it no for this particular issue I don't have any suggestions yeah uh so what you",
  "I don't have any suggestions yeah uh so what you do is in this course right uh arav you just go go ahead and copy this um error and put it in discourse and tag Anand with this um error and take a small screenshot also of it but uh copy this error response and tag Anand with this okay and uh then we will also okay sir one more thing I wanted to say uh actually I am not means while installing NG with this terminal I was not able to do that so I installed it in different uh directory Itself by the",
  "it in different uh directory Itself by the app so is it doing when I run it I from here it shouldn't matter because uh we are able to access it you know when we did it through the browser it um it still used uh it was still able to access it I mean you can see a 200 okay on there um that uh that means the site is running okay your model is running okay why you're getting a cloud Fair error I'm not entirely sure so that's normally to do with the CDN service that is U giving some sort of response",
  "service that is U giving some sort of response out there so we'll have to check with Anand what the issue is there okay sir and in sir is it is my screen visible still yes sir in this versal question what happened sometimes means it was showing correct earlier and now it's showing error and look it's showing correct again I don't know why this happens yeah and score also yeah so there was yeah so at the moment it's working right yes sir okay so there was a slight bug we actually discussed it",
  "there was a slight bug we actually discussed it this morning with d there was a slight bug in the uh the uh the random generator for the file that you use so that's been I believe it's been fixed now so that's why you're not getting an error at the moment but if you come across this problem again just uh again notify on discour but um it shouldn't um it shouldn't give you a problem anymore this uh that particular one okay okay so that's all now I'm getting error from this I don't know how okay",
  "I'm getting error from this I don't know how okay I see yeah sir in ninth question I'm getting how means earlier it was working fine okay you need to this is the versal one right no sir no this is this one yeah yeah yeah yesterday you have to run the server you'll have to run the server for that okay sir okay sir and for this question I have to post this on discourse yeah that one you post on discourse with the just copy that whole error now itself okay sir and um and put it in a notepad or",
  "itself okay sir and um and put it in a notepad or something and then post on this course okay sir sure sir if you can also um J do you think there's any mileage in getting the Javascript file as well or no need right just go back to that uh notepad where you pasted it okay just give me a second here uh what happened you request a page on a website that is on cloud play Network heading rendering the page what can I do here on the website to Cloud flare yeah this is yeah this is definitely on um",
  "flare yeah this is yeah this is definitely on um on his on his server side there is some some issue going on there okay so yeah definitely copy this and send it on discourse and tag on okay sir sure sir okay but the other ones are solvable you just have to actually I have solved the rest of one uh yeah this on for this I need to start the server and rest are solved yes okay great okay thank you so much yeah no worries okay Hara you can ask your question no hi um thank you um yeah so for uh okay",
  "no hi um thank you um yeah so for uh okay um this is uh regarding week three um like uh for the third question um not sure like actually like I've enabled it so I've got the box but uh this is a valid Json but it says still unexpected end of Json input can you copy this Json to vs code yeah okay save it as Json file save it as a Json file yeah because then vs code will pass it so you can see it more better oh okay okay okay okay yeah how do you want to check like uh function by function [Music]",
  "to check like uh function by function [Music] or not a valid Jason not a valid Jason no no I'm thinking why that is correct so the uh bottom at the bottom oh yeah you have an extra uh required addresses and additional properties that's not uh not necessary there okay but that should not cause it to be not a Val without that right yeah just just remove that extra bit and try without it okay okay yeah sure I didn't change uh yeah it uh didn't change yeah I Jon input actually I tried with many",
  "yeah I Jon input actually I tried with many combinations but uh I don't know why I tried with a different uh structure itself like actually of the Json but uh um so um the text area actually like this this exactly matches with the other one like actually all the unmuted things and all like all those other CSS elements are gone but still it appear but not sure so what happens if you just uh I just want to test something just uh remove make it blank and press check yeah yeah sure no no don't",
  "blank and press check yeah yeah sure no no don't don't hit save just sorry sorry check what should we hit here just say check or check the check button yeah oh what's the difference between this okay I okay because the check button gives you it doesn't uh refresh the page or anything it will just U uh check exactly everything on the page without moving it up and down in that oh neat trick thank you thank you is good okay yeah no this is still the same yeah okay okay so [Music] um what do you",
  "the same yeah okay okay so [Music] um what do you think J I think do you think think it's something to do with the element in the Box itself because it looks like it's working right yes I think we can try on our machine yeah but we've tried it right and it [Laughter] works unexpected end of Jesus okay uh do one thing just uh send us your um send us your Json okay we'll examine it and uh get back to you on that okay and uh this one B 64 encryption like encoding uh like is it like U URL U",
  "like encoding uh like is it like U URL U encoding or the payload encoding which one is it expected I tried both but still it uh ah so it is not URL it will be the URI you have to send the URI to it uh let's just scroll up a bit let scroll up okay yeah no no I mean as in in your the answer itself the answer oh sorry sorry okay yeah so okay messages so this is all exactly as the template right yeah yeah these are all from the template yes it is saying this URL must be Bas 64 this one is what I",
  "saying this URL must be Bas 64 this one is what I keep changing uh it is not right yeah so uh like uh what I didn't understand like which one should we encode here like uh yeah so you see this image that is there yeah yeah cor correct you download that image yes and then what you do is you convert this image into base 64 that is this one like this so the way so the way we I'll tell you an easy way to do it if you go back to the the site itself if you scroll up a little bit just scroll up a",
  "if you scroll up a little bit just scroll up a little bit no no I mean yeah just slowly yeah keep going okay yeah keep going keep going yeah keep going yeah sure keep going keep going uh there no uh keep going simplest is just right click on that one and open in new tab the URL is ah there it is there it is so you DC base 64 decoder encoder no no just U just slightly below oh yeah okay just use that encoder it'll give you the correct output nice okay there's a tool okay so here what do we do",
  "okay there's a tool okay so here what do we do actually like uh yeah you just uh have to upload your file and um and then it will work it will convert it that's the one is it uh just go back to that page again this one oh no no that one that one yeah that it converts it into Ur So upload the file okay and um leave all the settings as is it'll give you the exact correct URI that you're supposed and it'll work okay okay okay that's fa okay the other one is um which one is this one one is okay so",
  "one is um which one is this one one is okay so this I was able to use yesterday uh as uh you guys suggested the token but uh I give that token giving the embedding but um uh so this is the one actually like uh so the token works and it's able to do a call so it no longer gives that uh uh overloaded error but uh with the same Json I pasted I get the first input does not match for the text is there some structure is expecting I can I can show the code uh this is the one actually like this is the",
  "code uh this is the one actually like this is the code and uh it's the same engine actually like it's the same uh the thing which they have mentioned actually is there something wrong okay so um they if you go back to your assignment itself assignment okay yeah yeah okay and um so the issue is oh wait this is which question question five is it five okay one second yeah sure sure take your time okay so question five uh where is it sorry I lost the window okay so question five asks um you to send",
  "window okay so question five asks um you to send uh response sorry send um um send a Json body uh to your API right so but if you scroll down here yeah this this uh this response is not what is expected you this is not what you would send you don't send the embedding itself right the the API is supposed to give you the embedding back oh this is the output you mean this is yeah what youput is the output we not asking for the output we're asking you what you will send to get the embedding oh oh",
  "you what you will send to get the embedding oh oh okay that's what the question is is it okay yeah yeah oh sorry your task is to write the Json body for the Post request to send to the API to obtain the text embed okay okay I'm already sending that uh J yes so I just have to give that Json here you have to just give the input Jon input Json okay okay sorry my bad my bad uh yeah okay I I'll do that thank you thank you so much and then this one is working as um uh okay yeah this one I tried it",
  "is working as um uh okay yeah this one I tried it like uh a lot like actually this is similar to that seventh one but uh uh the token doesn't work like that that place the token worked AR token here the AR token doesn't work um I I do not know actually like just uh um it says it's not from a valid issuer uh can you show the URL that you using to send request uh yeah sure um uh what was the number s right yeah this is the one okay um so this is the URL that you are using to send request right",
  "the URL that you are using to send request right yeah last time it worked for the 3.5 I showed you right that it worked okay uh can you append embeddings to it at the end embedding one minute actually like this is the base URL yeah to the base URL append embedding okay uh okay wait wait wait before do that can you show me the requesting part where you are sending a request to open here this is the one actually get embedding this is the call okay instead of doing it this way what you would have",
  "instead of doing it this way what you would have to do you have to send a request using request module using headers and all those informations yeah I mean this what you're using is actually open ai's own uh um uh Library uh yeah yeah yeah yeah that will not work actually you will have to use request module and uh send the request just like um you you know you would expect with the examples that are shown so there'll be a URL there'll be a header there'll be a payload if you use their own",
  "header there'll be a payload if you use their own Library it will not constructed correctly the because the proxy proxy has its own uh method of doing some of these functions that don't match open AIS but for 3.5 it worked I mean it might that was more like a coincidence than anything else but uh but if you used uh the documentation that that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided there's a documentation there if you use that documentation then um that I tried to check where is you go",
  "then um that I tried to check where is you go back to yeah if you go back to where you get the token a token yeah one this is one yeah so down below that yeah if you go there that's the documentation so if you go down so you'll have to provide um the documentation in this form oh sorry the call you'll have to make yeah but you'll use the request instead of using curl commands yeah yeah you just use the requests and then send these inputs to it got it I'll do that thank you thank you so much",
  "got it I'll do that thank you thank you so much that's what the problem is there that's that's good that's very good um is this this one is say uh now this is done actually n91 okay so oh my God this one was like oh this is really fascinating question like okay anys actually I think it's a problem to us I guess it just somehow you have to make it actually I just tried so many answers it's like I don't know if there's a trick for this like this is a yeah this was in Roe last last term actually",
  "is a yeah this was in Roe last last term actually this question oh so interesting question so answer is there is a way there in fact many ways to get it to say yes I see okay you just have to I don't know trick it into saying yes okay I shall I shall keep trying no that's fine this is a very just look up previous discourse posts you will you'll probably find suggestions on there as well like from last time okay okay okay but uh yeah this was interesting can I get the code for this like uh like",
  "can I get the code for this like uh like how he constructed like uh yeah he will uh I think it that didn't he provide that in a discourse post J yeah someone have pasted on discourse yeah yeah the he I think yes of how he if if not we can always ask him to provide it but I know we have seen it uh but I don't remember if he only showed it to us or if he put it on discour I think he put it on discourse afterwards I'm not entirely sure but uh I I want to thank you this nice interesting problems",
  "want to thank you this nice interesting problems you guys have course is something different than I've taken one more course that uh something on business VA or something like that that I don't know there is no GA at all for this there is a ga but you don't submit here these two coures are somewhat different right right okay okay uh let's yeah no worries yes manmit carry on you can ask your question thank you sir sir um when I joined I'm sorry I joined late but enro error was being shown by",
  "I joined late but enro error was being shown by someone and um I'm also getting uh I think very similar error I couldn't follow the discussion at all I joined towards the end so I'll share my screen uh just before you share your screen was it giving you a cloud cloud flare uh it said traffic was successfully tunneled to the enro agent but the agent failed to establish a connection to the Upstream web service I can share and okay yeah you can share your screen I think your problem is slightly",
  "your screen I think your problem is slightly different okay and I'm really struggling with all the questions so it takes hours and hours for me to do these just if it's any consolation to you it takes us time as well CU these were fairly new to us as well oh okay I I thought I have zero experience very new to all this but um thanks okay so with like hours of work I was able to run the Llama file and then figured out somehow that I should install enro and uh it did uh and I can I'll move to the",
  "enro and uh it did uh and I can I'll move to the error uh this is the error when I uh try to run it J you want to have a back at this one I'm having a look at documentation for error code at col uh sorry I my audio wasn't working uh did you ask me to paste this no no noing we we looking up the error code okay okay Sor so that's something uh generally we do whenever we come across an error um we look up what that error actually means I clicked on this and couldn't understand can you open uh",
  "on this and couldn't understand can you open uh terminal where you are running local host 80 yeah oh the the Explorer you're saying or the where okay where the terminal you said sorry yeah uh is this this is one thing that is running uh shall I run it and for llama it gives me that 8080 here and I clicked and it opened on the server and then this is giving bad gateway okay uh can you open the Llama one this one yeah just open the server URL okay from here yeah okay this works can you go back to",
  "from here yeah okay this works can you go back to yeah and uh where are you running enro from uh it took me a while to one second it's it was initially not getting yeah it's here on uh sorry on this UB 2 it installed and then it started but on Powers shell I thought maybe I should try here here it's not working I don't know okay okay that is because you are trying to connect to a port of Windows machine through uh enro I mean you are running local host on Windows machine and you are trying to",
  "host on Windows machine and you are trying to connect to it through WSL that's why just try to install enro in your Windows machine and then create a tunnel using from there I I tried I tried Chu I don't know what to use here okay three maybe I can try I don't know what's the exact I tried downloading the file and uh running it it's an executable file it downloads but oh uh okay this one it opened requirement already satisfied next I should uh configure with this o token it's also done just try",
  "with this o token it's also done just try to see if okay okay try just enter this one yeah oh now it's giving me a bad to so one second uh to go to that that is because I think the way it works with python module maybe you have to create a python script and then you have to execute that script oh I don't know that but uh shall I do it again here I have to run a python script you said I think what you have to do you have to uh you so what you have installed using pip is a python module so you",
  "installed using pip is a python module so you would have to create a python script and use that script so I will just provide the documentation can you open this documentation the which one sir I have pasted it in chat window chat okay okay yeah just scroll a bit down yeah uh little bit down so you would have to import enro like this and then scroll a bit more down uh more down so I think this is the way you connect to it nr. forward and then you would need to provide token I don't exactly know",
  "would need to provide token I don't exactly know how to do this it is first time I'm using it uh just scroll a bit more down so you so this is en gr. forward and then 4242 I think this is the way you connect to it this one uh so I have to change something for Lama file to 42 42 or yeah try this out which means I have to start from here uh yes okay um J I was just wondering I mean there is uh when I look on nro's documentation there is a downloadable executable with zero depend zero runtime",
  "executable with zero depend zero runtime dependencies for Windows on there that might yes executable is there I'm using that might be just the simpler thing to do because then everything will work just as expected uh I think I downloaded one second so if you go to I'll just uh send you the URL of the site this is this file that you're referring to so if you go uh I'm not not sure but if you go to the um URL that I've put in in chat okay yeah oh it's executable yeah and if you go yeah so if you",
  "it's executable yeah and if you go yeah so if you go scroll down that's a that's a direct installation without any dependencies and then you can just run config add token and it will work I tried this it did not work I but I can can I quickly try yeah yeah yeah yeah we can try it it's yeah it's not uh it's not running maybe I should extract and try uh yeah yeah you have to extract it's a zip I thought it would uh yeah so yeah yeah okay so um basically from this location you can run the enro so",
  "from this location you can run the enro so you give it you say yeah you say engro and you give it those uh first you do the enro config ad to auen Au token and then give the token and then enro give it the server details that you want to run into okay I but it has to but it has to be run yeah okay but um I think it did not work because you have to run it from this location only because that's where the file yeah and now I have to say enro HTTP 880 or should I should I yeah so it's working now",
  "880 or should I should I yeah so it's working now uh is it giving me an error I think I've tried all this um same same is okay so the account is limited to one simultaneous session you've got another session running somewhere uh I think that is inside VSS WSL yeah okay I stopped that also to because I also thought that maybe let me check okay not still running I stopped this so I'll redo that one so that's yeah I'll try this yeah that's exactly how it showed me now no no what uh do you have any",
  "it showed me now no no what uh do you have any other server running at the moment on that same port I me you you're not audible your voice is breaking hello uh yeah Caron you're audible yeah no she she's not audible we can't hear her I think there is some Network ER issue yeah I mean so her enro is running I think from what we saw uh but uh it is listing all the directories why it is doing this that's because some sort of HTTP server is running right uh that's why it's listing all the",
  "running right uh that's why it's listing all the directories but uh interestingly it's listing directories where at root hello am I audible yeah you're audible now uh I have an error here yeah this is a cloud flare error isn't it this is different from the previous error but uh is your NG Rock working now let me check yes uh but the page should show me yeah the Llama one second that that's taking me down to a directory listing instead of uh this so it's where is your Lama running where is your",
  "so it's where is your Lama running where is your L running yeah one second I'll open that here oh this is running inside your Ubunto as well yeah that's that's the reason cuz your NG rock is running outside this is not open to I mean the PS uh Power shell okay okay sorry I could not make out from your screen it's hard for me also sorry yeah yeah okay this is probably working yeah it's working local version of it okay I can restart llama as well because that's what I've been trying restarting",
  "because that's what I've been trying restarting this and that alternatively but uh no no this is fine I mean it's working on 127 so it's running on your Local Host what's the um can you show me the NG Rock again what's it running on NG uh one second 4 4 is it changed no no here it says 8 oh did you re uh so whenever you redoy you will get another URL so are you using this particular URL 6 A8 a iph 2406 in my where do I need to use this uh in browser or While submitting answer can you open While",
  "or While submitting answer can you open While submitting answer I used this one and um it again has an error Okay click on visit sorry I click visit site and this is how it okay that's a new one I've not come across this one before okay then I've been struggling on for it the entire but yeah yeah but we've uh We've made some progress we've got your NG Rock working within Windows now thanks um we just got to figure out why does anyone have any suggestions uh can you visit Local Host 881s if it",
  "uh can you visit Local Host 881s if it helps I can refresh this no no Local Host yeah because it might be different from 127 that's always possible yeah so Local Host is not1 127.0 do1 on your system so what was that zero I don't know how many uh no no this one no no it's one so one two so it's 127.0 do yeah yeah yeah these two I'm able uh if this I take it to ENC and and instead of just saying 8080 if I put the entire thing that might work yeah yes yeah now give it a shot now I think it will",
  "yes yeah now give it a shot now I think it will work no no go go on yeah go on the umro yeah URL sorry no no just just go to the enro URL let see yeah I mean I didn't put it in the browser yeah just put it in theow the I should do the exact control yeah yeah because we want to see yeah we want to verify do a sanity check that it's actually working yes it's working thank you congratulations yeah thank you so much you can't believe how what a relief it is after so much work and with all your help",
  "it is after so much work and with all your help thank you so much you might still yeah yeah no no this is okay because this is a cloud flare error this is a different issue but we have verified that your enrock works it's just that there's a cloud flare at the I had an extra space probably but I'm going to quickly save this and yeah okay fantastic thank you very very much yeah yeah no worries okay uh it's 1010 now um do anyone else have any uh problems that you want us to look at okay so the",
  "problems that you want us to look at okay so the agenda for tomorrow's session uh Thursday Friday and Saturday uh so Saturdays will be a morning session um the agenda will be to cover up uh week three modules uh content wise so we'll be talking about most of the things that U we were trying to solve today here but we'll be talking in depth about these particular topics so that's uh that's all from us for tonight um you guys can have a good evening and thanks for joining thank you very much and",
  "and thanks for joining thank you very much and for tomorrow um we need to come prepared I mean haven't gone through the week three at all so is it still yeah I mean it is uh it's going to cover these uh cover llms right so um that's what we'll be talking at depth I mean I introduced the topic in the previous session um but then we'll you know we'll just uh go in depth into you know what embeddings are and what function calling is and those sorts of things the things that youve already been",
  "of things the things that youve already been doing in the ga so if you've already done the ga then you're kind of already got to grips with how it works uh but maybe you know you you'll be able to understand it a bit uh deeper from a functional point of view what's the what's the purpose of it or not so uh yes saki you wanted to ask something yes sir actually I'm having the same error in the versal question okay uh after uh trying to given uh using the given example as well okay you can share",
  "the given example as well okay you can share your screen yeah yes sir sir is it visible yes sir sir I'm having this uh error and I'm running the file using this I've created the uh repository and I've also initialized the G uh let me show you first JJ I've got another meeting to go to so you'll be able to take over the session H sure sure okay thanks uh good night everyone I'll see you tomorrow good night Colton good night Sir Sir so is my screen is visible sir oh yeah your screen is sir I have",
  "is visible sir oh yeah your screen is sir I have uh run that this is uh where I create the directory sir if it H okay uh and after that I've get into the directory and then I've after that I've initialized the git uhhm and after that I've installed the versal but uh it showing some error so I've already installed the veral first so I after that I have run the file uh name as verel and it's asking some questions and I've answered those questions like thish and I'm getting the link this and it is",
  "thish and I'm getting the link this and it is showing error sir when I produce it on the uh web uh just show it is showing the errors sir and last time also it's showing the same error can you go to vs code yes sir so this is the uh just a second sir uh this is the uh python code which I have generate from chat GPT using the given example mhm okay uh can you go back to uh the uh browser yes sir uh can you append back/ API to your url okay can you go back to the vs code yes sir okay okay not to",
  "go back to the vs code yes sir okay okay not to the vs code can you go back to uh versel dashboard yes sir okay um is it uh just open the the project that ah yeah just this one and go to logs just open this error and copy this error that's the oh just copy it and paste it somewhere okay sir just a second I will open Notepad no such file Q okay there needs to be a file for data for reading the data just okay I think so I did not answer okay I did not just a minute sir uh can you wait for a",
  "I did not just a minute sir uh can you wait for a minute sir uh it's not that yes sir I've moved the file in the first we have to remove this uh for uh for running again uh we have to remove this sir do versal folder this one no no you don't need to remove it okay so St so again it's showing the error if I go with that now it's sir it's kind of working I add add I have add the slash back slash API which you have told me last time okay uh can can you go to question uh URL uh question time yes",
  "you go to question uh URL uh question time yes sir try pasting that URL here which URL sir versel URL the one you just uh deployed okay sir just a minute Sir with including back slash API sir yeah okay sir okay uh can you go to veral dashboard yes sir okay can you go to Project page yeah open this up okay can you go to versel hyphen whatever is below domains can you go to that URL yeah this yeah uh just append API to it and some submit this URL [Music] okay uh can you go back to uh vs code yes",
  "[Music] okay uh can you go back to uh vs code yes sir and and over there can you type versel uh space think what is the way to deploy uh can you scroll a bit up yes sir yeah uh okay what is the way to deploy just give me one minute yes L sir okay [Music] um okay uh can you go to vs code again yes sir and type there versal space deploy space hyphen hyen p o hyphen hyen PR o okay hit enter and after it builds and it deploys just go to verel dashboard yes sir uh now can you go to this URL okay",
  "yes sir uh now can you go to this URL okay this is same URL just click on the check button on uh on G2 page on G2 page just click on check button okay uh can you open inspect tab yes sir uh here sir uh in the yes yes and console Tab and can you hit on check button now just okay uh this is because of codes I think sorry sir this I think this error is because of codes not being enabled uh can you go back to your application can you open uh yeah vs code index. P index. Pi sir yes yes just scroll a",
  "code index. P index. Pi sir yes yes just scroll a bit down just a minute sir okay scroll a bit up yeah uh so over here I think you would have to include a little bit code in headers so that it allows sending request from other uh server words so just ask chat jpt how do I enable course just give this code to GPT and ask how do I enable course the whole code are from the vs code yeah and what should I ask sir uh how do you enable codes course C RS c r s c RS SS yeah that's why I have uh created",
  "c r s c RS SS yeah that's why I have uh created the required requirement. txt file where I added the flask course but uh sir said that that uh I don't need that if I have the example code from the question but here also so what is purpose of code let us say if uh you you are submitting this URL somewhere and from that it tries to request then there you would need to know from where this particular request is coming that's why you would need course uh it would have added one line so self so",
  "course uh it would have added one line so self so these are the two lines that it have added two or three yeah these are three lines okay sir now I will now I'll try to run it sir sir I will uh I should try versal deploy or the original command which I have given earlier what deploy hyper production okay sir should I check on the veral sir that it is it working or sure okay uh yeah so it gets you something but the output that your code is generating is wrong is yes sir it's generating null null",
  "is wrong is yes sir it's generating null null which is wrong yeah so it will uh here in if else Loop where it getting null m uh just try to check for uh I think it um what is the question can you go back to question once yes sir I just scroll a bit up this question so I think what it is doing it is sending some URL encoded parameter I think there might be mistake while reading those parameters just changing that code will help okay so there is a problem with my code where it's fetching null for",
  "problem with my code where it's fetching null for all the data which yes yes should not okay sir sir I'll try this uh once on my own I will uh if uh it is not done then I will ask it tomorrow I think so I can ask her question tomorrow tomorrow also yes you can either ask on discourse okay sir sir actually I posted on discour uh two questions for uh uh from graded assignment deadline one for two days ago but I didn't get any response from anyone that's why I little bit uh confused and that's why",
  "why I little bit uh confused and that's why I'm I ask the question here okay okay okay just post it to discourse I mean just first try it on your own and then post try to respond yes sir sure sir okay uh anyone else have any doubts in ga1 2 or three sir I hav't trying the ga uh 3 but uh if any doubt I can ask in future session yeah yeah okay okay then I will stop the recording now",

  "live session okay I'll be sharing my [Music] screen is my screen visible just give me a thumbs up or just open the mic and just tell me all right yes let's get started with this so uh I'll be talking about the fast API okay and then jaaj will be taking over and then he will be talking about llama and much more stuff okay Rel to G ga3 so basically uh everything related to ga2 has been already covered and uh in uh earlier lectures so uh the only thing which has not been touched yet is this fast",
  "thing which has not been touched yet is this fast API and rest API stuff okay so we'll be looking through this and uh uh okay let's get started so if you guys have attended uh the the live session which took place on I guess uh last Thursday or Friday uh we did a flas flas special tutorial in that live session so I talked about flask and how you can deploy your web apis using flask uh rather than versel okay so uh today we'll be talking about fast API and and what you will realize is that fast",
  "API and and what you will realize is that fast API the syntax of fast API is much more similar to uh flask than to rest rest API okay so uh we'll be looking through this and uh let's create a new uh API okay so I won't be uh downloading this data set and you know solving this question with you because obviously so uh I have downloaded a new data set and uh uh okay so this is the data set actually I requested this data set from a website which uh have some uh data about the world cities or",
  "uh have some uh data about the world cities or something okay so they send me this data set this CSV file and we'll be creating a new flask uh sorry new Fast API application with this okay so let's get started and I'll be creating a new folder okay so before starting with ask API I want to give you guys uh kind of a refresher on what is API because you know uh there are several people who are posting on discourse and uh other sources of uh you know group chat that uh uh they're not able to",
  "know group chat that uh uh they're not able to understand what does API stand for so they're not able to understand how things are communicating with each other and how uh all these you know different components are getting together to create this application okay so first of all I'll be talking about how apis work and what is the actual need of API in our uh J are you saying something yeah so actually someone just raised hand I think shaki yeah yes sir sir I posted on discourse also and I",
  "yeah yes sir sir I posted on discourse also and I mailed the problem I mailed you the problem also actually sir I am facing the same problem which which I have asked earlier yesterday uh wait uh yeah sure uh Shan yeah actually she is facing issue with deploying it uh deploying a fastk application on verell so the issue that she is facing is uh flask module is not getting downloaded on verel so can you just show that verel Json configuration file part okay okay so actually uh when you're are",
  "part okay okay so actually uh when you're are deploying your flask application on versal so there are a few things that you have to keep in mind okay so uh first of all the error that you are uh telling me that seems to be occurring from this requirements. txg okay so uh answer me this uh did you create a new virtual environment for this or did you just install flask on your global environment sir actually first I added a requirement. txt file and in that Ive added class and class course but uh",
  "in that Ive added class and class course but uh C cart sir said that I can use the example which is given in the question uh so so that I uh don't need to uh don't need the file requirement. txt then I'll remove that file and I re um I rewrite the code uh the code is working but I which I'm getting the error right now is that it is giving me the uh giving me the null output uh that it should give me a list of integers the question is asking but I I'm getting a null output you're getting a null",
  "I I'm getting a null output you're getting a null output all right so the flask application is running fine as intended like is it uh you know are you able to see some something happening when you can you just share the screen that would be much more convenient for us to understand yes sir sure sir just a minute sir sure sure okay I've stopped sharing you can share your screen now by the way guys uh in the meanwhile I just want to ask you guys have you tried that optional exercise I told you",
  "have you tried that optional exercise I told you for the flask API that uh zodiac sign one has anyone just tried it anyone the app where the assignment which I gave you guys to you know ask a person's month of birth and and then you have to return the zodiac sign associated with that particular person has anyone done that all right I guess no one okay sir is my screen is visible yeah your screen is visible okay so I understand that you guys might have not you know uh paid any attention paid",
  "have not you know uh paid any attention paid some uh kind of attention to that optional exercise because you know and the GS of TDS are enough to consume your time yes sir that is the main problem actually I from my side sir uh it is the actual problem because the in gas I'm spending almost two days uh two and three days enely acceptable yeah I can relate with that so the G are like they have 18 to 10 10 to 18 questions on an average till now and uh yeah I can understand completely that it's",
  "and uh yeah I can understand completely that it's consuming most of your time but if you get some time and you are in the mood okay so let's I I'm in the mood and I want to create some new application you can simply uh go ahead with that project that was a mini project you can in fact have many more uh types of ideas and you can execute them using flask API that's up to you I just gave you uh you know optional project okay so let's look what sakshi is facing with okay yes sir I'm just uh",
  "sakshi is facing with okay yes sir I'm just uh running the application again uh okay so you are using versal CLI yes sir okay I'm San yeah when writing the tools that we need in the requirements text file do we need to specify the version of the tools that we need yes you have to specify the version but let me tell you that you don't have to you know manually type this requirements.txt it can be easily done using a single line command in Python so uh I guess I will just tell you how to do this",
  "so uh I guess I will just tell you how to do this uh s can you run a command yes sir uh where sir in bash command uh in Powers shell that would be much more better yeah yes sir okay so do you have any virtual environment for this project no sir actually I tried to create a virtual environment but it is showing me some error that's why I have not created it okay so please type in Python space freeze space What sir freeze freeze e okay press enter okay so no search directory okay you haven't open",
  "okay so no search directory okay you haven't open any directory yet okay sir just yeah [Music] yeah should work let me check it once okay so the command is something like that python freeze and then you just you know it puts it Dums out all the requirements required for uh the like it gives you each and every Library that's present in your virtual environment or your global environment and along with that you will get the uh version as well so yeah isn't it P freeze okay I was confused with",
  "yeah isn't it P freeze okay I was confused with that it I was thinking that it should be sorry what was that remove this python yes sir yeah P [Music] pip space freeze z e yeah press enter just enter okay so this will return each and every module that's present in your global environment at the moment okay so if you are using a virtual environment then it will return the libraries which are specifically present in that virtual environment because she is currently using a global environment",
  "she is currently using a global environment that's why it has it's it just returned each and every library in her system okay so uh now how you can you know make a requirements. txt file out of this simple uh can you press the up Arrow key okay so as you can see that the AR key will you know just past the previous command now Enter space greater than sign sir uh currently I'm uh I'm not in the that directory which uh which is in uh which contains the versal file that is I'm just demonstrating",
  "the versal file that is I'm just demonstrating I'm just demonstrating how you can create a requirements txt okay sir okay okay so space and requirements.txt type it out so what it would do is this pip freeze as you saw that pip freeze will you know return all these all this text now what this greater than sign and this name of the file will do it will dump everything each and the entire output into this file so just press enter so now it has it should have been created yeah there is the",
  "has it should have been created yeah there is the requirements. txt can you open this file Bel theal python below no no no not in first in okay lower lower the bot I I'm in the that's actually another requirements of txt so can if you can see this directory over there in her terminal so it's first okay so this is the this is this is how you can create a requirement or TT you never have to type it out okay so uh yeah that's a simple way to create it okay so just one more question then if I'm",
  "it okay so just one more question then if I'm running a virtual environment by UV then it will only copy out the uh tools that are in the virtual environment exactly if you are using UV so that's a downer of UV which I think it is that like whenever you're using using UV you are not installing those uh you know libraries so if you're not installing those libraries it won't be present in your virtual environment and if it is not in your virtual environment then you won't be able to you know dump",
  "then you won't be able to you know dump it out on in requirements or t so that's the downside of UI which I feel uh yeah so like if you have a minor project let's say you don't have to create you don't have to deploy it somewhere you just have to you know run it in your file in your device so that in that case you can use UV but other than that I would I would recommend you to just create a virtual environment and install a libraries in that okay sir it's uh now it's showing nothing I don't",
  "okay sir it's uh now it's showing nothing I don't know actually your server is not running sorry your server is not running can you uh just run this command versal deploy Brad on again they should yeah so uh generally I'm am uh not a big fan of versel CLI I usually use you know just create my projects and then push to GitHub and then establish the connection between uh versal and GitHub so yeah so it's showing you it's showing you blank okay so can you open the dev tools once just right click",
  "can you open the dev tools once just right click over here on the screen yeah no not here on this white screen yeah just right click inspect and go to console can you reload once yes sir okay nothing is showing can you show me the code yes yes sir okay so you are using httpx yes sir actually uh uh yesterday sir told me that I can use the example file which is example code which is given in the question that's why I rewrite the code otherwise I have created uh the requirement txt file and after",
  "created uh the requirement txt file and after that I'm deploying both of them and but this was working yesterday sir it is not showing blank yesterday now I didn't get it why why it is doing sh it was working perfectly yes sir it was uh it was working it is not showing blank the uh error page is showing that this error page is showing but sir told me that add backslash an API then it will uh working it will showing the some data kind of when I entered that uh Link in the question in the",
  "I entered that uh Link in the question in the assignment it give uh it was giving me the null list list containing null uh elements okay yeah that's supposed to happen when you know nothing is showing can you scroll down SC would Beed like this okay scroll scroll okay so you are using course okay scroll okay I would say that you have used a lot of you know uh complexity you just made it a lot of comp a lot more complex actually sir I take a uh I've taken help from J GPT so okay yeah that",
  "a uh I've taken help from J GPT so okay yeah that explains these comments yes sir okay I guess that you don't have uh uh like it's not directing you to somewhere uh also this is uh uh okay sir also one uh question question number nine I don't know how to use class as a variable name as a variable name which question number nine sir in question number nine okay that so I will be talking about that yeah that's one thing which I faced as well I'll be talking about that yes sir because I used un",
  "be talking about that yes sir because I used un but it is giving me the answer uh when I typed uh in the um uh URL uh in the browser but it is not taken at yes because the thing is that it's actually a keyword in Python it won't allow you to use class uh variable yes sir otherwise my code was working uh correctly just the name I'm not getting by how to write it also saki this is uh the Windex yeah so this is also not a flask based code this is more like an HTTP your creating HTTP server that's",
  "like an HTTP your creating HTTP server that's not a flask based application uh okay sir sir uh I'll try to do it again according to the requirement um and add requirement. txt file and try to run it if there uh after that I will um share my screen and say uh give you the okay you can do that also uh the FL based code is not needed right here e just but uh so that I'm bit confused because it was working perfectly uh per not perfectly but it was working last uh yesterday and but can you open can",
  "last uh yesterday and but can you open can you open versel once again yes sir a versal versal the tab in which you have vers uh yesterday was this uh this particular box over here was this showing like uh uh uh the Box was uh the same sir it was showing not found but when I added the back slash API in the URL then it was uh showing the dictionary kind of okay so it was it was returning the Json object what I feel is you yeah what is your folder structure sorry can you show your folder structure",
  "sorry can you show your folder structure once uh just go back to your uh vs code I uh done it uh just I created the directory then I created one more folder API and then I uh created index. py inside the API should I remove that do do versal and again deploy the versal command and create a project name no that won't work because veral CLI has has created that folder so it must contain some build instructions which you which versal has to follow are these versal orj and everything are they",
  "are these versal orj and everything are they inside the API file no uh it is not in the API file it is in the versal python API uh the directory which I created the Json file is in this and uh the index. py file is a is an API that's what that's what in the question mentioned well uh we will have to look it in much more you know to look into it much more depth so for now I will ask in in the last of the CL in last uh for sure for sure until uh until I try to uh yeah just try to you know yeah",
  "until I try to uh yeah just try to you know yeah yes thank you I just saw I just saw a g ignore file do you have GitHub have do you have a GitHub instance working here because I yeah there is G ignore so do you have are you like pushing it to GitHub as well because if you are then you can you know uh see what was your commits and uh what went the wrong way if it if it was working perfectly fine a few days back then you will be able to see what comments that you made and what just you know put",
  "comments that you made and what just you know put it off the track so do you have GitHub uh bro I think I know what's the problem sir over here you're splitting hello yeah yeah I think you're just getting the last parameter here I think you're not getting all the parameters in the API in the question when they send it they send multiple parameters know with name this one is just taking the last one I think you can see it it's on the screen can you run this application once one more once more I",
  "run this application once one more once more I just yeah now go back to Google okay so just yeah just open it once more once again okay now enter that API and now enter some arguments as well question mark name I guess there is a name parameter yeah enter name equals to anything yeah okay so this will give you null uh just go back to your Json file ones the Json file which actually contains your code uh sorry your data yeah uh right click on this right click once and format document that's a",
  "right click once and format document that's a much better way to view this okay just copy this first name any name just copy any name from here okay you have G copy it and now paste this you just remove this and paste this enter okay H I believe that the problem lies in your the way you are actually you know traversing to the Json file guess it's not able to find your Json file and then somehow okay so your Json file is not present in this API folder right uh can you just can you go to the",
  "folder right uh can you just can you go to the fifth line of your code yeah now uh in front of this Q in front of Q yeah double dot and slash okay now save it and run it once again this should work hopefully let it deploy once okay so it's building can you scroll it yeah it's building yeah just wait for it okay so it has connected with your G repo open this URL once again do that exact same thing yeah run it okay uh saki uh can you go to versel uh logs maybe there you can find the actual yeah",
  "uh logs maybe there you can find the actual yeah just go back to verel yeah scroll down yes can you just click on this red yeah click over here scroll down no no not copy it not copy it just scroll down there on the screen yeah just scroll it uh Shan copying and pasting to notepad will give better visibility I think uh all right actually I never do that I just check it right here okay that would work no such directory found okay so it's not able to find this file uh can you remove those uh",
  "able to find this file uh can you remove those uh Slash and dot dot once it was giving option right API okay just run it once again no no just remove that remove it yeah save it and deploy it once again should deploy it once again and then we will see what's the issue it's building it let's wait okay so run that command once again yeah right okay go back to your versal again in that log no no not here on the tab the versal tab that you have opened open it back and check the logs once again okay",
  "open it back and check the logs once again okay so uh click on this red highlighted part cop it yeah let's check it one again uh I guess this is the last logs go back to versal again asaki let's do one thing uh because time is running out of hand let's do one thing uh we can debug this problem after this session okay perhaps we can have a separate meeting and then we can debug this what do you say and let's just move ahead with a fasta okay sure sir okay thank you sir so are we discuss ing",
  "sure sir okay thank you sir so are we discuss ing project sir uh not project we discussing the second last question of G2 the fast API one and then we'll be looking into uh ga3 and jrj will be talking about the uh you know Lama the llms okay so let's get started okay so first and foremost I'll be explaining you guys what does API actually do and what's the role of API okay so that has been a constant question on different platforms and let's address this on okay so for this I would like to uh",
  "this on okay so for this I would like to uh you know show it to you rather than explaining it okay this open so this is actually figma and uh it's used for a multitude of purposes so what we will be doing is we will be I'll be explaining you guys how does apis work in okay so let's create a okay so you guys you don't have to bother with whatever I'm I'm doing you don't have to learn pigma so that's this this is just a tool for me to explain you guys how things work okay if I had uh stylus or",
  "guys how things work okay if I had uh stylus or something I would have you know opened a notebook and you know draw I would have explained it you while writing it okay so let's get started so first and foremost uh whenever we are you know dealing with networks and all we have two components okay so first is the user right first is the user and uh let's mark it once really quickly user first one is the US user and hello does is the no The Voice is not audible anymore yeah the screen seems to",
  "is not audible anymore yeah the screen seems to have Frozen I think his internet just it went out we can even use that analogy right like API is like a waiter and user is just any customer and then the server is weal the kitchen or something whatever request you make API kind of serves it then like I'm going to joke here then course is like adding the ability that the API is not resist anymore par the course allows every kind of system to access the API so you can say that the API is not racist",
  "the API so you can say that the API is not racist anymore hello hello hello that is not not a good joke but still sorry guys I lost connection okay I know it's a PO but it still works British am all right guys if you are finished with a jokes can we focus it was about the analogy that I actually actually whatever saying is that API is like a viter right and it's basically serving you whatever request you are making and the kitchen is the right yeah absolutely so let's take this this enery this",
  "absolutely so let's take this this enery this analogy more further okay so this user uh by the way uh till what point you guys were able to you know see because I lost my connection between explaining so what was the point that I that you lost me you you drew uh this red box and wrote user on it and then your screen froze okay so I also drew a new uh uh box with a server marked okay so it's like uh just like rck and uh one more guy said I sorry I don't remember remember your name so the thing",
  "I don't remember remember your name so the thing is that the users are like you are sitting you are sitting in a restaurant okay and the server is the kitchen okay so the like you are just sitting in a fancy restaurant and the server is actually the kitchen over here okay so what does API actually do is it acts like the waiters just like these two guys just told us so apis act like you uh like waiters and it will just you know fetch out the date it will just fetch out the data from the servers",
  "it will just fetch out the data from the servers and then give it to the users okay and also uh like okay so that's I guess it's a two-way connection uh okay so let's draw a line and uh this is the API line okay so apis are responsible to transfer your data from the server to the users okay just like the waiters we were talking about okay so these are these guys are like the waiters and they just you know take data they just take what request the user has and then go back to the server and then",
  "user has and then go back to the server and then they ask okay boss the user is asking for this this is this things they're asking for this this data kindly give it to me we just give it the server uh you know it also checks few authorization keys and whatnot and uh then it uh if everything is all right it will just give you the data will just give the data to the apis and then then these apis will go back to the user and deliver those data okay so that's the job of apis okay so now uh also I",
  "so that's the job of apis okay so now uh also I will be including the concept of cores over here okay so what does cores do and what why are we going to use scor so uh if you guys have actually you know gone through the entire question so it says that you should use scores otherwise uh they won't be able to mark you they won't be able to use that API okay so uh let me just go back so if you go over here we talking about course okay so what does course do okay so course let me expand my uh worka",
  "do okay so course let me expand my uh worka is like if uh we like as a user are asking the waiter to give us something another person on another table can also ask the waiter to give it that same thing even if they have not ordered it that's a really good analogy okay uh but obviously uh in that analogy the waiter won't give you the won't give the other guy the same order the exact order which was prepared for the user but over here ex copy or something yeah it will give the exact copy okay so",
  "yeah it will give the exact copy okay so uh here we are and uh let me draw let's give it color blue okay okay so this color blue is quite violent okay this is much better I will draw a new text box and so this is our TDS okay so this is our TDS server and the thing is that our TDS server will actually try to you know intercept this kind of intercept this connection and ask for the same thing the user is asking okay so this connection is you know exclusively established between a user and a",
  "know exclusively established between a user and a server okay so just like uh just like there there is a viter who is exclusively assigned to your uh let's say to your desk to your table so in the same way this connection has been established between a user and a server okay so no other person should be able to access what's going on over in in this connection okay but when but whenever we are consider so in TDS what what we are actually doing so a server is actually it's going to fetch the",
  "so a server is actually it's going to fetch the data which was you know prepared for the user from the server okay so you can understand it this way so uh TDS will try to you know go to server hey server boss please give us the exact data which you are delivering to user but Sur will say that you are not the user that that you are not the guy which I just talked with okay so you didn't order this particular dish so I won't give it to you so this is the natural this is the usual response of the",
  "is the natural this is the usual response of the server that it won't allow TDS to go ahead and uh uh you know take this order that was meant for the user so what cores will do is cores is going to you know it's like the user this particular user this particular guy will give the permission to the server that okay this TS is a nice guy as well you can give my order to him no worries I let's say I am uh really nice guy and I I don't mind if someone else have my order so cuse is that permission",
  "else have my order so cuse is that permission which the user will give to the server that okay bro you can give it to any other person as well okay so in this case it's tedious and uh if if you have ever seen a course error whenever you're trying to solve a question or in tedious it will uh you just have to go to the console Tab and then you will be able to see that uh course is not working something like that you will see that there is a server there is a link uh which corresponds with Anand",
  "there is a link uh which corresponds with Anand s's uh it's it's a server which uh uh which which belongs to Anan sir and uh what What's actually happening is that server is actually requesting the server to give to give the exact data which was prepared for the user to itself okay so it's like trying to take that order from you and uh so that's what we actually require to Mark you guys so that's why it's giving that error okay so this is the concept of course and I'll be teaching you guys how",
  "of course and I'll be teaching you guys how you can incorporate into your fast API applications as well okay so this was the concept of apis uh any questions we'll also Mark it here API this is the API and this is our course okay so course and this line is actually course okay this is how they are actually accessing the the data which was prepared okay so yeah please ask a question C is so it's it's it's like the cost should be incorporated in your in in your request the HTTP request absolutely",
  "in in your request the HTTP request absolutely okay uh yeah yeah go ahead so you have to you know mention your code that you are actually giving this permission to any other server or any other person uh whenever you're trying to create this application so if I show you my fast API code which I created before this uh Is Here Yeah here it is before this lecture show it to you okay so this is the course code uh this code this is the cor code over here what we are doing is we are actually allowing",
  "what we are doing is we are actually allowing it so this is this is where we are actually giving him the permissions okay so as you can see that allow Origins so what kind of Origins you want to allow this star means all okay if you are familiar with SQL you might know what does this star mean so uh also if you're familiar with regular expression so that's a pretty common uh symbol for all every everything okay so the star means that you have to allow everyone to access my my dish okay so",
  "to allow everyone to access my my dish okay so everyone in the restaurant is able to you know take the dish that was prepared for you and uh uh allow method so it allows you it's allow it allows anyone to you know access any method so methods are basically like get post put so these are like you know HTML verbs you need not go into much depth of that so allow headers what does allow headers mean so any person can give any headers so they can you know give cookies they can give authorization",
  "you know give cookies they can give authorization Keys whatever they want to okay so this star means that but let's say but for this particular application I just you know put it to Star but if you are more you know if you're more cautious about your application let's say if you are you know you have a connection with this application somehow then what you can do is you can go ahead and and you know run you can goad to the TDS page you can try running it without course and then it will then",
  "running it without course and then it will then just open console Tab and it will show you that uh it's giving us a cuse error then and then you will and there you will find the actual link of uh Anan sir's server which is actually trying to you know access this uh dish that was prepared for you what you can do is you can simply copy it and paste that particular link over there instead of you know allowing everyone these six lines of cod seeing the same thing yeah please please ask a question",
  "the same thing yeah please please ask a question so these six line of codes are will be common across all the like what yeah this is like this is specifically for fast API for uh let me show you for flask what I did so you know each and every framework has its own way of incorporating course into its code so this was the way for fast API uh when it comes to uh flask I guess uh okay it's not present here okay U it was something like that so uh if you just you know Google it or search on chat gbt",
  "you just you know Google it or search on chat gbt so it will give you also yeah Library called yeah flas there is an entire library for FL course I am not able to find where I actually used it I I used it somewhere not able to find it anyway so uh whenever you like let's say you are creating an application with the rest API and you have to use FL and you have to use let's say course simply ask gbt Hy dude I'm using uh I'm creating an application using this just give me the code for course it's",
  "using this just give me the code for course it's you know uh it's a few lines of code and it will just configure that per those permissions for you okay so this is for fast API uh if you try to use them in flask it won't work obviously because this is made for fast API okay so let's get started uh with our fast API tutorial uh it's already okay uh let's get started I will create a let's go to so where does this uh uh fast API or or floss comes after the API thing like where like where does it",
  "after the API thing like where like where does it connction the thing is that you know uh like let me uh if I talk about myself I'm much more uh comfortable using flask rather than API or rust API is like R API what asking what I'm asking is for example API you told that uh it's kind like it's kind of application program interface and you are like making HTTP requests for the data which you need I'm asking yeah where like uh where does this uh part part of fast API and uh flask fits in U like I",
  "part of fast API and uh flask fits in U like I If you're asking me that like where this preceding preceding uh so following the API thing where does it fit in for example following the API so this is where we are creating apis so like we are not okay okay okay we are creating our own API this where creating apis the fast API is a method to create apis flask is a method to create apis rest API is a method to create apis flask is actually much more flask actually allows you to create a back end",
  "flask actually allows you to create a back end entire back end so it's a you know multi-purpose Library you can create a lot of things with flask flask allows you to create uh you know apis it allows you to create an entire back end like there is a whole lot of thing with flask and uh you know when you go towards the you know Big Brother of flask which is called D Jango so that's another so that's a entire world of things that you can do with Jango okay being said that uh do we need to know a",
  "okay being said that uh do we need to know a little bit of nodejs as well in this uh I I don't think so okay because whatever you are going to do can be done with flask there is no need for that okay I will be honest that uh I first of all I tried to solve this uh there was a question back in I guess first assignment where no no this versal one so uh we had to use something for the API part yeah we had to use httpx if I'm not wrong yeah we had to use this particular line of code but what I did",
  "use this particular line of code but what I did was I just created using flask I did not bother using you know learning this uh new library I just created using flask so uh let's say you have got a new question in uh in your TDS let's say Roe or something and you are required to create an API so what I will suggest you rather than focusing on everything let rather than focusing on Fast API flask and rest GPI and versal you should focus on one thing for instance my focus is entirely on flask if",
  "for instance my focus is entirely on flask if I am tasked with creating an API I will do it with flask that's the best way for me fast API okay if for the purpose of the for the purpose of this tutorial I'm teaching flask API but fast API but if I am tasked with creating an API I will create it using flask so I would say take one thing and uh you know just go ahead with that okay so let okay so you have raised your uh hand please ask your question vas P Mr vikas Pandi please ask your question",
  "vas P Mr vikas Pandi please ask your question yeah actually so I wanted to ask how can I get the address you told you just mentioned earlier how we can get unan address so we can put as a variable uh for that like you know you have to create uh application without having anything related to course and uh then simply you know try running it then go to console because if you will run it without course it will give you an error go to console then you can check uh where is like there is there would",
  "can check uh where is like there is there would be an entire error containing that course is not available this this this this and un anwers uh that particular link would be available there so you can just copy it from that so it's like you know twisting your arm to reach something uh something like that okay so that that I just wanted to verify it actually I I had that idea but I I thought it shouldn't be that simple so I just thought to verify it from you that that's pretty simple because",
  "it from you that that's pretty simple because because for probably what the what that line that some say some questions are hackable this is probably an example of that I will is I will be honest that when I read that online in G1 I guess it was in G1 I tried to hack it I tried to look like is there a bug in the No No it's it's even even even even trying to go through the error right and then figuring out this is the URL you need it's it's kind of hacking right it's like what is hacking it's",
  "of hacking right it's like what is hacking it's like trying to no hacking hacking is what in in terms of you know you're trying to solve something repeatedly right and then there is a connotation key it is related to cyber security in terms of you're trying to bed systems that is obviously there but also like you have hackathons are you hacking in hackathons you are hacking right but in a separate way in that well when we are mentioning hacking so out of out of context so it will be understood",
  "so out of out of context so it will be understood in that way yeah that is why I explained because out of context yes it will be cyber security okay so if you have no questions for further about this let's move ahead with fast API okay so uh uh okay all right so what I did was I created a new environment so that's something which I always do when whenever I'm trying to you know start a new project so that's the best policy always create a new environment so uh the error which shti was facing I",
  "so uh the error which shti was facing I you know I feel that that's something related to this U you have to create create a you know environment and then you should always create a requirements of txt file so uh that's what I recommend okay so I'll be creating a new virtual environment I have done this before as well in live sessions but if you have uh if you don't know how to create a virtual environments just pay attention Okay so for creating a virtual environment simply write python DM V en",
  "a virtual environment simply write python DM V en EnV VV stands for virtual environment okay and then the name of your EnV you can created and you can you know put any name I can even type in TDS for instance but I love this name of En simple and sweet uh yeah please answer please ask a question so actually there in know I saw in a YouTube video that the person was opened a directory which was his G GitHub directory and so like in this in this case where it's it is showing e it is showing e and",
  "where it's it is showing e it is showing e and then the whole path of your directory which is present in your system but in in that in that video it was showing github's repository basically it's his repository or the file that he had opened and it was something like g g Dash this the repository name and then the whole file type something that would have been the git bash he must have connected his GitHub entirely with his you know the the get inside his machine so that can be done uh I'll be",
  "inside his machine so that can be done uh I'll be honest I don't know how to do that how to you know entirely submerge your GitHub with your git uh I will have to look into that uh but yeah that's can be done that can be done using the git bash so what is more convenient uh I think that would is it is that more convenient like you're directly integrating your GitHub and creating files there only and then upgrading it so that way it will save space from your local system also uh I don't think",
  "from your local system also uh I don't think that it will save system you know space of your local system because you have to create files in the local system before pushing them to get okay yeah yeah okay yeah so it won't say file but I guess that it's something related to you know uh uh like whenever some some person is uh like running a specific task multiple times then they must have Incorporated git with you know their entire system I'm not much aware aware about that but I know that it's",
  "much aware aware about that but I know that it's pretty much possible using the kit command using the kit bash okay and and one more thing sorry but I observed that you not you're not using UV for creating the virtual environment so is there any specific reason that you have switched to python only or is it U won't be U won't be able to create this virtual environment if I'm not wrong because this is a which can which should be you know run with python UV is something which will allow you to",
  "python UV is something which will allow you to run your you know it will allow you to run your python files uh without installing libraries that's the one used case of UI which I have come across but apart from that I don't think that it it's much more useful in that more be able to create it if you if you like if you type UV do when UV space when then it would it will and the environment name then it will also create an environment in this Cas okay yeah what it was UV uv. ven ven VNV yeah V",
  "okay yeah what it was UV uv. ven ven VNV yeah V sorry V okay okay okay uh all right so that's news to me as well that's pretty good that I'm not sure can you please run it like I tried it last time so it did I think I would try to run it in another folder because I'm mess with other things I'm sorry to take your time it's just uh I'm confused so a little I should have simply CMD okay so it was UV UV space V and okay I have to create a new virtual environment so I I would have to create a new",
  "environment so I I would have to create a new virtual environment to install UI and uh that would come in the whole that is not necessary that is not sorry sorry for the effort then yeah you can continue sorry all right all right so uh like UI is a good tool but uh I would not use it much because it always creates problems with uh you know creating a requirements or txt file uh all right so we can still install like uv. install UV do UV py pip do install and that can yeah it works faster than",
  "do install and that can yeah it works faster than pip I in my opinion then yeah it works faster than pip okay okay okay so the next step for so as you can see that the virtual environment has been created now the next step is activating it okay so how you can activate it simple type EnV then press tab okay so it will complete it for you then enter s again tab then a again Tab and then PS1 so this is the exact command which you have to write type it out okay so you can simply type it out or you",
  "it out okay so you can simply type it out or you can you know just enter the first letter of the uh next uh substring and then press tab so it will just complete it for you okay so this has activated my virtual environment for me so what I will do is I will install few things which is uh pip install I will install fast API then I will install UV ion so this is not U movie which we were talking about okay also I'll be installing Paras okay why Paras because I would be using a CSC file and uh I",
  "because I would be using a CSC file and uh I will be you know filtering out data using pandas okay it's it's thing let's wait for it all right I will create a new file okay exert this let's name it first dop okay so it has installed everything which we need and now I'll be importing uh flask oh sorry uh fast API I will just copy code from my file okay so this is the code this is the this how you import flask also so there is one thing that uh whenever I'm trying to you know uh whenever I'm",
  "whenever I'm trying to you know uh whenever I'm trying to run fast J my device always you know starts to lag I guess there's something involved with that but uh uh let's I I will check it once after this tutorial okay so uh the rest of the procedure for creating a fast it's much more you know similar okay uh to flask okay so if you know about flas so it won't be much difficult for you to adjust with fast GP okay so uh I will just leave out this part because this is okay let's just copy it okay",
  "part because this is okay let's just copy it okay so this is the part where we uh incorporate course we are actually giving permission to other sources to access our file okay or to access our you know connection and uh so this is the uh the library this is the particular module that we are going to use for course okay and this is the command and how did I you know where did I found it CH GPT I just simply wrote just gave me the course code for fastp and just and it just gave me and uh the",
  "for fastp and just and it just gave me and uh the proof of that is this is these you know comments no one write these if there is comments in your uh file then either you are a really dedicated programmer you like to comment everything or you have just copied it from chat GP so no shame in that okay so let's move ahead and uh let's go ahead with creating a new endpoint okay so and C this so what we are going to do is I will uh back here and where it is it is okay guess I would find it in my",
  "it is it is okay guess I would find it in my download space downlo yeah no it's not here okay so I actually know got a file which contained few things about the cities okay so it's not able to reach web page okay this was something which I actually faced after running fast API in my device few hours later few hours earlier as well so I guess it's something related to fast API or uh like it's a heavy module which is consuming a lot of my resources okay uh let me find I guess somewhere like here",
  "okay uh let me find I guess somewhere like here okay where it is f okay reached okay let me see if I have another data set with me then perhaps we can do it see let's see let's see let's see okay while ranges it's not working uh unfortunately I I guess I lost that data somehow or is it on the textop I guess it's in the it's not here as well okay I just copy it from here and let's paste it here yeah paste okay so this is our entire so this is actually a machine learning data set which I had and",
  "a machine learning data set which I had and uh because I lost my data set that's why I'm going to use this one okay let's open it and I will give you an overview of what we're going to do okay it's okay it's tire that kind OFA set okay try close okay all right let's create our own data set because my machine has betrayed me somehow okay I will create a new Excel file and I will name it let's say uh data because why not and uh let's open this and uh the name so let's say I will name it City okay",
  "uh the name so let's say I will name it City okay and then the population so this was actually the data which I downloaded but know it some of betrayed me and I will write few cities let's say Delhi Chennai Kolkata and uh what Mumbai can take foreign cities as well Berlin Frankfort it is Frankfort okay so these are the uh few cities let's enter some random numbers okay some random numbers so these are the populations of these cities let's let's say Tokyo as well because why not by the way do",
  "say Tokyo as well because why not by the way do you guys know that Tokyo is a number one city when it comes to population it's highly populated city more than Delhi I guess Delhi comes in the second place okay so this is a data prepared I will save it as a CSV and then okay save as a CSV and okay okay save it all right it's done so we have a CSV file as you can see that this is the data. CSV and now let's go back to FL oh sorry fast uh okay and our data is prepared now we can do some stuff with",
  "data is prepared now we can do some stuff with Okay so so I'll be creating a new endpoint okay so the process of creating a new endpoint it's fairly similar to flask okay uh the only difference is that we are adding this async keyword over here so what does this async means async basically means that your this function would be running asynchronously so what does asynchronously mean you can just uh like it means that multiple processes can run at a time rather than you know uh it rather than",
  "at a time rather than you know uh it rather than you know focusing on each and every task for an entire duration it will focus on every task it's kind of like that okay so you can just simply search what does asynchronous mean or otherwise you can just ignore it okay so it's we will add this async keyword right in front of this function okay and now uh what I will do is let me check if I am doing it right or not okay so it's right so one problem which I faced with uh this this particular code",
  "which I faced with uh this this particular code so u in this flask API in this fast API code that that's given over here so one problem which I faced was that whenever I was trying to you know reload stuff so whenever I I was making some changes it wasn't reloading the entire server it wasn't reloading the entire file so that was one you know downside which I are faced with but perhaps it was my mistake most probably but uh then I sorted then I just resorted to using some other way of running a",
  "resorted to using some other way of running a fast API file okay so should okay so uh this is done now how you can run this fast API file for this you have to execute a certain command which is UV icon okay so this was if you guys remember that this is the uh library that we installed okay uvi and uh then the name of your file fast and then app so just you can just remember this fast colon app okay and then reload okay so this is the way I used it if you guys can you know find out another ways",
  "it if you guys can you know find out another ways to run a fast AP file then we just welcome to do that as well okay I will run this and it will start a server and as you can see that obviously it's showing me not found but when I will go to the API right over here it's showing me hello world okay so it works exactly like flask it will return whenever you're going to this particular end point so this is an end point if you're going to this particular end point it will give you this so it's",
  "end point it will give you this so it's going to return you this particular message okay this is how it works now what we're going to do is because we are asked to uh take parameters as well so the way to take parameters in fast API is simply write the name of your parameter okay uh I will give it City okay and then the type of the parameter you are using okay so it's City and then STL okay so this is the type the type of the variable that we are going to use now you can simply pass it and",
  "are going to use now you can simply pass it and let's say instead of hello world I want to say hello and then the city's name okay this is the city I'll save it and uh I will pass it a city parameter let's say daily and it's saying me and it's you know grading Delhi okay you can change it to any other thing it can be you know uh let's say uh Patna willner as well okay it's also if I just enter my name it will work for my name as well okay so this is how this works uh this is taking a parameter",
  "is how this works uh this is taking a parameter uh right over here this question mark means that you're passing a parameter and then it's using that parameter for some stuff now the question which shti asked was that how can we use this how can we use the class parameter over here okay for instance in TDS we are asked to pass parameters with the name of class right but the problem over here is so this is the uh it should it should pass parameters with class name okay so the problem with python",
  "with class name okay so the problem with python is that it won't allow you to use this variable name okay because it's a keyword and it won't allow you so how we can do this uh let me head back to my code okay so for that you have to create you have to have a different variable name so I entered this variable I just zoom in once Okay so So I entered this uh variable name of class name so this is the variable name and then what I did was I gave it an alias so I will be explaining what does this",
  "an alias so I will be explaining what does this mean well let me let me just explain this okay so the thing is that whenever you are trying to you know uh pass multiple parameters with the same name because uh in this question we are asked to you know uh it will give us multiple parameters can you see this that it will you know pass multiple parameters yes okay so it will pass multiple parameters with the same name but the values will be different so it will be class equal to this then class",
  "so it will be class equal to this then class equal to this then the problem arises is that it won't allow you to give this it won't allow you to you know pass multiple uh uh multiple uh values for a same parameter so for that purpose you have to use list okay and uh for using list we have to use we have to import it from this type thingss uh library and how do I know this chat GPT my friends simple okay whenever you are stuck use chart GPT but also learn from this okay so that that's the one",
  "also learn from this okay so that that's the one callary you should always learn from chart GPT whenever it gives you an answer okay so uh you have to import this and then you have to use this list over here and then we are using this query so this query basically uh it's acting like uh it will take all these you know all these strings that we are passing and then it will Club it into one list okay and this default it basically means that whenever like like for instance if you haven't passed",
  "like like for instance if you haven't passed any parameter then it will take this uh as said default it will take default by by default a list uh an an an empty list okay and Alias basically Alias means that you are giving it another name okay so the name of the variable is class name but we can use class the class parameter using this Alias okay so that's the way of using it all right so uh let's head back to our code because uh okay so I will enter the VAR which is City now what we're going",
  "enter the VAR which is City now what we're going to do is we'll be using pandas okay because now you saw that we are able to you know use this city whatever the whatever parameter the user passes we can use it okay so we are able to use it what else remains simply filtering out the data from this particular file okay and how we will do this simple import uh simple uh you know just import this data set into your file using Paras so uh let's import it okay I will name it data and BD dot uh okay",
  "it okay I will name it data and BD dot uh okay so I'll be asking you guys for this it has given me the answer all right so I thought I will be asking you about what should come next but it actually uh completed it for me okay so it has given me this data if I try to print it you can see that this data is working I will just rerun it once again and you can see that it has printed that entire data which was in the CSV file right so we are able to access this data from this python file and now we",
  "access this data from this python file and now we can use it okay so uh I'll be performing few functions okay so any one of you tell me how can I filter this data how can I filter let's say if I passed the parameter as delh how can it filter it what's the code for it just tell me that anyone it's a data frame so you can just F you can just like do those like data and then square brackets and then all right anyone else theck anyone else all right so I'll be telling you how to do this so I guess",
  "so I'll be telling you how to do this so I guess that uh most of you guys are not much familiar with pandas and I guess that's a gap vaa should Bridge as well uh so perhaps we should have an entire dedicated session to pandas sometime uh or you know we can create a session an entire tutorial for pandas and you know upload it to our weekly content okay so we will we look into that and yeah so check out the cheat sheet which you shared yeah yeah he Shar he shared some resources for Paras okay so",
  "Shar he shared some resources for Paras okay so I'll be going ahead with in with you know just fetching out the data so what we're trying to do is we will be returning the name and the population associated with this okay so I will be uh okay so what I will do is I will create a new variable let's say population so this is our new variable and what I will do is I will okay so it has completed this code for me all right no need to write it so this is actually filtering so this is actually how we",
  "is actually filtering so this is actually how we are filtering out data from this data frame from this table I'm not using the word data frame it's a table okay so it will filter it out and uh you know give the answer so that's one uh plus point of using you know codm or you know giup copilot so it always helps you guys okay can we use function also sorry sorry to interrupt but can we use Query function also yeah absolutely we can use Query function as well like can you show show the I've not",
  "as well like can you show show the I've not used query function but I've seen it somewhere in fact I I haven't used function myself so uh I use it very less but yeah there is a function so okay so it's working like this I guess this should work uh let comment it out I will duplicate it and comment it out once and then we can run this okay so let's rerun this with the name of a city okay okay it has given something okay city is not defined I guess it should be City and okay so the name is City",
  "it should be City and okay so the name is City okay okay this should once again let give me okay city is not defined somehow okay so the problem is here I changes there okay let's run this all right so query par query function is working as well so we have got the entire the row where the city was there okay so what we can do is we can simply extract the population using this okay let's see work yeah it's working perfectly fine so it has returned me the population of De okay so uh this was",
  "me the population of De okay so uh this was using uh pandas and pandas actually you know it's used for data so I just zoomed it out zoomed in for you guys so this is how it actually works for pandas yeah please ask you a question uh so do we need to mention values uh square bracket Z values Z I mean if we are mentioning population only so it should give the population in that sense the thing is yeah that's a very good question the thing is that if you are just using this it will return a series",
  "you are just using this it will return a series okay so this is another term another pandas term it will return a series to you okay can you see this this is just a column this won't give you the exact value this will give you the series okay so from this particular column so series are like columns okay so from this particular column we have to extract the zeroth value can you see this yes yes I can so we can we have to you know we have to to extract the values so what will values do it will",
  "extract the values so what will values do it will return you this return the values okay yeah it will it will return you this run this okay so it has returned me this now because this was the first value and then I will be extracting the zero element from it okay and uh this is how we will get the uh the exact value okay so this is how this works so I'll be using this query why not okay so so uh what I will do is now I will return it in this API and it won't be hello again it should be the name",
  "and it won't be hello again it should be the name of the city okay so this this works exactly like a python dictionary yeah it has completed it for me comment it I should just remove it okay and now now if I will try to run this all right so what's the problem okay uh it's not iterable okay me check okay okay okay got it got it actually it's returning a nump this should work does it work it's not working as intended let's check what the problem the problem is with this population uh variable it",
  "problem is with this population uh variable it was it was returning something in bracket right so probably yeah absolutely so now it's now it's good Let see okay it's NP somehow uh what we can do is convert it to a integer perhaps oh could do all right yeah it's working perfectly so we had to convert it to an integer so actually it was returning a numpy object instead of an integer so that's why we have so numpy and all these are you know more data pre-processing terms so n is an Library which",
  "pre-processing terms so n is an Library which is used for data pre-processing and other Stu but you need not worry with this okay so uh we are successfully able to do this and if I let's say if I type in Tokyo uh so it will give me the entire population of Tokyo okay so this is how your fast API will work and uh uh yeah so uh one more thing uh what I did was so I created this uh code and uh I okay let's forgot about all right okay so this is how you can create a fast API and uh you can actually",
  "you can create a fast API and uh you can actually use Python and you can you can actually use pandas to you know filter out the data because in the portion we have been given this CSV file right you can even do it for Jon and all the files uh yeah for Json as well of course we can instead of you know writing read CSV we can do read Json as well so that's another way to you know import Json files also so uh kindly let let us know that uh if you guys want a pandas exclusive tutorial or a panda",
  "guys want a pandas exclusive tutorial or a panda exclusive session uh kindly let us know uh create a discourse post or you know just let us know somehow uh you guys know your ways let us know if you want any P exclusively a pandas uh session where where we can you know explain you all the uh dynamics of pandas okay so uh this was it for fast uh API and this concludes my part of this session I uh seriously thought that it would take around 45 to 30 minutes but you know uh it took way more than",
  "30 minutes but you know uh it took way more than that so jaj please take over by the way any questions in F API yeah please ask a question uh so uh in fast API just in the question n uh we have to use class as a variable name so so how can we do that uh I just I just explained that moments ago I guess you are not present in thee okay sir so sir we can add a class as a uh population uh in class as in data query let me show you what what I did uh I just copy it okay so sorry but uh the MLT class",
  "I just copy it okay so sorry but uh the MLT class is also running in in this time period so that's I want to ask some qu queries in that class also that's why I'm switching over two classes yeah it must be hard for you I can totally understand and we were you know discussing about how you know Shifting the time of TDS sessions because it's clashing with MLT we know about that and perhaps we will find a solution for that as well so MLT is the toughest subject in diploma MLT no I won't say it's",
  "subject in diploma MLT no I won't say it's PDS at least for me yeah that's what that's what I heard that TDs is the toughest TDs is also TS I was saying TDS TDS has become that TDS has become a very tough subject because uh back in my day uh two terms back uh it was not this difficult uh they have raised the level quite a bit and I would you know I would be completely honest so back in my day it was little bit easier than it's going right now uh but you know obviously it will enhance your",
  "uh but you know obviously it will enhance your knowledge about each and every tools when I got the mail the first line was this course is really hard and I was like okay yeah yeah it was a line in my uh for for my time as well so I saw that line and because I will be honest and from a technical background I know a lot of stuff in technical so it was quite easy for me to get around TDS but I completely understand people who are not from this background from technical background they will be they",
  "from technical background they will be they have to you know AB bridge this Gap because uh in TDS we aim to you know prepare you guys for the industry we aim to prepare you guys to you know know a bunch of stuff know a bunch of tools you can use uh so yeah so actually I would like industry in like I won't I don't want to comment on that one but the thing is like it will get you custom to that but getting prepared for the industry because industry doesn't allow you to make HTTP request to other",
  "doesn't allow you to make HTTP request to other like the the data is coming from within that's that's an enclosed Department uh actually today I was planning to create a automated order processing system so what it does actually it will take uh input from uh you I mean the user in English or Hindi or some speech I mean via some uh ver verbal communication and then what it fo do it it can place orders on behalf of you and it can even update orders on behalf of you and that to using function",
  "on behalf of you and that to using function calling okay that depend like I like just I said U didn't wanted to like bring that point but it depends upon industry to Industry so that's the thing yeah absolutely because uh okay so I will comment on that a bit later first I should you know resolve sh uh doubt okay because Al because she's you know toggling from MLT to TDs so Shi uh the way you will do this is by using so you have to create an a new variable so the variable name should be you know",
  "variable so the variable name should be you know it can be anything I just put it class name okay this is the variable then you should know about this list and query and what we're doing is the only difference is that we are using an alias over here okay so what does an alias mean Alias actually means is that it's a false name okay so uh we are assigning a false name to this variable okay and we'll be using this so I just assigned this class name to this particular variable so whenever I'm",
  "name to this particular variable so whenever I'm trying to you know uh run a parameter using class I can do that easily okay so this is a false name that we assigned to it okay so this is how you are going to solve it is that clear oh yes sir thank you sir sir uh also uh my doubt is in question six also that you said that uh you can take the last of the class so can I can you take it now or uh I should wait for more time uh shti we can do one thing uh because you know that will consume a lot of",
  "uh because you know that will consume a lot of time perhaps it will consume a lot of time and a lot of people here you know they want to get through with questions you can do one thing we can arrange a special meeting with you perhaps and then we can solve that question I will also uh look into your file once okay uh you can share me that file on discourse or you know you can email me that your entire folder I will just look into it what's going wrong and then I can tell you what's uh what's",
  "wrong and then I can tell you what's uh what's the problem then we can have a meeting and I can explain you what was wrong or not okay so just mail me that folder and uh sir can you share me your email ID actually on TDS uh only cartlon and uh jat s email ID was there yeah so yeah that something we have to change as well they have to me add me as well so this is my role number uh just add it in front of just add the suffix of uh I've shared my role number in the chat you can just add the suffix",
  "number in the chat you can just add the suffix that's common for every BS student okay sir sure sir thank you sir okay all right okay so JJ canly take over uh Shan I think it will take a lot of time to do a session on function calling so how about you know uh those vectors database you know something smaller okay that we can do but that was not part of uh um today's agenda yes but we can do that we can go ahead yeah can edit the agenda later it's not like you know it's not a r in stone uh it's",
  "not like you know it's not a r in stone uh it's not like in Hindi we say so you can do that you know it will just complete one more topic while we have the time right yeah sure so kindly take over I will be you know ending to my some task okay by and and uh San hello yeah can you guys organize another session like Place another session between today and Feb 5 so that we can like discuss it for before grader assignment 3 is deadline sorry four thre's deadline yeah uh actually we are planning to",
  "deadline yeah uh actually we are planning to have a session on uh Friday and Saturday as well tomorrow and day after tomorrow that would be great Friday the session is on EX the same time 8:00 p.m. to 10: p.m. and on Saturday it's from 10 a.m. to 12: p.m. okay so it's a morning session oh God actually it's been updated in calendar as well yeah okay okay I'll have to see check it yeah okay so anyone knows what our function sorry Bally uh what I'm talking Bings hello Bings in the vector database",
  "talking Bings hello Bings in the vector database yes yes in context of vector database numerical representations of basically data in in some kind of space which may be it's having multiple Dimensions like in the case ofm there are having billions of parameters or Di and you can plot things in that space basis those parameters yeah and those are yes so you are correct wait a second I'm starting up some application okay uh so so can we create llm applications over Google collab also uh not",
  "llm applications over Google collab also uh not exactly but we can actually make uh API calls and we can get embeddings for words okay uh for example let us say we have a word and that word might be let let me call it Anand and sorry sorry for interrupting again but uh is hugging face also part of DDS course this time hugging face is I think it's been removed or something why so uh let me check if it is so basically on hugging phas what we have we have some uh models and then we have some data",
  "we have some uh models and then we have some data sets and we also have some tokenizers that we can uh make use of it uh I don't know why did they remove I think the reason behind it getting removed is because it would be too heavy for TDS I think a okay okay yeah okay that's understandable okay so let us see if this is a word and now um actually this this is written in some string format but the machine uh and and let us say I have objective let us say I have two words uh one one is this word",
  "us say I have two words uh one one is this word and then that there might be some other word it can can be cycle or something okay let's take two different two related words um bicycle and then the other word is so let me call it word one and then the other word might be word two which is basically cycle we know that these two words are very related to each other uh and let us say if I have third word apple or something so this is not much related with these two words so we can say that these",
  "with these two words so we can say that these two words bicycle and cycle they are related in some sense for example bicycle also have two wheels and they also have a steering and those properties matches so they have common properties uh but this is something that a machine needs to tell us okay so if I just give a random word to machine then it should tell me which two words are more related if I give multiple words for example if I give four or five different words so the way it cannot",
  "four or five different words so the way it cannot actually uh compare these two words right um because they are in a string format so what happens we actually store the embeddings so embeddings are basically Vector representation of a word for example if this bicycle word if you want to store it in some vector format that have just zeros ones or some some numbers okay this is how you can store and it can be of uh this Vector can be of Dimension 512 cross 1 or it can even be of size 256 cross 1",
  "512 cross 1 or it can even be of size 256 cross 1 it can be anything right so this is how you we basically uh compute we store words as an embedding so this cycle word it will also have H some embedding representation so it will also be a 51 cross 512 cross one vector and it might have one at the first place and then one at the second place and so on and the task that we are trying to do is we want to capture the similarity between these two words so the way uh to do that is we just create",
  "words so the way uh to do that is we just create compute the uh dot product so how dot product is defined um anyone one would like to answer how dot product is defined okay element wise kind of sir it's simply uh element wise product of the vectors I guess I don't exactly remember if it is W1 W2 transpose so this is basically 512 cross1 so I think this is transpose and here we have that Vector itself I think this is the correct representation so what it does actually this is first element of",
  "so what it does actually this is first element of this particular vector and this is first element of this particular word that this particular cycle so both of them it will just multiply both of them and then what it will do it will add so this is second element and this is second element so it will also multiply these two elements it will do the element wise multiplication and then it will add all of them and that is something we called do dot product sir uh yes Saki any doubt okay basically",
  "product sir uh yes Saki any doubt okay basically this is called dot product and what does this represent let us say we have this word bicycle and then we have this another word cycle so these are two related things to one another right because they have two wheels and then they also got a steering and in that sense they these two words are related if there are two words which are related with each other then this dot product would be higher basically not this dot product that is something",
  "basically not this dot product that is something called um cosine similarity so what is cosine similarity we have got this dot product right and then it will be just the division of Norm of each one of them so I will just divide with few numbers and then I will also divide it with W2 and this way we can calculate cosine similarity and this will tell us how these two words are related so if the word is bicycle and cycle and in that case this co sign similarity would be higher instead of if you",
  "sign similarity would be higher instead of if you have two words bicycle and the other word let's call it apple or something so they are not very much related with each other so if we calculate cosine similarity between these two words then it should be lesser than bicycle and cycle this is exactly how computer used to store these information so now what I will do I will just go to collab and I will first check if I have all these secrets yes so the secret is in here so this is just the open",
  "so the secret is in here so this is just the open API key that I have got from un proxy I want be logging in because then I would just reveal my secret okay so now what I will do I will import requests and then I will also what all I have to import I think this is the only one that I have to import and then now what I will do I will go to I will send a request to get the embeddings of a particular word for so for that I will need this particular URL and let me assign URL is equal to this and",
  "URL and let me assign URL is equal to this and okay this is okay um and then we also need some headers so I will just copy paste headers from some other file that I already have so in headers we are actually giving for authentication purpose we are giving away our um open key so I will just copy this particular code and then I will assign apore key to it and name of the secret would be this and I will just run this particular cell okay yeah C access so now I have assigned the token with API",
  "access so now I have assigned the token with API uncore key so now I will just create headers and in order to make a request what all we need we need headers and then we also need something in Json body so I will do that part now basically data and this J data this would actually have the uh input word for which we want to calculate the embeddings so I will just first provide the name of the model that I want to use and here what we will be using we will be using text embedding a small three",
  "we will be using text embedding a small three small model that will give us the embeddings of a particular word and I will go here and then I want emings for what would be the input word uh it will be let's first get embeddings for bicycle Cy CL okay now what I will do I will just make a request [Music] to open so URL is equal to URL headers is equal to headers and then we also need to pass another key that is Json to pass this Json data object and I will store the response in our variable or I",
  "I will store the response in our variable or I will just call it response and let's wait for it to response now I will just print the response okay the say is 200 that means there was no error while making the request and here we are getting few numbers so uh here this this is just an this is what the response that we got from openi and it have got this particular key which have a list and this list contains these numbers okay so now what I will do I will just store these embeddings we just",
  "do I will just store these embeddings we just call them embeddings in some variable so the way to get it is uh within data is it is it within data I think it is within data I want to give then yeah within data we want to get the zero index that have embeddings I guess and then that must have embedding let me just check yeah so this is embedding of basical word uh this is what I was talking about the vector uh vector or mathematical representation of a particular word and this need not to be a",
  "of a particular word and this need not to be a single word it can be uh multiple words can be the there and it can even be a whole document or sentence uh not not sentence what you call paragraph I will just I think I will assign it as an bicycle Ting e m p d d i n gs and now what I will do I will send one more request to same URL but this time I will change this bicycle to cycle let us see and let me run this let me run this and I will store it in cycle embedding and now what I want to do I",
  "it in cycle embedding and now what I want to do I now I have got these two vectors W1 and W2 now I want to calculate the dot product so for that I think I need to import numpy as NP and then is it NP do dot I'm not exactly sure about it I will pass these two parameters okay yeah so that is correct what is that this is the dot product between these two words cycle and bicycle now let me also U get the dot product between these two words actually for this particular the openi how it sends",
  "for this particular the openi how it sends embeddings I think it is normal so now if I just try to find the norm of bicycle embedding I think it would be one oh is it NP um I don't remember by nor of a vector okay this is the one that I need to use and let's just remove these things okay so it gets this basically just one if if you just approximate it it have eight or seven number of zeros so it is one and even if you look for cycle embedding uh this is also one and since there uh what we call",
  "this is also one and since there uh what we call uh Norms are one that means we don't actually have to divide it so this cosine similarity is exactly dot product so in open a whenever you request for some embeddings it will return normalized Vector so I will just assign it to cosine similarity Ry and now what I will do I will compute similarity between uh so I will first have to get embeddings for apple and now I will make a request and now I will store these embeddings in okay Apple embeding",
  "store these embeddings in okay Apple embeding maybe and now let's calculate the cosine similarity between these two words so let's calculate it between bicycle and apple embedding and oh I have overridden this particular variable actually I wanted to compare the us to so let's call this something else underscore by cycle underscore cycle this is just a be uh yes Anand wait a second I will take your doubt first let me complete it so instead of bicycle cycle it is bicycle and [Music] then is it",
  "cycle it is bicycle and [Music] then is it this is Apple okay and then this should be apple numberings did I run this I don't remember so let me run it again and I will run this again so now I will print both of them and actually instead of printing them I will just put a greater than symbol over here and then I will just check if the cosine similarity between bicycle and cycle is higher than cosine similarity between bicycle and apple and which is correct now let's actually have a look at what",
  "is correct now let's actually have a look at what are those two emings so this is the result that we got so these two words are highly related to one another bicycle and cycle and these two words are not much related to them each other so this this is V to compare two words if they are similar or two documents as well we can have one paragraph and then we can have another paragraph and then we can check if those two paragraphs are related to each other so yes Anand uh sorry because uh Mr Ras if",
  "other so yes Anand uh sorry because uh Mr Ras if you want to go forward you can I'll go after you no I no you can go I'll go after you I have actually four five outs so okay okay so um like this uh this this is this is the request we are making to and a llm yeah two llm yeah okay and this embedding thing is how to find the similarity between two words it can be two words or two paragraphs or two documents okay okay okay okay and this is how we will we will be interacting with llms uh yeah so we",
  "we will be interacting with llms uh yeah so we will be getting the embeddings from uh openi and then we will get try to compute the cosine similarity between them okay so so like embedding are are there other other like uh like like I'm talking about the purpose for example you're finding a similarity between two words are there other other other things as well like doing some other stuffs other stuff like embedding is just F like U uh the bigger purpose I think like the embedding is one of the",
  "purpose I think like the embedding is one of the purpose uh where we are finding a similarity between two words like like is it one of the task or is it the task before like the step actually this is the way to uh compare if they are I'm not aware about if there are some other way to compare two words mathematically no no no not no no no no I'm asking is this one of the task like for example one task is comparing uh two words the other task will be something else third task will be something",
  "be something else third task will be something else or this is one of the step in finding in in in reaching a bigger goal um okay okay okay I think this is one of the step that you might have to do for reaching a uh bigger goal let me just show an example that is part of project one I think activity 9 A9 or some some one of them have this thing let me just look at it um okay uh I yeah this is the one so this particular file have got list of commands uh let us it might be some okay for example",
  "uh let us it might be some okay for example we have Amazon and on that we might have a lot of products and let us say we have got one thread and let us say someone says this product is not good and then somebody else says this product is good and let us say there are four or five comments which says this product is good or for some reason let us say we want to actually calculate the similarity between those two uh comments that are there on Amazon or somewhere okay okay so so it handles like",
  "or somewhere okay okay so so it handles like this particular embeding handles uh the review the review the product review um what people like not like not only not only restricted to Amazon any of the companies who have who want to check what the customer is Shing saying about their product kind of uh not exactly this edding will just tell if two things are how similar they are with each other but company might be interested in checking the sentiment of the sentence s by sentiment I mean",
  "sentiment of the sentence s by sentiment I mean whether this this person is talking about it in a positive sense or negative sense I think we have one example of sentiment in ga3 yes the the first one so here uh what is heck programming um actually basically what we used to do in this sentiment analysis we will just give one sentence to uh LL then it it would tell us whether this the sentence is positive or negative purpose of embedding is just to get the similarity between two words this is",
  "to get the similarity between two words this is just a vector representation of words and if there are two words that are related with one other then it would tell us how correlated they okay okay okay I'll like more does it answer your question yeah yeah more things will be get cleared out when we will move forward like I'll just follow you okay okay who was the other Vias was it Vias okay does anyone have any doubt on embedding and uh the similarity between two [Music] vectors hias you can",
  "between two [Music] vectors hias you can ask your doubt now hello hello H yeah becauseas my mic was on mute so my first out is actually can we use HTTP IE for instead of requests uh for uh like making request to the URL or to the web yeah that we can do we can just change it to httpx or what was that HTTP I or X HTP GTP IE it was I think so is it yeah yeah I'm not sure about HTTP I what was it sttp I let me have a look at it yeah in the graded assignment one it was the question now that to call",
  "one it was the question now that to call uh UV HTTP then uh I think TP HTTP bin with HTTP IE then https uh then uh the whole address HTTP bin something like yeah yeah I think it was one of HTTP IE or httpx I'm not aware about so I just check once ah it's httpx okay no no the in in the in the question can you scroll down to the question see r with with HTTP okay okay I think HTTP IE is not in Python module I think it's a command line tool actually I never used it so let me just have a look at it",
  "I never used it so let me just have a look at it uh https HTTP I used Linux so like WSL okay um Al R you used it right I think I used let me see which this is assignment one now oh yeah what did I do there I think even if it does it should not matter much because this is just a different library that allows you to make requests yes no actually I wanted to ask now if HTTP also works then how can we use it to make requests uh because like most of most of the things mentioned in this uh in this",
  "most of the things mentioned in this uh in this term in this TDS course are very uh very L very latest Technologies Tech techs that are really gaining momentum as we are in the past year that have been gaining momentum like UV UV is becoming like many people are speaking about UV becoming the next package similarly htdp is a great package also people are calling I think so um okay let okay so I think this is similar so this is response get and then https okay so what we have in HTTP there are",
  "then https okay so what we have in HTTP there are multiple functions that are defined so for example right now what we are doing we are making a request using request library and we are making a post request on this particular URL and then we are also providing these headers and some data is also flowing so the same thing we can do here with HTTP we can actually import the the method that we want to use so there are uh four methods get postp put and delete and that there might be some other",
  "put and delete and that there might be some other methods as well so here what we we are doing we are using a post request and to this particular uh uh URL so let me just try if this works and I will just put it here and then what I will do I will in change the GU oh yeah I will change the url Json data I don't know how it will accept headers so I can ask GPT how do I pass headers here okay okay it already provided a code for reading headers oh let me stop generating so I will I think have",
  "oh let me stop generating so I will I think have headers keyword okay that is same as request H RS and then headers will have H RS and this I will have to first import HTTP uh from HTTP import post I guess yes and before that I will also have to install it so I will just do that so uh JRA can we just uh can we just import HTTP as something and then use that dopost doget type functions also post from htpi I think yes you can use um okay let me have a look at what is there in htpi oh what",
  "me have a look at what is there in htpi oh what happened just import htpi have that okay I think GPT is just giving us wrong information actually this is not right it's right actually in the HTTP over actual documentation also there are four five methods mentioned which is and is this correct way of importing them and using no that I'm not very sure I would have to check it again but get and put are definitely there get and pull put or pull okay can you send uh this is this is only that yeah",
  "can you send uh this is this is only that yeah documentation this is C documentation and this is called and I don't know how they are using python VI of it [Music] is it something how you install did you see if there is some some example that uses python no actually I was not able to find now so I I thought if if it is actually possible then I should ask in somewhere okay CH install HTTP home group I don't think it will make any difference I think it's a command line tool even if you install",
  "it's a command line tool even if you install using uh pip uh for example if you install UV using piip so actually UV have the way to install it using pip so this I think uh this is the way you can install UV using pip and after installing UV using pip again you you would have to ex it inst only yeah inst U and it work properly yes yes yes so actually we don't import this particular package in some U file we what we used to do we used to run commands like UV run and then name of the file so I",
  "like UV run and then name of the file so I think same way this HTTP IE is an um command line tool oh okay this is something that is there okay let me try this actually I'm not sure if this would work because this is also generated by GPT GP only so I don't trust it but now now I seriously don't because the answer generator was really genuine and now it is just completely fake so I don't think this would work and I think it doesn't even have core something like that oh but we are able to import",
  "something like that oh but we are able to import it actually see even if you install this this also at the background it uses uh this request Library only oh is it so okay yeah I can see sorry I miss it uh for now I don't actually know how we can use HTTP that there are multiple ways you can send request so the basics of sending a request to some uh URL is you Pro tell which method you're going to use and then the URL and then in headers you pass something and then the actual data that you want",
  "something and then the actual data that you want to pass yeah actually I tried I I mean the Json question I did it did it with requests only but then I was trying it with HTTP also but I could not find a way to properly call HTTP so I thought I should ask you guys uh okay you mentioned you have four or five different questions can you answer other question yeah yeah I was I wanted to shift to other question only yeah actually I don't know how to use this particular thing maybe it is possible to",
  "use this particular thing maybe it is possible to use it in Python but I don't actually know okay no problem no problem maybe request is better maybe then because if it is complicated then it's not it's not a good tool yeah yes and at the end it is also using request module only yes so my next question was uh can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them also like for bicycle can we write like b y c y c e type something um we can try yeah it would work b i c i right uh something",
  "try yeah it would work b i c i right uh something like that any wrong word but similar to Bicycle okay uh let us send a request and I will store it in so this is a bicycle so I will store it in bicycle and embedding okay yeah we have got the embeddings see emding see we can get embedding for any random word even if it is if we find like similarity between bicycle and ual word bicycles and then it would be closer to 100% like 80 90% maybe okay okay it must be I have overridden this particular",
  "okay it must be I have overridden this particular variable so I don't have so you can use it on cycle cycle Ting also yeah sure sure sure sure we can do that uh where is this is the code that I need to run and now let's run this yeah so earlier it was 48 or something now it is 47 or something no but if we if you change the name of cycle embedding in the cycle embedding you put like in the in cycle embedding we have put cycle so instead if you put a by cycle actual word by cycle and then we try",
  "a by cycle actual word by cycle and then we try to find okay let's try that and I will now store it in cycle embedding so okay let's calculate this see um that is because I think you didn't run the Json or the embedding I don't don't know if I didn't it yeah they are indeed two very much related words they are 100% related 100% related and my next question my next question was uh why are these vectors so the embedding so long so like it's just a word so why is the vector embedding so long so in",
  "word so why is the vector embedding so long so in case of paragraph it must be like thousands and thousands of variables uh no no no no no no it won't be actually so right now we are getting embeddings from open right yes we will always get embeddings in same length so even if you so this is some 15 36 numbers it is using to represent bicycle word and it word exactly what are the variables like is it coding every alphabet or is it finding its distance from all kind of words that exist in its",
  "distance from all kind of words that exist in its database or in its space uh no no no no basically this is the dimension that it uses to represent a particular word and if I believe if the dimension is high then it is better representation but then if you store so many dimensions then it will be hard to uh I mean there is some cost to it for example you need to store more numbers then you would need more storage but if the more embeddings are there then it is better so embeddings you can think",
  "then it is better so embeddings you can think of them as in some so for example we have a vector space that that is 3D instead of representing a word in 3D we are representing it in this particular Dimension 1536 Dimension yeah it's like it must involve bicycle then the shape of bicycle or yes Yes actually the these are different features of this particular features of actually yeah features so there are 15 36 features one one might represent some shape or something so there are multiple",
  "some shape or something so there are multiple features and does it involve SV SVD also like it must be doing SVD also like they must have lots of parameters and then they must be decomposing it into question uh okay yeah your voice is breaking but yeah hello basically uh becauseas I don't exactly know which algorithm they are using to Cal the [Laughter] embeddings and actually that is not yeah your voice is breaking a lot uh Rik your voice is breaking a lot we could not actually hear what you",
  "a lot we could not actually hear what you are trying to say you can use chat also and send us some links or something hello okay becauseas yeah so actually learning about the algorithm that openi is using to calculate these embeddings is not relevant for us yeah we can do a Google search open AI embedding calculation them or something data using open step by step calculating tokens J yes you can also do one thing rather than you know searching it for Google we can uh ask sure sure how also also",
  "for Google we can uh ask sure sure how also also we can ask it for completions from our python file instead of typing pick it on uh CH jbt yes completions for python file I mean I could not understand completion I meant that instead of asking it on chat gbd we can ask it through python as well oh okay J right no no through python yeah okay got it um okay not jini actually I was talking about like there is uh uh like we are using emings emings here so there is also one more thing of called",
  "here so there is also one more thing of called completions if I'm not wrong uh you can ask question you can just chat with chat gbt uh uh using that I guess API completion API assistant API and then there is a few other things in ch really complex stuff otherwise you can just simply you know search on charity that's much more easier H uh yeah actually you can take help from GPT to explain exactly how they are calculating these embeddings and um you can ask that actually what happens they have a",
  "can ask that actually what happens they have a big database for example uh so this is one particular database and what it have it have embeddings for every single possible word so it have embedding for cat and then in the next row it have embeding for dog and then in some other row it might have eming for elephant and like that it it's a massive database some millions or billions of rows are there in in this particular database and this is how I mean and then it can actually do some sech",
  "how I mean and then it can actually do some sech through this particular database for example if you want to look for uh let us say if you want you have some other word that is not part of it let us say it is kitten or something else and then you want to uh look for which so for this particular word which of them are more related so actually you can actually scan through this whole uh database and then you can figure out that kitten is the mo so cat is the most related word with get actually we",
  "cat is the most related word with get actually we also have a question related to it I think question seven or something question n question n question n no no in G also we have a question why is it this question I don't exactly remember okay not yeah project one okay yeah this is the question so here you have got three doc three different documents for example these are the uh three different documents documents you can think of them some paragraph or uh some words or something and then this",
  "or uh some words or something and then this is query parameter so now the purpose is you have to actually figure out which word is related to I mean these are three different words one could be cat one cat could be dog and then other could be elephant and then this word could be kitten or something and then you would have to figure out this query word is which of them relates more to it for example this scat is the one word that is more related to it so the way to do it is using this embeddings",
  "it so the way to do it is using this embeddings thing so you would have to figure out embedding for each one of them my last my last question was that only how can we pass like in this question in the previous in the in your example you passed one word in the Json file and then requested its embeding so can we multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately okay yeah I I think this is the way you can pass multiple words let's just check once I think this should get us two",
  "just check once I think this should get us two different vectors I will just print response. Jon okay this is very long just check the length of this response it should be two m p e DD GS yeah yeah sure sure so what I will do I will copy this system from here and then I will just paste it over here here and does it have embedding okay yeah I think this should have two elements no uh I think it this is one embedding and then I think the other embedding might have this other yeah we should change",
  "might have this other yeah we should change this yeah yeah okay so if you just look at response. Json so it's a list I think the first embedding is for bicycle and then the second embedding is for cycle so can we get the names of the word and then they're embedding separately in the Json only just a separate question like you could figure it out also maybe uh no uh it won't actually get you the name of the embeding I think it will just get you so for first so for zero index uh it will store",
  "so for first so for zero index uh it will store embeddings for bicycle and then for first index it would store embeddings for cycle actually what you can do you can pass three different uh values over here and this time you make a mistake so this is b i c and then you can calculate uh three embeddings and then this is these are three different embeddings then you can actually compute cosine similarity between them and you can verify that uh the this is the correct order so this first uh index",
  "this is the correct order so this first uh index would get for bicycle and then second index would get for cycle and then third index is for bicyc I and can we get a threedimensional oh sorry uh three cross 3 cross one 1,56 uh uh no you you won't get it directly but you can store it in whatever format you want to store you can also yeah that I don't know properly how to store how to convert a Json into an array can we do that can you please show me an example please sorry well what we can do is",
  "me an example please sorry well what we can do is uh jrj uh we can just you know uh run a for Loop and then you know extract all you can just change the uh the indexing of those and yes it in a f in a separate array yeah actually you are correct I think array and then you just pass I think here you pass bicycle embedding embedding and then you pass cycle embedding here yeah this would get us in the so I think this is two cross 1,156 yeah so this is stor those to6 yeah I'm sorry also one more",
  "is stor those to6 yeah I'm sorry also one more thing about embeddings J can you go back to that uh writer pad yeah sure yeah so the thing with embeddings is that uh let's say I am using a certain model for uh creating these embeddings so uh let's say that model actually contains uh a billion words okay so it will have a billion words inside that model and and what we are going to do is it will actually when let's say if I passed kitten just like jaaj did and if I pass kitten in that what it",
  "jaaj did and if I pass kitten in that what it will do is it will check the similarity of that word with all those 1 billion words okay so it will be like it will be going to each and every word and just then just checking uh what's the rate of similarity between this between this particular word and that word okay so that's how these models actually work and uh these models uh actually vary in the number of words they actually carry okay so a small model would have about a billion uh a",
  "so a small model would have about a billion uh a mediumsized model would have around 50 billion I guess and uh uh a large model have a like several they have several more than these these numbers can be wrong can be a bit wrong but it was like this so these are the distinctions between these models so they actually vary according to the number of words they store okay so the bigger the larger the model the better you will get the embedding so uh for instance here we have 150 uh 1,500 whatever",
  "for instance here we have 150 uh 1,500 whatever that number was so that means that it's actually checking the similarity of this of a particular word with 1,500 words in its database okay so that's how embeddings actually work and uh for for this particular uh thing to create embeddings there is a library in NLP uh actually ml there are like for instance for ML for machine learning there are certain libraries there are certain libraries for NLP as well in Python and one of them have a module",
  "as well in Python and one of them have a module called word to V okay word to V word and then then number two and then ve so I guess it was a library or module but it will actually allow you to uh create yeah word to this was so actually I think it is deployed on hugging face if I remember correctly uh I don't remember that it was of hugging face or not uh but yeah I use this module to create some embeddings and uh it required us to give which kind of model you want you want to use large model",
  "of model you want you want to use large model or small model and then we were able to create embeddings out of there so this is a library which you can explore if you are you know uh if you are interested about embeddings because that's a really interesting subject embeddings is a really interesting thing to you know explore and uh you can check this you guys for this so if you guys can uh when we get some free time after this term or in this term during this term uh can we have a session on H",
  "during this term uh can we have a session on H huging face all right uh yeah after this project after project one it would be very good I think I'm not I would say face myself but ja what do you think yes we we can have I mean I have used some models and some databases of Hing PS as well in one of my course so I can actually take a session on it but then we'll have to decide when we can take and if we will get the free time so perhaps we can have a session during the uh last weeks because uh",
  "a session during the uh last weeks because uh from what I have heard that the last weeks would be a bit lighter and perhaps if we get time we can have that question what you say yeah that would be great that would be great actually because hugging face is totally open source now so might be it will be very helpful during MLT and other stuff but let me tell you hugging face won't be of much context when it comes to TDs so if we are going to have a session it would be just for uh you know disc",
  "a session it would be just for uh you know disc for learning for learning only not learning yeah yeah okay okay we'll try to have a session but uh as of now I don't know when we can have it so that is something that but we we can have one session on yeah and one more thing was that have you guys started have you guys used deep seek as of now oh actually I tried because I okay oh if you don't have any more doubts then I can actually stop the recording and then we can talk about all that yeah no",
  "and then we can talk about all that yeah no more doubts doubts are okay okay",

  "Okay so so in today's session what I'm going to do I will creating Al so basically I we would we would be talking about the function calling part of open a and in this session what I will do I will try to automate the process of ordering something and then you can and there should be also a feature of uh updating that particular order [Music] so basically I will create a piece of program that will get prompt from user in English language and then it will uh try to understand which function",
  "then it will uh try to understand which function needs to be called and then it will actually call that particular function okay uh so I will first import requests and here we have all these so this is something that I need to copy to get access to the AI proxy token and let me change it to a proxy and let's store it in the same name and now I will just get the headers of the request so for any request we'll need headers and we also need URL to make a request so I will copy that URL here and we",
  "a request so I will copy that URL here and we have headers we have URL and now what we need we actually need a Jason body okay so so what we are trying to do actually we are trying to order some uh some thing from a online purchasing website or somewhere so let us say I provide a uh prompt and in that prompt I have a prompt something like this I want to place an order for the following items and let us say I want one laptop two smartphones and then one tablet and and let us say along with what",
  "one tablet and and let us say along with what I want I also need to pass the information about where it needs to be delivered and the date when it needs to be delivered so I will say please confirm the total price and proceed with the order and now I will put the information about delivery address and those things the delivery address is 123 okay okay can anyone just tell me a famous delivery address or some some something that we can use over here WTC huh can you repeat no no I'm telling like",
  "WTC huh can you repeat no no I'm telling like uh WTC you can write WTC World CER sure World Trade Center and we also need to provide the date [Music] so I need the order to be delivered by okay tell me the a date when you want to receive the order today today today 31st okay today or tomorrow any day uh first Feb 2025 uh so this is one such prompt that user user or rather we will call it customer might feed feed us so these are the items that he need and then where it needs to be delivered and",
  "need and then where it needs to be delivered and this also have information about on which date so now what we want we want to exact L uh from this particular prom We want to identify identify all these information in a structured format uh so that we can put them in database or we can do something with them so for that what I will do I will actually make a function call or that that is just a way to to uh get a structured output from a chat J so I will name it a function let's call order",
  "J so I will name it a function let's call order underscore function [Music] and the way to define this function is we need to provide the type and the type would be just function and then we will actually Define the function definition that will have a few details so for example name of the function would be uh let's just call order function that needs to be executed to order something and description which have three details about what this function is expected to do so what what we want want",
  "is expected to do so what what we want want this function to do actually we want to extract all these information such as how many items somebody needs for each of the individual item and then uh where it needs to be delivered and then on what date so I will just say extract uh the order details from customer prompt so is order function dependent on the the above written cell like like is there a relationship between those two on this particular cell yeah this one yeah H okay before moving",
  "cell yeah this one yeah H okay before moving forward uh function calling open AI okay so actually see uh we can send a request to openi in this particular for at so we will make a request so the name of the function is here get weather so this is to get the temperature for a given location so what will happen uh from from so when we are making a request to open AI we will'll just tell what is the weather like in Paris today so we would need the information about uh the weather of Paris okay so",
  "information about uh the weather of Paris okay so basically we are using this particular function and and the name of this function is get weather let us say this is a function that is defined in our Python program and then we want to execute this function but we don't know that this is the exact function that we need to execute because we are just getting a prompt from user so we send this request to open and then it will generate a response that have this format it will get us the name of the",
  "have this format it will get us the name of the function that needs to be executed and then these are the properties so location is one property and then location needs to be of type a string and then it's just City and country code so like what it is we have a function uh let us say it is get so was that clear Anan did you uh did you understand the uh like uh a more detailed explanation will be good like I didn't get like for example someone is asking what's the weather uh so and the above one",
  "asking what's the weather uh so and the above one was for uh for getting the information those those are the parameters which are there so when we are typing this the output is like what is the output and like what is the relation and the second thing is that the these uh these uh input parameters will be the will will remain constant so okay um if you just give me a second maybe I'll just uh just uh give me one second here sir why do you worry so much sir it's 6 Dees here sir Paris it's 14\u00b0",
  "so much sir it's 6 Dees here sir Paris it's 14\u00b0 okay no sir 6\u00b0 sir I confirm I'm in Paris now okay okay so am I audible uh yeah you are okay so effectively what happens okay when uh so the user so say for example you're using this application okay and you're ordering something from Jin okay so you go to the jbra website and there's a a new feature on there uh an AI assistant who will just take voice commands Okay and you don't even have to browse or do anything you just tell it your order in",
  "or do anything you just tell it your order in plain English or Hindi or Malayalam or any other language right and um so you give it the order which J was talking about but we'll go back to that order of scenario in just a bit because that's a little more complicated but we'll go back to that we'll first look at this weather question that he's talking about right so you ask what's the weather in Paris right what is the weather in Paris this is your pro this is your prompt and it doesn't matter",
  "pro this is your prompt and it doesn't matter how you give it to it okay and then uh your application so we'll take this prompt and it will send it to open AI okay but open AI doesn't know what to do with this you want you want to this question to be solved by your application okay so the only way you can solve this question is by extracting um what function to run in your program and what parameters to give to your function so in your program in your Python program that's running in the",
  "in your Python program that's running in the background or any other script that is running in the background you'll have a function called um get weather info or something like that and uh it takes a parameter the location and the problem is how do you get from a sentence the parameter that you need to run this function and your application could have many other functions other than get weather right so it could have another function called uh best hotels in Paris or something okay or best",
  "uh best hotels in Paris or something okay or best hotels let's just say and it also takes a location and um like this there could be many functions within your program but how does your program Python program understand this prompt it cannot right so we need open AI to tell us or tell your program what function to run okay and so what we do is we use this um feature of open AI called function calling which is a very very powerful feature okay and what it does is this function calling you have",
  "what it does is this function calling you have to give it a set of tool tools We call we call it tools because that's what they call it okay so we didn't come up with this schema it's the schema that they have come up with I'll write it over here somewhere so we call it tools and then inside tools are basically a set of predefined functions and what that does is and these pred functions will have some descriptions so that open AI knows so for example when it gets this question what is the",
  "example when it gets this question what is the weather in Paris it understands uh what's the word I'm looking for it understands context right it understands uh semantics it understands meaning uh but you want structured data out of it what is the structured data you want the function name and the argument right so that's what this tool set does this tool set says I have a some predefined functions these predefined functions and you give it its descriptions these predefined functions also have",
  "descriptions these predefined functions also have some names right and these names are for example your get weather info and uh best for Els so there will be various predefined functions and you give it the names and the descriptions of what these functions do and what their argument requirements are and uh there could be more they could be Scenic spots something like that what the arguments are for that so what happens now is open AI will take the prompt we look at the the set of functions",
  "the prompt we look at the the set of functions that are there these functions that are there and see which prompt should it which prompt uh should run what function so if it is if the customer is asking about weather information it will know contextually that it should run this function okay this particular function so if it if that's the case what open AI then will do is when you send a request to open AI which is the prompt it will give back and this is what function calling does it will give",
  "this is what function calling does it will give us back in a Json first of all the function name and it be a precise function name because we have told it what the function name is so in this case get weather info and it will also tell us what the parameters are but this also will be an adjacent format okay and it will depend completely on the definition of it that you have given over here okay whatever you have defined here that is precisely what open AI will try to do here as a response it",
  "what open AI will try to do here as a response it won't respond to the customer what it will do is it will respond to your com to your actual application itself your application takes the prompt sends it to open AI open AI responds back and tells you run this function and these are the parameters have extracted from the user prompt okay and then once you get those two things then it's trivial right then your application just basically runs this function runs this function with the required",
  "function runs this function with the required parameters and once it runs that function it will produce an output that output you will send back to your user so that's what we're doing we're leveraging open AI as a proxy for a human so instead of a an agent sitting there taking phone calls or an agent sitting in an office some where and people walk into the office and ask these questions they your customer is coming to your website asking in plain native language any language it could be but in",
  "native language any language it could be but in order for your program to execute the task which cannot understand English open AI will then par that information and tell run get weather info Run Hotel scenes or sorry best hotels run Scenic locations and then it will say use these parameters where did they get the parameters from from The Prompt that the user gave so that is what function call use and that's what we are demonstrating and it's a very very powerful feature and it makes your",
  "a very very powerful feature and it makes your programs intelligent because now it can take inputs uh without make you don't even have to make a complicated UI correct I mean think about it if you had to design this before you would design a nice website there would be all these elements in it now you wouldn't even have to do that you don't even have to look at the screen you could just speak to your computer and it'll run these functions and it'll produce an output because the the",
  "and it'll produce an output because the the non-intelligent part of it which is just Gathering the information through a locator or a Weather Service application or through any other means that's all sitting on a database somewhere right those can be extracted and done no problems but it's this interface that makes it so unique right effortless where you don't have to even look at the system and it'll get you the information so that's what this uh this concept is is that does that make it a",
  "uh this concept is is that does that make it a little bit clear for you what we trying to achieve sir so for example in this weather what are what are the parameters like we are going to example uh the parameter will only be the place right that's all you need right yes and you need the function name most importantly but your customer doesn't know the function name right he's not going to say get weather info or get cnic Hotel he won't say those things right yes and he may not even use English",
  "things right yes and he may not even use English right he may use any language that he is comfortable with so how do you account for all that variability so so basically function name is like a prompt which which opening I will take it will fesh the data it then it will produce output which which it will show to the user right yeah no open won't send the prompt won't send the response to the user your application will yeah know it will send the response to application and application will show",
  "response to application and application will show the output to the user correct your application will get needs structured information your application cannot deal with with unstructured information right yes sir so how do we get structured information someone has to translate that English into structured information what does the application need which function to run what are the parameters correct any application that you run every every program that you ever written that's what it does",
  "program that you ever written that's what it does right you're running a function and it requires some parameters right yes sir so how do you get that to happen by just speaking to it that's where the magic of open AI comes you send the prompt to open AI tell open AI hey these are the functions I can actually run tell me which function to run and what are the parameters for it and so like if the the the data that openi gives how will we convert that unstructured data into structur Data like",
  "that unstructured data into structur Data like because that's okay so that's what function calling does function calling allows open air to respond back to your application in Json itself but you can pass Json right yes sir if you if you if you tell open AI I want function name as one of and this is what J is going to demonstrate now right I want function name as one of the parameters that are coming back and uh I also want the parameters as well right I want these back in the Json response",
  "well right I want these back in the Json response okay so we to Define that in the function yes so you define that for open a and tell if the if uh the customer asks for these things these are the functions that are available to me you you tell me what function to run and so it will send your application back a Json response and your application will look at that Json response and it'll know okay I have to run this function with this parameter so that's what the workflow here is yes I okay so",
  "so that's what the workflow here is yes I okay so yeah excuse me sir yeah sir that means that contextual interpretation is done by open a correct with reference to the function calling is it yeah so this is the customer sends a request to your application okay this is just a string it's just garbage to you at the moment you send that to open Ai and open a has a list that you have given it okay a set of functions we'll call it and we tell it what the names of these functions are and what the",
  "the names of these functions are and what the parameters it has it looks at this prompt that was sent over okay it looks at this prompt and then looking at this prompt it decides what function to that is appropriate to run to solve this prompts answer okay and then you instruct open AI that you want the response back to you exactly as a Json that has what two things function name oops just excuse my bad handwriting function name and parameters that's all you want once you get that you will run",
  "all you want once you get that you will run that function and then that is what will respond to the customer now there is another option in this Loop instead of you directly responding to the customer we can also send this back to open AI to give it uh to give um what do you call for it uh an answer in semantic language so let's say for example The Prompt was spoken to the your application now you don't have some fancy uh text voice application but open AI does a fantastic job of there so what",
  "but open AI does a fantastic job of there so what you do is you tell open AI this is the weather in Paris and this is the temperature send a response back to the customer so open AI can directly send that response back to the customers so both ways it can work but we'll not talk about the complicated bit at the moment let's first understand the the the the earlier part that I was talking about this okay so one thing Caron yeah so uh on the second tab which you have made not tab this box you",
  "tab which you have made not tab this box you have made yeah after Json open AI where you have written yeah where you written The Prompt so we are telling that out of all the prompts which we have given the answers will be given according to them only I didn't quite understand the question what uh for example you are like we are basing our structure on whether the whether an end user is asking what's the temperature in like Paris or any place yes and we have defined our function there as place",
  "and we have defined our function there as place or Scenic Beauty anything which is related to Paris it could be not just Paris it could be any place right because it's fetching information from a database give me a and based on and based on that if like like I'm I'm just thinking like uh uh there is a set of Val set of uh values which we can the functions which we can Define like correct okay okay so it's it's a limited kind of thing of course your application only does certain things right",
  "your application only does certain things right it's only going it's only going to serve if it's a restaurant it's only going to serve dishes right if it's a travel agent it's only going to give you flights okay it's it depends on what your business is right okay okay got it so but what you're doing is you're making your business intelligent now you don't have to design a fancy uh complicated hard to maintain front end right it can be something as natural as speaking to a person or speaking to",
  "as natural as speaking to a person or speaking to a friend right you know you speak to someone and say Hey you know do you know any good places in Paris right so this application could be a proxy for that right it could be it receives their response it has some functions it has a database to tap into it can do all that stuff but uh the way to interact with it is you send the natural language to open AI ask open AI hey what function should I run and then you run those functions and that produces",
  "then you run those functions and that produces some output for you and then how you give the output back to the customer is up to you you can give the output via open API sorry open AI um so it is back in natural language or you may produce some other uh thing that the customer requires and incident not surprisingly this is a large part of what project also does project has the same concept of function calling built into it which is you use natural language or some uh semantic way of just",
  "natural language or some uh semantic way of just sending information that is natural and then uh you have to know what function to run by just receiving that sort of natural input that people will give it okay was that clear hello basically so we basically have like uh we Define tools or functions uh which our program has to run and users are probably going to need but they are going not going to know the functions they just going to uh say whatever they want to know and then open AI we'll send",
  "they want to know and then open AI we'll send that to open AI open a will figure out which functions to run and then tell our code that this is the answer you have to give so it will kind incorporate the response of those functions in the response to the user you got it that's 100% what this is okay I think J you can you can carry on okay so before moving to open function calling what I would do I would actually I think create a function python function that is required to place a order and the",
  "that is required to place a order and the part of which I I would create a let us say items these are the items that needs to be ordered and let us say it have a key item underscore name and that have that must be the name of the item that is laptop and then we have another item item okay not item okay qu entity so right now what I'm trying to do I'm just translating all this information into a so instead of passing it as an uh plain text English query I will first create a python function and",
  "query I will first create a python function and then we'll try to bring the llm part into it okay so this is one object actually it needs to be a list J you're missing a colon on the item name missing a colon on the item name yeah just no no just after uh item name it name I'm missing oh okay thanks and now we have another item and the second item is the smartphones and then quantity must be two and let us see for now we just have these two items and along with items what else we need we also",
  "and along with items what else we need we also Al need the delivery address so let uh small small question after one there is a comma but after two it is there is there is no comma so so is this like some something which we need to remember actually what I have defined I have just defined a list no no no after one there is a comma but after two there is no comma can just TR that like Jason so you can have the comma at the end or not it is it's it's like a dictionary so you can have the comma at",
  "like a dictionary so you can have the comma at the end or not that's up to you okay okay yeah okay so these are the parameters that are important for placing an order right and now it's in a structured format earlier it was not in a structured format so now if you want to place an order let us say we have a database now let me just Define a database _ DF and what I will do I will use pandas to store things so pd. data frame and then I will Define which all columns I need so I will need items to",
  "which all columns I need so I will need items to store the items that were requested and then I will also need delivery address to be stored in database and then I also need delivery date and along with that actually I want to track my order right so let us say in future if I want to update some details regarding order then this is the order ID that I can search for and other than this is there something else that I need and maybe customer ID and let us say also we will keep track of the total",
  "let us say also we will keep track of the total price of that particular order so we have six things that we are restoring in our database and now let's just create this database actually I'm just calling this data frame as in database and now I will Define a function what that does that will put all this information into this particular data frame right now we don't have customer ID and we also don't have order ID so customer ID I will make it as default one and Order ID we will generate it",
  "as default one and Order ID we will generate it randomly using some Library okay so I will name this function as order and Order takes three variables items then delivery address and then delivery date uh instead of delivery date we can make it delivery time in case if someone actually defines a time let us say 5 p.m. or something okay so these are the three attributes that needs to go inside here so I will just change it to delivery time and now what I want to do okay so I want to store items",
  "what I want to do okay so I want to store items which can be stored as it is in the same way it comes to us and then delivery address it can be stored by this particular parameter and delivery time also it can be stored by itself so the extra thing that we need to pass is we also need to pass the customer ID just to keep track of ordered and I will just make it default as one and so these three informations are already available to us so I will need to get this information that is order ID so",
  "need to get this information that is order ID so for that I will just use a random generator so I will use uu ID and [Music] then this stuff over here so what this would do this will just uh generate some random uh order ID uh let's just check at once so it have generated this random string now if I rerun it it will generate some other string and then if I rerun it it will generate some other string so every time it I will run it will generate a random uh eight digit string and that we will",
  "a random uh eight digit string and that we will keep it as order ID and this total price is something that we need to calculate for that what I will do I will Loop over all the items and then what I will do I will actually uh for that I also need to have price so I will have to store price somewhere and uh let us say this is the list at is stores price so we'll need price for laptop and let us say it's 1,000 and then we also need price for a smartphone and that have uh let's say 800 or",
  "a smartphone and that have uh let's say 800 or something so item of price into okay actually this is something okay uh so the way to get the name of the item is I use items item of item underscore name and now I need to get price of that item so price is equal to prices of and then name of the item okay and then I also need quantity so that will be just this thing and then total price would be uh did you import uu ID or is it like inbuild um yeah I have imported but I haven't downloaded it so I",
  "I have imported but I haven't downloaded it so I didn't run pip install but I have imported it okay available oh uh one one question uh yeah uh uh there in the price equal to price uh name yeah uh quti okay so so so quantity is fixed so but since it's a list uh and uh so how do we Define what is the like this is we are taking yeah how we are like uh taking out this uh particular the name of that thing from okay basically what we are doing this is a list so it can be iterated right and these are",
  "a list so it can be iterated right and these are the individual elements so let me just pull this code out and we'll just print what is item okay so okay got it got it got it no no I I I forgot to see that for Loop over there oh okay and then from there like I was thinking like without calling the name of that uh dictionary how are you taking out the without like along with the key how are you getting the values I forgot to see that anyways anys okay okay yeah so item item will be reiterated as",
  "okay okay yeah so item item will be reiterated as the dictionary name and then we are getting the first uh value from that key item name sir uh in the name in line which where name is written name equals to item there is written item but it should be items because the list name was items uh no actually what we are doing we are looping over this particular list and then every single item we are naming it as an item that's why we will be able to use it as item okay sir I it sorry this item can",
  "use it as item okay sir I it sorry this item can actually be replaced with an i as well so uh in Python we are used to use for I in a particular you know list so you can you know replace this with anything else as well not just an item yeah J just make your screen a little bit bigger because sometimes the detail gets lost okay uh is it big enough should I make it more bigger one or two fonts that like one or two fonts if it is possible okay now yeah no no yeah okay so now this this way we have",
  "yeah no no yeah okay so now this this way we have calculated the total price so we already had items delivery address delivery time these things we already had customer uh order ID we generated customer ID we we are setting it to one and oh sorry and then total price now we have calculated so now we are ready to actually insert it into the uh database that is this python uh data frame actually so uh instead of appending it to a DAT python um data frame I can actually what I can do I can even",
  "frame I can actually what I can do I can even create a dictionary I think so this is and now h should we create a dictionary okay let's keep python yeah I think the data frame is better because it's easier to then just see the information in a tabular format H yeah actually it is easier to see and then we can even figure out order ID and those things when we want to do search okay so now what I have to do yeah uh now I have got everything so I will create a new order that is this it will have",
  "will create a new order that is this it will have all these names all these things so items will be items and okay let me just use autocomplete so this is delivery address then this is delivery time and then order ID customer ID and then total price okay okay this should work and now what I want to do I want to access the global variable so actually this this variable we have defined in the global space but this function whenever I will run it will have its own space so I think it won't be able",
  "have its own space so I think it won't be able to access this particular variable for that I will have to uh tell application specifically that I want to access this global global variable so that I can do using Global and then order undor DF and then um order underscore DF is equal to what I want to do I just want to put this particular object into it so let let's try if this works I'm not sure I have done it using concat function and I think is it upend or underscore I think it would be",
  "is it upend or underscore I think it would be underscore aint I'm not sure let me just try appending to data yeah appending to a data frame you're appending two data frames or something um no actually what I'm doing I'm appending this particular Json object to the data frame okay I think a should work okay let's try this and we can just run this particular function and items I will pass itms and then this should be see names are same so I will just put okay I think append will work most likely",
  "put okay I think append will work most likely um okay let me have a look at this uh do okay uh it didn't append so let me try to use do append then uh no it doesn't have a upend attribute up Works only for data frame it should be concat yeah concat would be the option yeah concat Co and c I think aen was in the older version of Panda's data frame actually it's available in nay but also I think yeah also I think it was like in the replicated version of Panda's data frame it used to be there H",
  "of Panda's data frame it used to be there H there was I think underscore append or something was there earlier I but it has been deprecated yeah in I think in the newer versions it has been okay uh let's try this and let me recall this function okay this doesn't work and uh length of the value two does not match length of index I guess that we have to include some parameter which tells it that do we have to concatenate it vertically you know through columns or by rows okay that is I think XIs",
  "columns or by rows okay that is I think XIs yeah is equal to Z no not in this one we should pass this argument to the conat function itself okay this this PD to data frame that's absolutely fine yeah over here the access yeah I think this would have worked okay yes thanks sh other than other than using conat I guess there are two more functions for this Ed stack and v stack am I right J I guess these are the functions that you can actually concatenate with v stack stands for uh vertically",
  "concatenate with v stack stands for uh vertically stacking them you through rows and X stack is for I guess uh uh you know con in them vertically adding new columns right yeah adding for new columns or it was Vis Versa I don't quite remember that those are other two functions you can use okay now I'm surprised why did itth add two different things to it uh because it it iterated to two items it's item in items two items in one order idea yeah oh okay okay got it got it got it so now this we",
  "oh okay okay got it got it got it so now this we have achieved using this particular function but uh let us say we don't have this structured information and user have prompted in this particular format and this might be extracted from some speech or something so user would actually had interacted in some language human language and then this is some information that is converted from that uh Speech it is converted to these words okay so now we don't have this particular information in that",
  "we don't have this particular information in that case what we we'll have to do we'll actually have to use openi function calling that will tell us that see you need need to run this particular function and you need to run this particular function with these parameters so items should have these things so it it will just tell us these are the items that you need to use and then uh you need to use this particular delivery address so all these things it will extract from our prompt and it will",
  "it will extract from our prompt and it will extract it in the structured format this particular format so that we can run this function so that's what I will do now I have a doubt here yes so basically um like uh here you told that that structure data open will accept as PR right no no no open I would uh so basically we can feed this unstructured data to open and then it will give us this structured data in the response but in the code we are writing for specifically for this right like items",
  "for specifically for this right like items uh the structure data set yes yes yes so that's what I want to uh Auto automate it so let us say instead of ordering one particular laptop if there are two laptop then we have to change it here and actually there is no way we can uh uh retrieve this information from this particular prompt right we cannot ex manually extract this thing from this particular item I mean we can actually humans can read and then they can uh create these kind of objects but",
  "then they can uh create these kind of objects but then we might be we want to automate it we want uh llm to extract all these informations how many laptops you want to order and how many smartphones you want to order Okay so basically this is the database from which it's going to extract and we have we type the prop I uh no not it doesn't extract it from a database see what happens is normally if you wanted to place an order what do you do you click somewhere and you uh add items to a cart and",
  "somewhere and you uh add items to a cart and you do all these things right yeah so what imagine now that you have two choices okay there are two shops available two web stores available one Web Store you have to do all this process okay where you have to click and add cart and type in all these things and go through several pages and ultimately you know your order gets placed or the other option I tell you is just speak to the computer to place the order for you which one will you choose second",
  "order for you which one will you choose second second one right that's what we're showing you how to do what will happen is it'll the your application will take the user information that is passed to it and it will send this Pro prompt okay to open Ai and then open AI we'll tell open AI look our application wants you to look at this prompt and tell me what function I should run and what are the parameters for the function now typically what would happen is one of two things could could uh you",
  "happen is one of two things could could uh you know you could do this in one of two ways before before you had to have an interface developed to just do these very precise things right whereas now you don't need the interface now you open a will just pass the information for you and feed it directly back to your program and then your program will be able to execute it execute the order no no sir I got this but for example here in items uh laptop quty has been defined one but if a user wants to",
  "quty has been defined one but if a user wants to order two laptops so so then what's going to so what's going to happen yeah so open a will give us a Json back which see what items you see here right this is just an example yeah so that you know what the structure of the Json should look like okay we so what we are going to do is we're going to use this example and tell open AI I want information back that looks just like this items oh okay okay yeah so we will tell tell it we want information",
  "yeah so we will tell tell it we want information back that looks like this exactly so that's what uh what this okay answer that code like that code isic written for this items data like uh yeah AB right actually what I want llm to do right now I'm just writing these things manually right yeah but let us say these things are not here this is just to just a format in which llm should return the output back to us so I will just feed this to llm and then what it will do it will give me this list of",
  "then what it will do it will give me this list of items that have this dictionaries and all this it will fet it it will get us in this nice format so that we can execute this function to place order okay okay that's what we are going to do now so for that I will have to Define I will have to tell llm that we have a function that and the job of that function is to place some order so for that purpose we'll need to extract these important information like how many laptops someone have ordered and",
  "like how many laptops someone have ordered and then the location where it needs to be delivered so all those things I will now Define it in a Json schema so Json let me start with that so let me use um order underscore function is equal to so this would be a Json schema and its type would be since this is a function so we'll need to provide it as a function and now I will give the definition of this particular function so name of this function is order and then in description okay uh place an",
  "is order and then in description okay uh place an order customer would place an order in as a prompt and [Music] we you need to extract Json schema from that and now okay so here I have told that this is the name of the function this is exactly this particular name of the function right so to executing for executing this particular function what are the different things that we can extract from here that's what we will be mentioning right now so it will be object and then uh this is a",
  "now so it will be object and then uh this is a structured way of doing it properties and I think this must be like this and this properties so one of the properties is items right and what is items items is a array because it have multiple items so this is first item and then this is second item so I will define the definition of this particular function over here in in Json schema format okay so I will tell this is one particular parameter can you can you do a split screen so that uh functions",
  "can you do a split screen so that uh functions are sort of side by side so it's easier to follow rather than popping up and down okay okay I think I can just copy this particular line over here right because that is the [Music] important yeah yeah that will work yeah okay and now earlier we were sending this items as an array so here I will Define this particular items and the type of this particular item is array and then we need to provide the description uh list of items to be ordered yeah",
  "description uh list of items to be ordered yeah that is perfect description and this is items so now what this particular thing defines this is to define the property of individ these individuals and that is part of openi actually maybe we can use some other name for the items so maybe I will call it ordered items just to avoid confusion because this items is an reserved thing that is there for open so now I will Define each of these items so this so this is the ordered items that is a list and",
  "so this is the ordered items that is a list and within this particular this is individual item that is there so I will this must have a type of object and the parameters uh so the properties that are there are so we have two different things that needs to be passed so one is item name and type for this would be a string and then we this is name of the item and then this is quantity which is of type integer and it is quantity of an item okay that is correct so here we have defined the ordered",
  "is correct so here we have defined the ordered items is an array and within that orders item each individual ele element would have item name and then quantity so I'm just providing the definition of this particular uh parameter that is required to execute this function okay and this is ordered items where is it ending um I think here it is ending and what uh here I will have to last few more things this is where collapsable uh structures would have been good okay maybe I can make it a big a",
  "have been good okay maybe I can make it a big a little bit bigger so actually uh we want both these things right in the response p back from open so for each of them so for that I will have to provide what all things that are necessar required if these things are not present then it would just throw an error that I will just show after some time what you will show after some time J uh actually if you do if it doesn't get these things let us say if this information was not there right then it",
  "if this information was not there right then it should ideally throw an error uh so right now if I just pass here and if I say required what all things are required and here if I mention quantity and item name both are required in that case if it doesn't find uh any order right then it would thr error okay okay so kind of error handling yeah yeah okay and then additional properties we don't want anything else other than item name and quantity so the reason we put these required and additional",
  "the reason we put these required and additional properties false is because we want we don't want the open AI to hallucinate any information because that would make it useless we want the information that it's giving back to us strictly following this protocol what has been specified yeah so that's the reason we have to put these uh uh extra descriptors in the Json okay so that it doesn't hallucinate this instructs open a don't make up things just give us exactly this yeah so this additional",
  "just give us exactly this yeah so this additional property setting it to false it won't generate anything else other than quantity and item name this is just to restrict it won't generate any new keywords or something okay and so this this is the part where I have defined ordered items right this is definition for this particular uh ordered items parameter and now now we want to Define other parameters that are a delivery address and then delivery time so delivery address I have defined over",
  "time so delivery address I have defined over here which is of type a string and then address where the order needs to be delivered okay and here we are defining the delivery time that is also part of this particular function and I will put description uh time when the order needs to be delivered and now we have defined all these par parameters right we have defined ordered items we have defined delivery address and deliver every time as well and now what we need to do we also want we just want",
  "now what we need to do we also want we just want these three things back from llm so we will tell what all things are required okay think that I will have to do it um where is properties this is where the properties is so I think I will have to Define it here required and what all are required we want delivery address and then we also want delivery time and the other thing that we want is items okay and then we'll again say that uh that should not be any extra uh property so so this defines our",
  "be any extra uh property so so this defines our function uh so name of the function is order so that is the same name that is there and then we have got we have got the description of the function okay and then all these parameters are defined over here so this this items this I have already defined and all these three parameters I have defined and I am not asking it to get customer ID because that is something that we will already have so right now I have just kept it one and then order ID is",
  "now I have just kept it one and then order ID is something that we will be generating and total price is something that gets calculated from each of the item so this is exactly what we need to Define okay so now I will just could you explain once again like what have you done uh sure actually we had this function that order so whenever we will run this function we need it in the information in this particular format so all these items should be an array and then it must have so each single item",
  "array and then it must have so each single item must have item name and then quantity right yes and then these are two more par that needs to be passed through this function so that is what we are defining here so this is an Jon scha that have that is of type function can you please mute okay thanks so it's of type and the name of the function is order so that is same name so this is order okay and then this description is what this function is supposed to do so this function would actually",
  "is supposed to do so this function would actually place an order as an prompt and so this is the prompt that we will send to open and then this parameters it defines all the parameters that are here so it takes items as in parameter and then delivery address as in parameter and then delivery time as in parameter so this parameters is an object and then in that we have these properties so I ordered items So within this properties we are defining all these three uh parameters so uded items is an",
  "all these three uh parameters so uded items is an array and then this is description of that array it stores uh the list of items that are ordered and then individual item would have item name and then the quantity that is ordered and then it should not uh so llm should respond exactly these two things it should not respond anything extra that's why we have put required and then additional property so that it don't generate anything extra and then these are two more parameters that were there",
  "these are two more parameters that were there that we need to pass so this is just the definition of the same function that is there the same function the name of the function and the then what this function is supposed to do and the information about these individual parameters okay yes this format is fixed uh J this format like like we like anything we have to alter according to this format only uh yeah okay okay okay so for examples right if you go to open a documentation you can see over",
  "you go to open a documentation you can see over there they've given different examples of function calling so you can see what they have done as examples also even uh the tools in data science uh module three if you go through there's an example there as well that you can use yeah you can just go to this particular web page and there you can see some examples that are there so I have just used this particular format that is there another thing you can do as well and Anand has demonstrated this",
  "can do as well and Anand has demonstrated this sometimes when in discussions with us and on uh how to generate these things he just asks open AI only to define the Json and if it throws an error he feeds it back with the error and tells it to correct it so you don't even you may not even have to write all this out you can just explain to open AI uh um I mean to GPT what is what I meant you just send it to GPT and say look I have this function can you convert it into you know the Json structure",
  "you convert it into you know the Json structure for uh function calling and it produces something that works so that's also possible you can automate this semi-automate this creation of this Json but the reason why jaraj explained it is so that it's not so that you understand how to debug it see if GPT gives you something and then you don't know what's wrong with it at least now you know how it is defined right you understand that you have to give the function a name you have to give it some",
  "give the function a name you have to give it some description a function has to have parameters these are the uh properties that it has the properties are the uh you know various parameters that you want out of it and when you define arrays and things of that sort so at least you'll be able to understand where you might be wrong so that that's why J has explained it but the quick and easy way is to just ask GPT to generate it for you so now what I would do I I will actually send a request to",
  "I would do I I will actually send a request to open and I will just feed this information and then I will also send this Json uh SCH schema and then it should get uh in response it should have these three uh parameters in this particular format okay let's try that so I will make a request to URL that we have already defined yeah and headers also we have already defined and now I will have to Define Json it's post okay sorry and here I need I will uh give the information about which model that",
  "uh give the information about which model that needs to be used so gp4 mini and now here we'll send the messages and and this is a message that have a role of user okay I don't know what is happening so role must be user and then content so this is where that prompt would go so this prompt I have stored it in variable Q so I will now pass this prompt and now I will pass something tools and in that tools I will have to actually pass this particular function and instead of uh this function as in",
  "function and instead of uh this function as in a dictionary I will have to put it inside a array otherwise it would just throw an error and now I will set tool choice to Auto so actually if I don't set it to Auto and if I just put order over here that would also work because that is the name of the function right now let's try this out uh tle items has no attribute items okay duple items has new attribute items let me check what is wrong with this particular Json schema items have oh okay okay",
  "particular Json schema items have oh okay okay I got it actually this has to be ordered [Music] items so now let's try it again okay triple object project has no attribute oh I think this is not even sending a request it is before sending a request I think there is something wrong with it so that is headers is equal to headers then URL is URL Jason have these things oh okay it ends here and then these are not part of messages the must be outside messages is there something else that I'm doing",
  "messages is there something else that I'm doing wrong I think I need to remove this okay I think now it should work one more curly braces at the end actually last one last line uh yeah what is wrong in last line I think curly Braes should not be there before the brackets this curly brace yeah okay this should be there because of we we are this is a dictionary that we are passing as in data okay so tools and choices should be part of the whole dictionary Json file that we will be passing to the",
  "Json file that we will be passing to the [Applause] API okay let's try this sure what is wrong with it um okay I'm not exactly sure what is wrong with it I will just ask [Music] chat wrong over here what is attribute sest that the headers variable your passing to is a tuple not a dictionary as expected a tuple not a dictionary as expected okay let me check what is [Music] headers is defined as this thing I don't know what exactly is problem oh okay okay now it have made a request that extra",
  "okay okay now it have made a request that extra comma was making it a tle okay now let's just print what is there in response response. Jason hope it have got oh okay I've got some error invalid value order uh order Can it can be none or Auto or required H okay okay let's make it auto uh there there is a way to I think if you make it required and then there is a way to actually pass which function that needs to be executed so for now let's just so this is the response that we got back from GPT",
  "so this is the response that we got back from GPT and within this response if you look at this particular area so here we have the name of the function that needs to be executed it have identified that order is the function that should be executed and then these are the parameters that needs to be passed so order items is uh of this particular format and then our delivery address is in this particular format and then the delivery time it have extracted as the date followed by time so all I have",
  "as the date followed by time so all I have passed is just this prompt in plain English and it have extracted all these parameters by itself it have actually told us which function we need to execute so the name of the function is there and then these are the arguments that we need to use so now let's just just execute this function because we now have all these parameters right so now I will try to reach this argument thing so I think this must be choices and within choices it must be uh tool",
  "be choices and within choices it must be uh tool calls let's go there no no it's a array okay okay okay that is zero and then I think tool calls okay that is also wrong okay let's go back and is it tool calls let me use fun uh yeah this is the one that I will have to use and then within this I will have to use this and now I will have to use zero and now if I just want the I need function and this have the name of the function and than the arguments so now let me just get the name of the",
  "arguments so now let me just get the name of the function okay this I've got the name of the function that needs to be executed so I will just put it inside if if so if name of the function is equal to equal to order then what you do you just execute this particular function and the parameters that we need to use will uh JRA just store that in a variable name for now no because we'll anyway create a new function so it will have a choice of functions uh yeah sure okay let let me store it in the",
  "uh yeah sure okay let let me store it in the variable so let's call it function to be called okay okay sorry and now we also need the arguments that needs to be passed to the function so I will just go back over here and I think I will change it to arguments that will have arguments and from this arguments I need these three individual things right delivery address delivery time and delivery oh order items so let me just try to get order items or Dr R _ it t Ms okay must be an integer not a",
  "or Dr R _ it t Ms okay must be an integer not a string okay what is the problem with it okay I think it's a string so I will have to convert it to Json so I will have to import Json and then I will have to Json dot loads I haven't run this okay and now let me call it argument and from this I will get our cements of ordered items okay uh this is wrong again so this will have the same stuff that is there actually it have this tablet as well because in the prompt we had tablet as well okay and so",
  "in the prompt we had tablet as well okay and so let me store it in order list items let's call it and then okay these are the other stuff that I need to store so now it have got the output in the same format now we can execute the function so now let me write function to be called as equal to equal to order then what we do we actually call this function and for calling this function we need customer ID so it should be one and this items should be ordered items and then this delivery address",
  "be ordered items and then this delivery address should be delivery address and then delivery time would be delivery time and customer ID would be customer ID which is here and I can remove this okay let's execute this function I think this should append a new row to the database let's first have a look at the current state of database so it have these two orders now if I run this function it should get more orders oh what happened key there okay okay okay I got it that is because this tablet is",
  "okay okay I got it that is because this tablet is not in our database so I think we'll have to put it in the database this prices database tablet and tablet can be of 5.99 or something I think now it would work yeah it worked and now let's have a look at order score DF so it have got these three new entries and these are exact same entry that we have just executed so it have got this new order ID and then the new time basically it is just the same time so that is power of function calling we",
  "same time so that is power of function calling we can actually get the information from here and then we we have got it as in prompt and then it itself gets these things in structured format so that we can execute this particular function and then it upends it so anyone have any doubts so so like in the project that we have got uh so in that also we have to do this function calling only and automate the task yeah it will be you will have to do some task using function calling I mean here this",
  "some task using function calling I mean here this example is a little more complex but that is by Design okay we wanted to show you how to do a complex call so that uh doing Simple calls is easy actually it's very easy to make simple function calls this one is Complicated by the fact that it has an array that we wanting to get back out of the uh out of the prompt so that's why it's a bit bit more complex but if it was just simple uh properties like a string a number or something of that sort",
  "like a string a number or something of that sort then it's actually much easier to construct it doesn't take as long so so that's why we decided to show you something that is a little more complex so you can do the easier things one thing one thing uh JJ uh the LA the last three entries one two and one uh I was able to see one like till 1 and two and then after that uh you passed uh the function over there the above one okay [Music] and got this thing json. loads and okay basically uh so if I",
  "thing json. loads and okay basically uh so if I just look for the type of this particular object I think it would be a string okay this is a string because it have these endings so can you see this single quote over here which indicates that it's a string even you can type print the type of this particular object M and it would come out to be a string okay but since it's a string then we won't be able to fetch these individual parameters right because it have to be a Json okay in order to",
  "because it have to be a Json okay in order to convert it to Json we'll use json. loads which converts any any string to adjon okay and then that uh we are passing that as an argument for ordered items function which you have explained done and from there onwards ordered this ordered items equal to arguments and uh inverted commas ordered items there uh code cell 67 okay uh so see we have this particular thing right M and then we we have just loaded it as in Json so I will just show what this",
  "it as in Json so I will just show what this have got so this have these things right so we can so this is a dictionary kind of thing so we can extract whatever is the value of this particular key so that we can do using arguments and then the name of the key it is same as extracting from a dictionary okay okay okay okay okay G what you can do is change the prompt so you can show what dynamically can deal with various types of prompts as well okay uh Calton I will need uh two minutes okay I'll",
  "uh Calton I will need uh two minutes okay I'll back in two minutes okay sure yes could you share the link of this notebook um we'll uh we'll discuss and see okay uh normally we don't share notebooks mainly because the resources that you have should be sufficient um because the same thing will happen with like project as well we'll actually build a working prototype of the project but then uh you know students will just copy paste whatever theyve got on there right the you will not uh really be",
  "got on there right the you will not uh really be able to get to grips with it unless you try it out yourself so that's why we usually typically in every term in TDS we have not provided these these particular notebooks the that you're working in session we to remember them as well cart cartton if uh like till the time he comes back there were two three new entries so where we have put put those entries uh so that we are able like so that we are seeing those in the data frame like so those are",
  "seeing those in the data frame like so those are the new ones that uh came because of the response that came from the prompt right the first two initially were when we just used our static uh object to put it into the data frame the rest three came after we send the prompt and got a prompt back okay so I'm under like I'm under the impression that we are abending that to the data frame which is there yes so so so so those three are the new things correct or okay they have been ordered to the",
  "correct or okay they have been ordered to the they have been added to the audit table yes saki you raised your hand yes sir sir actually I want to ask where did you get this URL and uh where do we used this URL and how Okay the URL is uh from uh so if you go in week module week three um I can yes sir quickly [Music] share so if you go to week three this very first page as soon as you hit large language model you see this over here use AI proxy uh we have explained this in a previous session as",
  "we have explained this in a previous session as well I think it was Tuesday's session and over there it takes you to this page and uh these URLs are from here because you have to use an AI proxy in order to use your open API key that an has provided so if you look over here these are the end points for this proxy we have explained what a proxy is and why you need to use it uh on in Tuesday's session so this is where they are from so this is the one that we using at the moment this post um uh",
  "one that we using at the moment this post um uh request and uh then the key itself you can get from this link over here and then you will be once you sign in over here you'll be able to get your own API key so you can then run these requests to the open a okay sir thank you sir yes because hello yeah yeah hello am I audible uh yeah it's a bit soft but you can with you're audible yeah so actually my doubts were related to the collab notebook only uh I was conf I was not I couldn't understand The",
  "uh I was conf I was not I couldn't understand The UU ID instance like uh is uu ID instance specific like when we run the program so it will create a unique ID but the next instance when we run it uh it will it could create the same ID again like there are chances is are there chances like that so it depends on how you so uuid generally is supposed to give you unique outcomes each and every time but uh it depends on how long you want The UU ID to be so if The UU ID if you if you're very",
  "UU ID to be so if The UU ID if you if you're very particular about not having any clashes and you know the range of the requests that you're going to get so if you know that your requests are only going to be in the range of tens of thousands then depending on that you can increase the size of The UU or decrease the size of V ID so if you increase the size the possible of what you call a collisions uh is very very very low so that's so it is available in the uid documentation how to increase",
  "in the uid documentation how to increase the size and reduce yeah yeah if you look it up it is all available there but that's typically what's used to create unique entries so can we integrate it with a voice model also like where the customer can directly interact and with the model and uh it will and decode the speech to text speech to it would do speech to text and then all this stuff definitely you have to um so speech to text is possible that's not a problem the only difference will be",
  "that's not a problem the only difference will be what how you structure your request to the open AI okay okay so there there prompt engineering would be would come into effect like a devopment there's no prompt engineering involved here really I mean it's we have to instructed open AI uh exactly what we want so in that sense there is no prompt engineering involved here at all the person inter the customer interacts naturally with the with the application the application then sends the request",
  "the application then sends the request to open Ai and then open AI gives us structured information back from the unstructured information that was sent to it and and then we are able to act on structured information because all programs work on structured information okay so if if the customer does not sorry yeah so if the customer does not provide complete information then the then the model will again Ask the customer provide the relevant information design depends on how you implement your",
  "design depends on how you implement your uh stack right so if your application stack uh is is designed to handle request complete request yeah uh I think open I would itself ask for the information got it have got these required parameters so let's if I just remove this I think it would ask to send uh delivery time over here MH yeah let me just try it out yeah your screen you'll have to start sharing again oh is it sorry sorry sorry no no it's because uh I had to show something so that's why",
  "because uh I had to show something so that's why okay uh so is my screen visible okay fine sorry I I'm intervening yeah uh so uh Vias so what I have done earlier this was the prompt right uh from this particular prompt I have just removed the date part of it okay and now I will make the request again this request doesn't have date but we are telling uh openi that we also need the date and it is a required field right so it must get this date but we are not sending date so in that case what",
  "but we are not sending date so in that case what would happen let us see response. Json okay okay I think it would ask for date no it didn't ask for the date oh okay uh as F that is really good okay uh let me let me put something over here um assume that if no data is there just do it so okay I think I will change the prompt and I will say if nothing is available then you need to get some error yeah but I think you don't I think you should do that in the messages part not in the function itself",
  "in the messages part not in the function itself okay okay yeah correct that is system prompt right yeah system prompt that's where you specify very clearly to it you have to give it yeah you have to put role system and then specify exactly what you what is required and what you do not want it to do and all that St so okay uh okay um I think if there is no date then please ask to provide date is this correct or if there is no if any parameter is missing then that param missing any parameter is",
  "missing then that param missing any parameter is missing then Al J I think you have to give the system a clear explanation of what its role is first and then you are in agent that takes orders takes orders okay and if any parameter are missing then uh request for that parameter is this enough uh this will be a bit more of trial and error until we get it right okay okay now let's check yes it have asked for the that you need to provide the delivery time and now if I just put time back uh so this",
  "time and now if I just put time back uh so this is where we had time and now if I put time back I think it won't throw any error let's try it again okay where is the part where I was making request here also I think to make the prompt robust you should write that do not uh you know I forget what it was but I've seen it in the video where Anan says you should not hallucinate or something like that it tells don't deviate or something like that okay see uh yeah Calton what you are saying is",
  "okay see uh yeah Calton what you are saying is correct now it have started generating something else uh I I can finalize your order and these things so I think we need to should so one tablet which is mentioned over there like uh if you'll go up in the prompt like is it like have you specified that yeah okay okay okay okay okay now it is clear I was still thinking that we have only put laptop and smartphones now where this tablet is coming from yeah okay okay it is part of okay no no I like",
  "yeah okay okay it is part of okay no no I like since it was from the right hand side I like I was I was wondering like when we are giving two only how come three is coming okay if all parameters are present then just respond with Jason I think this should work now it should not generate something like this can I finalize or all these things it's taking a lot of time to run this qu okay finally yeah now it have worked hooray great so yeah so this now is a much more robust uh call that is being",
  "now is a much more robust uh call that is being made so you given the system of specific role and then the function calling works as intended and uh my other other doubt was uh how how can we package like we are doing it on a collab notebook so can we package it into a full FedEd application like how to make I know we can package it but how to package it into a full full-fledged application uh yeah that's something we will demonstrate as well cuz what we're going to do is we're going to make",
  "cuz what we're going to do is we're going to make one more function so that you can see it won't it's not just for one function okay it will have to choose from a menu or function so we'll just create one extra function a simple one and then uh once that is done we will put it all together and actually make it into a Docker uh image push it to Docker and then we will run the application just as intended oh great oh great wow okay uh so suggestions which function should we create now we have a",
  "which function should we create now we have a function to order so what other thing that you want to uh automate like modification of order or placing a return request something like that uh sure so let's go with the order modification then yeah that would be great sure okay okay so for that what I will have to do I will have to write a function first um okay let's first write the python function similar to this particular function uh G uh okay yes vikos Jr sorry Jr there is one more doubt",
  "yes vikos Jr sorry Jr there is one more doubt before you proceed further I would like to ask yeah you you you coll you imported user data from Google collab I guess yeah yeah so can you explain it a little bit further I I couldn't get it okay so what I doing over here so this is something so what this is so if I go to oh actually you asked for speech to text right so here I just searched for speech to text converter model and then on hugging face this is a model that is there and it actually",
  "this is a model that is there and it actually uses a pre-trained model from Facebook and it have some processor that are from Facebook and then this is something that you can use I mean I haven't tried I just searched so you you would have to try it out yeah yeah also open a has its whisper model so if you're using tokens you can use the whisper model you can send uh audio to the whisper model of open a yes yeah wh I wh okay so this is the one so all that I think all this description would be",
  "so all that I think all this description would be here uh can we use culton can we use it in function I mean API through API yeah yeah through API you can use okay okay okay okay so this is something that can be used uh now what I will do uh I have forgot what I was going to do okay so if I just go to AI proxy Doon so if I login over here what it will give us it will give the uh AI token that I can use to make request to un proxy right so that particular uh token I'm storing over here and then",
  "uh token I'm storing over here and then I'm naming that token as e AI proxy uncore token and this is kept as in secret so only I will have visibility to view it if I just click on this button then only I will be able to view it so before uh sharing my screen I have pasted this token here and I have named this particular token as AI proxy token and then I have kept it as in secret so benefit of this this thing is let us say if I share this particular notebook with you then you won't have",
  "particular notebook with you then you won't have visibility to this token yeah proxy token okay okay yeah just like G ignore or some some sort of like that it's more like an environment variable it's stored in the environment and then to get access to it from the environment he uses the google. collab import user data okay okay so now let's create one more function uh let's first Define the pythonic way of it one more thing because that um that import from um collab that's only for this collab",
  "import from um collab that's only for this collab notebook okay that's not for if you're doing it in vs code you would not use this at all or if you are using it as a packaged application inside the docker you know where you're going just going to run it as a python script you won't you won't use this this is only because this is an environment variable stored in Google col yeah that like it's it's totally collab specific like for in case of vs code I think we'll use git ignore or some sort of",
  "code I think we'll use git ignore or some sort of folder that cannot be accessed if we when we share our application packages yeah it won't be G ignore it will be EnV something like that it would be okay EnV would also work okay yeah because git ignore is basically a file that tells get not to not to track these files it's a list that it tells not to try so in G ignore you would store the names of files that you don't want uploaded to GitHub so you'll definitely have put EnV and all those yeah",
  "you'll definitely have put EnV and all those yeah get correct correct okay okay fine got it okay let's let's write the other function that is to update a order so let me Define a function let's call it update _ order and now it needs to update order that means I need to get the information about that order so let's call it order ID that I can use to actually get the information about which order needs to be updated and now what all I need for updating your order I also need the updated items",
  "updating your order I also need the updated items let us see someone have updated the items of the order and then I would need the delivery time someone can update delivery time yes and okay they can even update at uh yeah they can even update address so now over here what I'm doing I have just got the access to the global variable order _ DF and now what I want to do I will I want to filter out all those uh Ord whose ID matches with this particular ID so let me use that order DF do L and then",
  "ID so let me use that order DF do L and then order DF of I think I think that suggestion was correct what these suggestions will just keep getting better uh yeah this is getting better because it have information about all these cells right so it is taking all it is making use of all these upper cells to actually generate this particular cell so it even knows which all variables I'm using so the context is improving yes I'm just uh making sure that this is correct function let me just print it",
  "this is correct function let me just print it out I don't know why it have got this items over here it will get you only the column titled items okay so if you need to have all the columns you have to remove that okay okay okay it will get only items okay then let us remove that oh I got it how this DF dolog Works actually over here we provide the row index and then we put a Col comma and then we provide some condition on column right yeah correct correct okay so this is filtered underscore",
  "correct okay so this is filtered underscore maybe this order okay for now I think I will do this much I'm not sure if this is correct okay this must be correct okay let's just print it J are you trying to filter on order ID is it yeah yeah I'm trying to filter on you don't need the lock I don't need the lock no okay okay think this would work yes okay along with order ID can I also put one more constraint for customer ID actually I want to put a constra for customer ID as well I think oh okay",
  "a constra for customer ID as well I think oh okay it have I think this is correct way it's been a long time let me check if this works oh okay this is wrong JJ are you trying to uh no it was single single and no you have to put a ENT something ENT uh this one yes yes just a single one okay uh okay let me execute this and work uh even writing a and and work and worked right okay okay let's see use and then and now I will just call this function and uh it should have this as an okay let me just",
  "and uh it should have this as an okay let me just copy paste the order ID this one and then customer ID must be one and these things I think I will need to pass n o n e [Music] okay defa okay actually you have to you know uh put these whenever you are putting these none equal to for default values you have to put them at the back the very back so put customer ID before all these okay thanks I got it I think I will have to put it there right yeah precedence of uh parameters that you have to",
  "yeah precedence of uh parameters that you have to follow what is theor truth value is ambiguous [Music] okay truth value is ambigous use do all okay I don't know anything about this error so I will ask GPT what is wrong over here and I will feed this error on the error you are ening because you are using end operator which cannot be used in p with Pand so I guess you have to use % that's the difference this is oh yeah now it worked also rather than printing it we can simply return it in the",
  "than printing it we can simply return it in the function right yes now it must be a data frame I think yes you know even I forgot that why and wasn't working and I'm person should that's the reason okay and okay and now what should be the logic of update order function because we have got multiple order you would use The UU ID right what you want to specifically update no no uu ID it's on the same right right yeah yeah yeah yeah you'd have to do a search on the product itself that needs to be",
  "a search on the product itself that needs to be updated on this item right and if it's an address for that order then all three so it's actually a little more complex in logic wise than you would expect uh ja can you can you just tell me what are you trying to achieve maybe I will be able to help you actually now I I not able to think of the logic to for for this update order function actually how exactly I will update quantity of this laptop and these things I think I should have stored them",
  "these things I think I should have stored them in different colums you know we can uh uh we can update these values Lo using lock uh before that we'll have to actually see uh this updated items it will have let us say I just want to update the price quantity for laptop right MH in that case what we will have we will just have laptop so I first have to search that it's a laptop so over here I just want to search this First Column if this updated items have name as in laptop right so I want to",
  "items have name as in laptop right so I want to just select this one and then I want to update this quantity over here okay let's do one thing this is this one is uh mostly a logic exercise right but it's not serving the purpose of teaching function calling so what we'll do is instead of update order we'll do just a delete order for today so at least we can demonstrate two separate function calls a delete order should be straightforward oh that is correct let me just remove this no no I don't",
  "is correct let me just remove this no no I don't have to remove it I can just this this we can keep it for some other time just uh will okay okay okay sure sure simple order for now so Define delete underscore order and should it be delete order or cancel order doesn't matter okay order ID and customer ID okay and then uh I think this would work I I think yes so we would just have to delete those specific rules we have to obtain the indexes and [Music] then once we obtain the index we delete",
  "[Music] then once we obtain the index we delete those rules and return uh what should I return return a message but otherwise not is required but maybe a message that the order has been cancelled and okay so now I will have to define the definition of this particular function over here right and earlier I was calling it order function but now it have got multiple functions so I will just call it functions and I will pass this over here okay and now I will Define the other function or here only",
  "now I will Define the other function or here only and this must be a type type function and then function name should be delete order and I think this must also end here and now what are the other things that we need to Define we need to define the description customer would delete an order as a prompt and you need to extract the Json screa from that um actually while deleting something we don't uh need to extract anything because we are just using order ID and customer ID yeah but we still",
  "using order ID and customer ID yeah but we still need to get the function name itself yes it's more like if the customer say please just cancel my last order you so you delete the order yeah so what should be the description then customer would like to cancel the order I think this much is enough right yeah this parameter we don't need to pass anything right so I will just miss this part is not required till here and yeah that's it I think this no no you need you need the order ID as well yeah",
  "no no you need you need the order ID as well yeah because order ID yes yes yes correct so I will need to have prop parameters and this parameter should be of type object and then it must be um properties okay and this can be deleted this must be integer I think is it in or ineg R I think it is the whole word integer yeah yeah and I'm forgetting some thing over here so this is correct requ parameter and then uh yeah this is also over here and yeah I also need to pass required that will go after",
  "I also need to pass required that will go after parameter definition and this is rqi ready okay yeah and this looks a bit messy so I will just keep it here this correct position and I think this can be deleted yeah okay and let's just uh let's execute this additional you need additional addition yes okay so now in prompt I will have to tell which order it needs to cancel right so I will get the order ID so let's get the order ID from here and um okay just remove these four lines I want just uh",
  "okay just remove these four lines I want just uh just make a new prompt variable oh yes correct correct correct Q is equal to I want to cancel my order for order ID this and now let's execute and I have already done that so right over here we have two different functions order and then the second function is delete order so these are two different functions so now I will pass both of these functions to llm and what llm would do it will actually understand which function needs to be executed by",
  "understand which function needs to be executed by this prompt only so here we are telling that it needs to cancel this particular order so for cancelling it would need to say that this is the function that you want to execute and this is the parameter that you want to use okay so let's see if it gets that I hope that yeah it have oh order ID is zero why oh okay I got it that is because our order ID is not an uh in but we have defined it as an integer in the ID has to be like a string yeah yeah",
  "in the ID has to be like a string yeah yeah so now let's rerun but I hope you've noticed something even though it didn't get the order ID right that time I hope you've noticed something very powerful that has just happened there was a choice of functions and just by looking at the prompt the open AI was able to decide which functions to actually run and it gives you your application back that result so if you had 100 different functions that your application does just by speaking to the",
  "your application does just by speaking to the application or giving it natural language it's able to choose the appropriate function to run so I hope you recognize the immense power that is there behind this but uh sir the there are chances of it hallucinating also like choosing the wrong function also that uh depends on how well you have structured your functions yeah your functions should be robust and obviously testing has to be done but um that's where the way you handle errors and deal",
  "that's where the way you handle errors and deal with that that looping how you deal with that looping uh will make it more robust and in Project we will actually show you how to create these feedback loops as they are and this is why this is why people need prompt Engineers yeah yeah I mean it's not such a significant thing the main thing is you have to understand the mechanism and uh apart from prompt engineering we actually will show you how to create a complete Loop where if something",
  "how to create a complete Loop where if something doesn't work out as planned how it can recover gracefully from it and actually continue and uh correct itself so that also is possible to do and we'll be able to demonstrate that project so basically prompt engineering is a science in it in itself is it some sort of like that uh it's I wouldn't call it a science it's more like an understanding how the system works uh and when you have an understanding of how the system works then you're able to",
  "of how the system works then you're able to write better prompts that give you the expected results see in in week three module see most of you have been focused on G right but really what you should do is go through the week three module content there is some very very good material in there which will show you exactly these aspects of it so it'll talk there is a specific video on prompt engineering there's a specific uh video on um uh context and all these sorts of things that uh involve",
  "and all these sorts of things that uh involve using llms so I strongly recommend you go through them because the more you understand this system the better you'll be at engineering and you can engineer them to be very very robust so the course content is heavily loaded with information I can see that lots of information it's like one week is not enough for covering one week okay yeah yeah I appreciate that it is a bit heavy but um nevertheless um it is available so I mean spacing is something",
  "um it is available so I mean spacing is something we'll have to like think about as we develop the course because this course constantly is evolving each each term it is changing you see so I agree that we have gone a bit heavy this time in content in the first few weeks so we might have to change the pacing of it slightly for next no but sir it it's healthy I think first 3 weeks and we are done with generative AI then we can just work on building database and other stuff other yeah yeah I mean",
  "database and other stuff other yeah yeah I mean that was the goal anyway the goal was to get you to the stage quickly so then you can build the whole Pipeline and uh understand the how it all works together so that's you're right about yeah so now let's let let's okay let's do this I think this would get what is required I think this order ID is something that needs to be fetched from the uh yeah yeah this needs to be fetched and customer ID is always one I think this would work let's try this",
  "always one I think this would work let's try this out okay what happened expected semicolon semicolon is here L if oh that is L if not L if uh now it should have deleted that particular entry and what was the order ID that we passed we passed ft okay FD um where is that so this these two entries should get deleted they did not delete okay uh did you pass the um the function to function to be called you might not have done that oh okay okay yeah got it I okay I think I haven't done that and then",
  "it I okay I think I haven't done that and then arguments also I need to do and now I think this should work yes okay I think it's a bit late to do uh do the API endpoint and the docker image so we'll save that for next session I think uh yeah maybe we can ask students to do it first and then in the next session we can do yeah yeah that sounds great okay guys um that's it from us today um if you have any more doubts or anything um can ask now or we'll end this session for today okay thank you",
  "we'll end this session for today okay thank you very much and have a good night we'll have this session on on the playlist for tomorrow morning thank you sir thank you very much thank you for your time thank you J thank you for very good session interesting session thank you thank you sir the session was very helpful by the way does anyone have any doubts related to ga2 or ga3 then we can take those doubts uh can I stop recording culton uh just keep the recording on for the doubts and then you",
  "keep the recording on for the doubts and then you can stop after you've taken the doubts just in case someone has you know something that they want to refer to okay I'll be leaving the call okay okay okay good night everyone thank you is there yeah good night good night sir good night is there a session tomorrow yeah there will be a session tomorrow calar is it it's not it's present in the calendar it's uh it's on uh at 10 a.m. okay it's in the morning. to 12 the evening it not okay in the",
  "the morning. to 12 the evening it not okay in the morning yes yes sh yes my doubt was uh discussed earlier but uh I haven't got the solution as San also said that doubt will take lot of time but would you like the doubt uh well the thing is uh let me share my screen once okay the thing is that even I am struggling to you know debug the error you can see that I was just working with this file okay so the problem uh I guess the problem lies with this code okay so it's not able to identify so I",
  "this code okay so it's not able to identify so I changed the code as well so I was working with j and figuring out what stuff has gone wrong but uh apparently it's not working as intended and uh uh the code that you shared me wasn't working as well and this code which chgb gave me isn't working as well so uh I will just show you the application once saki have you posted the code on discourse no sir actually I don't I didn't post the code on the discour but I have raised the problem that I have",
  "discour but I have raised the problem that I have uh facing some problem in this uh versal question and as well as in the uh uh nth question that was uh the only thing I'm struggling in the ninth question with is uh how to make class as a variable name I've posted question on the discourse so uh that thing uh you have you posted that on discourse yes sir I've posted uh a problem with question number six and question number nine both on the same uh post and uh you have tagged me because only",
  "uh post and uh you have tagged me because only then I will perhaps no sir I I didn't Tagg you but I will raise again the question and tagged you in a uh yes today so the only thing the uh thing with the ninth question is that I actually discuss discussed it in the last session so either you can you know just check the recording once I guess it would be I actually uh create that alas equals to class but uh I didn't get that uh if uh in the starting do we uh do I have to uh write class name as",
  "do we uh do I have to uh write class name as class or class name as it is actually I didn't get that that's why class name as class uh you're talking about the variable right yes sir the variable can be anything you can write it class name or anything you can you know so it will it will act as so if we if we Define alas as is equals to class then it will act as a class variable it will actually act as an alias okay so let's say this is my uh so this is something okay this is my code then uh API",
  "is something okay this is my code then uh API so this my end point for the API now when uh in our code it the variable has been defined as class name okay so if you don't use an alias then you have to give this particular parameter name as class name but when you're using the Alias you have to you uh you can use that Alias for for calling out this parameter okay so you can use this class name using an alias okay I've done this but but when I uh run this uh URL uh it will uh uh it was giving me",
  "run this uh URL uh it will uh uh it was giving me the wrong answer and when I put class underscore uh class and underscore which was the name of the variable then then only it giving me the correct answer uh it was it was not working as class that's why screen once actually sir I uh I'm right now I'm not at home I'm somewhere else I I don't uh join the meeting with my laptop I on my tab all right all right that's not a problem we can do one thing you can uh when you are raising again that",
  "thing you can uh when you are raising again that discourse post you can just paste that screenshot of your code once okay then I will be able to debug don't don't P screenshot of the code I put the code in uh um the block code block on discourse other then it's difficult for us to pass it yeah then we'll be able to copy it yeah I mean we have solved this actually we someone else had the same same doubt isn't it J I think very early on uh in this course someone had raised this very same question",
  "course someone had raised this very same question and they ran into the same problem they using class underscore there is actually a way to fix that issue which is um I don't remember the where we have stored the code but there is we have solved this it is not that it's not not Sol but it has to do with that parameter name itself actually even I Sol this particular thing so there is this is the you know class name so this is the particular code which I used and I was able to get through with it",
  "I used and I was able to get through with it yeah yeah I think this is correct syntax yeah correct sytax so this is the variable name this is the class name variable that you're going to use instead of class okay and then you have to give the alias so just check it once that are you following this exact same syntax or not because the only way that you are able to access this it's only working with those underscore class then there should be some error in this okay okay sir I will I will check",
  "error in this okay okay sir I will I will check uh first and then take a screenshot once just take a screenshot from your mobile and just's check it once okay if the problem still persists then you can you know raise it in the discourse yes sir I will raise it on discuss if I if I face some problem yeah okay so now talking about your another question uh this one the problem which I'm facing is that here it is the problem is that uh the page is opening because when I was working with it earlier",
  "because when I was working with it earlier using the code that you gave me the page was not working it was just whenever I opened it it was downloading the entire code file okay so what I did was I made few changes which was the name of this particular ver. Json was actually uh it was r s SE so ver was not actually able to identify your bid instructions okay so it was something like this it was this so that's versal was not able to identify uh that you have some build instructions given to it",
  "that you have some build instructions given to it okay so I just renamed it once and uh yeah so this is one thing that you need to change that you need to check uh another thing is that that uh so now it's working like if I go to the API endpoint it's still showing me this server crash error okay I even try to you know debug it using console and networks but nothing is working at the moment uh no I mean San for that you can just go to the versel logs and see I check that as well but uh let me",
  "logs and see I check that as well but uh let me just show you so this is giving me this so it's not even able to fet the fa icon and uh I just opened it and it's giving me something like uh it has change now search file directory okay so it was giving me something like so it's not able to fetch that file that file is not yeah earlier it was giving me some another error it was giving me some you know uh HTML base HTML kind of there is a problem with the that Library something like that but uh",
  "with the that Library something like that but uh now it has but yeah now it is it can't find the Json file yeah I'll debug it uh uh more thoroughly okay and uh I won't be available tomorrow uh tomorrow morning from 8: to 2: so I will debug this and I will get back to you by tomorrow evening okay okay sir uh Shan instead of using this os. paath if you just use the relative path with that particular file I think that might work just try it once yeah so uh don't use yeah don't use the file should",
  "so uh don't use yeah don't use the file should be in API folder or in the versal python API folder it is in just copy the relative path of the file yeah I think this is correct is it okay yeah once I'll run versal prod actually this is the code which chat GPT gave me and I also tried other things as well but again it was not working let's try this hopefully it works okay so uh let's check this once again let's check this once again okay so it's giving me this error just a second just a is the",
  "giving me this error just a second just a is the URL correct on top oh yeah I'm back is the URL correct uh the URL yeah I just check it once it should be present right here inspect it open me that error API let's try putting some no no there there's a it's not fetching anything right so you have to check the log and see what the actual error is no search file directory okay so it's not able to find it the thing is that uh uh versal is actually accessing this API folder and it's taking uh it's",
  "accessing this API folder and it's taking uh it's going to you know put everything in context related to this API folder so that's why we have to why don't yeah just stick it in directly yeah just once again building okay let's open it once [Music] again and uh all right again it's showing that that same eror go to API again so again I will go to the logs let's check it once I guess this time I'll will find that error which I was talking about oh yeah okay okay okay so missing variable Handler",
  "yeah okay okay okay so missing variable Handler or app in file okay so this is something Rel to the code index okay Handler okay it's oh app in file this this is missing variable okay yeah so like it's a bunch of there are a butload of Errors that's prompting up over here sh yeah can can you go back to code yeah just scroll slowly okay [Music] um we even performing course so let's give that I did not do it this much complex so what I have done I have created a class Handler and that is uh what",
  "have created a class Handler and that is uh what we call extending B base HTTP request Handler and then within that I have get function and post fun uh only get function yeah I did this this is the yeah code and which had the actual error I just past it once save let's run this it's done it right let's try it once again okay it is not giving that server crash error let's try running some parameters and I copy it from here let's see is it name or class no it's it's name over here so the class",
  "or class no it's it's name over here so the class one is in the nth question okay okay so it's giving us null so okay I guess uh this code is working now some that's the error which I have got that it's going in the response that's the error and that's something related to the logic that you using right over here that we have to check so I guess that while I was debugging this I Chang few things and then I you know pasted the code from chat gbt and then I didn't try this that particular thing",
  "and then I didn't try this that particular thing with this code so uh I think the problem is with parsing the parameters maybe try printing query params and these things what I will do is I will run it on local machine first and then again and again yeah because we know that it is runs on the server now so it's okay you can just yeah try it on the local Ma installing okay response data when okay okay okay okay okay associated with the value okay let's try running this once then we check okay",
  "let's try running this once then we check okay it's giving us null and the okay it's able to fetch this it's able to fetch the query parameter out of that and uh also it's able to get the name and then okay so that's a default value right there okay let's do one thing I will do it again because that's a dictionary so it should work like this as well a name okay so that's uh okay that's a list if I pass let's just try this one for name in query parameter and name so I will do this like this now",
  "and name so I will do this like this now okay response and data response data marks okay so we have this all right other otherwise we can just simply make a list as well all right that's will make it much more easier rather than this uh okay so inside this marks we are going to Abend this exact same thing and it's going to be giving us none and uh what is this Marx data okay so this is the marks data if name in marks sta so this marks data some yeah okay so this is right over here all right so",
  "yeah okay so this is right over here all right so we are passing through the entire Json object and then we are okay okay wait a second uh how are we trying to search for this name can you show the structure of Json okay uh how it is searching for this particular name we are looping through this entire list yeah but uh I didn't understand this appending part marks data of okay so we are trying to find it so we have to run a double for Loop for Loop yeah absolutely this okay Mark in name is",
  "Loop yeah absolutely this okay Mark in name is equal to all right all right and then it will break no we don't want it to break oh yeah we can break it absolutely you don't need this one and then it should send the response and right here we'll create a new one and then it should be uh what's the syntax that we need uh can can you tell me the syntax that we just okay let me open ga3 yeah let just check this once I guess it was marks and yeah you're doing question n right no no it's question six",
  "doing question n right no no it's question six I guess okay oh that is G2 it is from G2 I guess this is the structure that we want so we want marks and thenk uh so we want a Json that have marks as a key and then list as a value of that key all right do we do we want these uh this to be enclosed in a list as well no no no no no all right all right so that should work let's run it okay it's taking it sweet time so that's the problem with running it all right so it's working that's good so let's",
  "it all right so it's working that's good so let's try it using multiple names it's not here yeah run this this big name and it should be working perfectly fine because it was returning us uh array let's run it all right so it's working perfectly fine so basically it's a logic issue in the Cod yeah it was a logic issue and uh perhaps I while debugging I just I just went over this particular piece of code and you know paste something else the Handler works fine just that the logic was not correct",
  "works fine just that the logic was not correct yeah can you scroll down a little bit uh yes the entire operations that we did is right over here yes sir okay sir and then last also we change some marks equal in response in response oh yeah I just made this yes sir because that's the output that's required yeah I just you know simplify one thing I would recommend sakshi is you know when Roe comes around and even for project as well just be familiar with how to par through uh dictionary and array",
  "with how to par through uh dictionary and array structures okay because uh if you look at op API calls that we send and uh even the responses we get back you have to be able to pass through them in a systematic way so just be familiar with that if you know how to pass through then you'll be able to handle these sorts of questions and Roe will 100% I will tell you now only will have questions that make you pass through nested dictionaries okay sir thank you sir yeah so that's uh that's where the",
  "thank you sir yeah so that's uh that's where the problem is actually also passing through dictionaries is you know much more easier than passing through lists because then you have to you know run a for entire for Loop you have to give an if if statement as well so passing through dictionaries it's like a like it's a piece of cake okay simply enter the dictionaries name so this is a dictionary actually this query parameter is a dictionary which we which are we are also printing right over here",
  "we which are we are also printing right over here let me just show you so we are actually printing the name so this is a dictionary and and uh it's getting the key value of name so this is just just like basic python okay so you should know this and uh obviously it was Roe needs this you you should have this knowledge right so this this problem has been solved yeah sir one more thing uh what was the what will be the duration for Roe means what will be the time period given for the Roe that",
  "will be the time period given for the Roe that varies from term to term so some terms it is as short as 45 minutes other terms it could it has been as long as 1 and a half hours okay sir typically the most important thing to learn about Ro is you will not have enough time so it doesn't matter if it is 45 minutes or an hour and a half okay you'll almost certainly have more questions than you can fully answer in that time frame so you'll have to be very quick in doing basic uh iterations through",
  "very quick in doing basic uh iterations through the these sorts of structures also during my Roe it was a 45 minute Roe and uh I will give you some tips that whenever you solve a question always save it okay always submit the answer so you can it's just like simple uh GA so you can just simply save your answers whenever you have you're done with it okay so sub S one thing I want to make a there's one difference this time we will be Autos saving students answers we'll be having that incorporated",
  "answers we'll be having that incorporated into so that won't be an issue this time all right so because at when I was doing Roe so it was a big issue because people were that yeah there was it was marked that it will be ending at 8 I guess it was 6:00 p.m. something like that so it would be ending in 1 hour but it actually ended at exactly 45 minutes so uh lucky I saved it few minutes before that and I just passed that and so people who I mean we took all those feedback and improved it so this",
  "took all those feedback and improved it so this time we'll have auto save feature that's really good okay and what will be the uh passing percentage for RO uh mean there is no pass percentage it's just whatever you get there's no pass criteria for RO okay sir also one more thing whenever let's say you are you have completed four questions but let's say the an RO contains eight questions and you have successfully completed four questions but the time is taking out okay so it's just going to end",
  "time is taking out okay so it's just going to end in let's say 30 seconds so I would recommend you simply randomly select options okay randomly select the uh multiple choice questions if they are there okay and then save it because uh let's say if your luck is good then you will be able to score more no sir my luck is very bad but thank you for the suggestion yeah so actually this suggestion uh yeah also sakshi uh now that your problem has been solved both of your problems have been solved but",
  "solved both of your problems have been solved but I will still recommend you to post it on discourse because then we will be able to answer it over there and then multiple people will be able to you know take benefit from our answers yeah yes sir sure sir I will uh post on discour uh the questions do it for both question nth question sir uh for the class variable name mhm for that will I will uh definitely uh post on the discourse I can please repeat uh sir should I enter the code also for the",
  "uh sir should I enter the code also for the uh a uh for that um class variable file yeah what you can do s is uh since you know the solution you can post the issue you had first and also post the solution as well so that way uh you know you helped your fellow students you know to know that you had this problem and this is what the solution you came up with so that would be good sure sir so uh so do I have to post this question as well sir uh for the uh this one was a you had a logic error in",
  "the uh this one was a you had a logic error in this one right because the code we just checked it actually works the only issue that we then we were facing was the file access so I don't know in your original code I don't have your original code but check the file path is correct and uh the logic part was the only part that was not working correctly for you right so in that situation it's wouldn't be necessary because logic we normally expect students to be able to work that out on their own",
  "students to be able to work that out on their own and uh the file path error you could mention about the file path error that this is where the file needs to be located and then it will work correctly so uh but logic is not necessary because that is something every student should actually be able to work out yes sir thank you sir okay okay great thank you any more questions no sir and thank you very much sir for the solving the problems which I had yeah also there was one more error so you",
  "I had yeah also there was one more error so you actually named this file b r SEL so that's an error so it won't be able to recognize what all build build instructions you have given to it okay so make sure it you should have this particular you know icon of versal okay sir I will remember it sir okay so all right guys if we have no other no further questions we can close this meeting it's already been you know 3 hours right thanks jaaj s and thank you everyone all right bye guys thank you sir",
  "you everyone all right bye guys thank you sir bye good night good night [Applause]",

  "see my application no yeah this is the one that we were using yesterday okay uh so we created this piece of code yesterday and what it does actually uh we have got two functions over here so this is order function which allows any customer to place an order on some uh some website which allows you to place orders so this is a list that needs to be passed for example you want to order a laptop and then these many numbers of laptop then where you want to it to get delivered and then at what time",
  "want to it to get delivered and then at what time it needs to be delivered so this is the function that places the order so basically what it does it will first generate a uh unique identifier for order ID and then it will calculate total price based on the number of items that were there and those prices for individual items are listed in this particular uh dictionary and then what we are doing we are appending it to a data frame order andore DF that have information about uh all the orders so",
  "that have information about uh all the orders so it have customer ID order ID and then total price and then these are the items and then delivery address and delivery time so all this information is here but here what we are doing we are passing refined refined parameters so they this is a list and then within this list there are two objects right but we might be interested in uh let us say if you just pass plain English that I want to place an order for following item let us say I want one",
  "an order for following item let us say I want one laptop two smartphone and one tablet and then I ask what would be the total price and then the delivery address is this and then I want delivery by this particular date and now we don't have this information this uh structured information is not available with us and then what we have done we have actually requested openi uh using chat completions URL and the same headers and then this is the request body and here this Q This Q is the same",
  "request body and here this Q This Q is the same prompt that I want to order these many things right and at the end what I want to do I want to get response back from llm in this particular format so that I can I can execute this function order function so how we can do that we'll actually create a uh Json schema okay and we'll pass that Json schema over here so in Json schema what we have it's type is function and then uh it will now Define what this function is supposed to do so this function",
  "this function is supposed to do so this function have name as order so this is the same name so we have created a python function called order and this particular function takes three parameters items delivery address and delivery time so these three parameters we will have to Define right so here I have provided the description of that function this function allows us to get a prompt from customer and then we can we we need to extract data in Json format so that we can execute the function so",
  "format so that we can execute the function so here I have defined each of those parameters so this is of type object and then these are the property so ordered items is a property so this is ordered items right and for each of these elements what we have we have item name that is uh a string and then quantity that is integer so that's what I have defined over here that ordered items are is an array and this is description of that particular array that it is list of items and then I have defined",
  "that it is list of items and then I have defined the properties of individual items so it have item name and then quantity and the information about them is listed here and then uh we want more information such as delivery address so that's what I have defined here um it needs to be string and then this is description and then this delivery time it needs to be string and then the time the order needs to be delivered so these are the parameters that are required for order function okay and",
  "that are required for order function okay and that's what we have defined here and then this required keyword the purpose of this required keyword is so that we get from llm back we just get the uh things that are required for example I just need quantity and item name and I don't want any additional properties so uh so this is one response that we got from llm and above I have created two functions one is to place order and then the other function is to delete the order so deleting order means",
  "is to delete the order so deleting order means to cancel the order and for canceling an order what I need I just need order ID so I will give a prompt something like this I want to cancel my order for order ID this okay and then uh when I send a request to llm using this uh that um prompt as user message then we will get back this response from LL that um so here we have function keyword and within function we have name which defines which function should be executed actually we have defined it",
  "should be executed actually we have defined it here so name of the function so we have created two functions one is to place an order and then the other one is to delete the order so this function it have identified that this function needs to be called and these are the parameters that we need to use for uh calling that function so order ID and this particular order ID and here we have defined the delete order function which takes order ID and then it actually deletes those orders okay uh that",
  "it actually deletes those orders okay uh that was from the last session and now what I will do I will actually uh use this piece of code and then I will create a um web application or using it so is everyone on board with what's going on because this was from last night it was just a recap of what we did in the previous session it helped thank you okay any other questions okay if there are no questions then we'll proceed yeah if I been following all the sessions I should be able to do the ga2",
  "all the sessions I should be able to do the ga2 right EAS uh yeah I mean ga2 is not uh there is a small aspect of ga2 probably in this so that should not be an issue but uh when it comes to the llm parts uh then these are mostly to do with ga3 uh but ga2 the only aspect will be will be deying this now as an application and then we'll be packaging it into Docker so that's the thing that we be doing here but in case you didn't understand the workflow or what's happening uh just you know feel free",
  "or what's happening uh just you know feel free to open your mic and ask okay and then we can explain it conceptually seems clear like I not attempted it because I I was busy with some work so but I I hope I can do it today okay that's good just one quick doubt I had on the delete order uh aspect it says if the prompt or the text says delete this order ID um could it go wrong here for example the the text may have multiple things it could match with multiple orders and a wrong ID gets deleted so",
  "multiple orders and a wrong ID gets deleted so yeah so that's a good question um we are not building a very robust application at the moment uh the whole idea is to actually demonstrate this capability that uh GPT has which is by taking natural language um can we convert the natural language into functions or application understands so typically what used to happen is there would be an interface between the application and the customer so that interface would either be a website or some local",
  "interface would either be a website or some local application running on your phone or your computer and these would be very precisely crafted so that the inputs from those uh front ends as it were they would uh precisely map to functions within our application right okay so but uh crafting these things first of all takes a lot of time lot of technical expertise and the second problem is uh it needs to be maintained okay and there are a lot of issues with the with that approach okay it has",
  "of issues with the with that approach okay it has worked well for the better part of um two decades but um now if I gave you an option between um having two different types of interaction with the business uh where a you fill in all these details manually into this precisely designed site or you just speak naturally as if you're speaking to a human being so imagine you had like a personal assistant and you said okay I want you to go to big Bazaar and just buy these items uh and that's all you",
  "and just buy these items uh and that's all you had to do you spent like literally five you know maybe 5 seconds or one minute telling the PA what you wanted uh which approach would you prefer speaking to the person who's going to get it for you or doing all these things manually yes speaking works better but someone may say I do not want this rather than using the word cancel I don't know if the model but as you said it's not as robust probably those things would be covered okay so the prompt",
  "those things would be covered okay so the prompt will be organic you can give any kind of prompt there and uh because uh GPT is uh able to understand nuance and language semantics uh we can put any kind of so your application is not looking to respond exact to these words what we do is we send these words to GPT and ask GPT what function should we run and what are the parameters that are required to run so that's what U um GPT will do for us so in other words it doesn't have to be phrased",
  "so in other words it doesn't have to be phrased exactly this way if GPT can extract and tell us what function are so our application has a set number of functions in this particular case there are only two functions but you can imagine a system where there are say 50 functions but you want to interact in normal language to the system um and so an example we gave was like a travel agent right you go to a travel agent and say I I'm thinking of a taking a holiday can you suggest me some places I",
  "taking a holiday can you suggest me some places I can go to that is nice in the month of February um so then uh the travel agent may give you some options but that actually would be a function in your system to find places that are uh uh that have high reviews for February travels right so if that's uh function is to run but how do we get that from natural language we don't we are not able to do it right so that's what we do we take the natural language question send it to GPT ask GPT and the",
  "language question send it to GPT ask GPT and the other thing we send to GPT so we not just send the prompt or the question but we also send GPT a list of tools that we are able to run so we send both things we send the customers request and we send our applications capabilities to GPT as well and we tell look GPT this is what the customer is asking this is what we are able to do these are the functions we are able to do tell us which function we should run uh in order to um respond to the",
  "we should run uh in order to um respond to the request that the customer has given us so GPT will look at that and say yes you need to run the function that uh fetches this exact data which is places uh that are nice to go to and the parameter is February for example and then what happens is it gives us that as structured information it will be a Json because we have instructed GPT give us structured information and the structured information it sends back is name of the function and the",
  "it sends back is name of the function and the parameters it should run and that's exactly what we're doing okay thank you okay so the same code now let's create a web application using it so I think I will use fast API so uh one one one thing um yes an yeah so what I was asking is while you are using vs code and in vs code you are using the the uh the python file yes uh can we do the same thing using the these what do you call uh um python notebooks uh from Anaconda like the base environment",
  "uh from Anaconda like the base environment will be Anaconda um yes we can do it using python notebooks but then uh I want no here also here also okay uh actually what I want to do at the end I want to execute this script using UV right and I think I won't be able to do that using python is one thing I mean sorry within notebook so if I create a notebook then I don't know how I will execute this I will turn up this particular port number if if I were to run it inside a Docker environment J just",
  "were to run it inside a Docker environment J just one thing this leaf on on your extensions the left column Leaf okay mongod mongodb right okay yeah okay okay so so just simply we will create a new file and app.py will be okay yeah so usually notebooks the use case for notebooks is to create uh interactive uh um one I will sh like in one of the companies I'm like working for I let him complete what he's trying to say yeah so normally uh notebooks are generally for interactive development right",
  "are generally for interactive development right so you have code cells and uh you are able to then execute various um code cells to uh work out various aspects of your application and then you're able to share it with with others who are also able to then examine section by section the various interactive bits of your code so you're able to uh it's a step up from just a single page or a single um file application or a multi file application but it has certain limitations when you have a a block",
  "has certain limitations when you have a a block like that because you can't uh prescribe a defined order of execution in a notebook uh whereas in script files they just run from top to bottom or they follow some looping logic or they follow some branching logic that's easy to uh Trace through the program so there's a defined way of running in a script whereas in notebooks you you have these code cells that may not necessarily uh be able to Branch from one section to another section reasonably",
  "from one section to another section reasonably well right so from a development point of view uh it's usually better to use uh notebooks just as a as a way of preparing or uh debugging your code or various aspects of your code that's what I generally find and then when it comes to production environment code then you have to put it together into an into a fully functional application which is what we what putting it into a script file like a py will py file will do so that's um what I wanted to",
  "py file will do so that's um what I wanted to say uh so yeah rck you were going to say add something or correct me I'm wrong it is just like this only uh whatever whatever you said is correct that if you want to for example I want to create a pipeline to process some data is like huge data right but then uh I won't be able to do it on a continuous basis because is being collected manually but it's in a specific format it is coming from tally or some other software right and and then uh I I need",
  "other software right and and then uh I I need to train somebody who does not have all this specific knowledge but they need to process this data they get the files upload them uh into this collab notebook actually understand all the steps debug if necessary and process it in some Tableau or other data analytics tool right so I I make this file with all the entire Pipeline with commands and debugging steps and everything and they just uh take 10 15 minutes to read through it and complete the",
  "10 15 minutes to read through it and complete the work right I do not have to physically be there to actually explain the code to them or something I have commented them and I've segmented the code with debugging steps and everything uh in the collab notebook itself so in that way it becomes very easy to kind of uh share the uh technical information with the your teammates yeah so that's that's exactly right so what sorry gon I just wanted like U like I just wanted to know what he was uh what",
  "U like I just wanted to know what he was uh what he was saying so you are saying that uh the collab file will be used along with the comments so that it uh like it removes the dependency of the person who has created it uh so it's used in a shared development environment in other words um so say for example I'm working on a project and jrj is working on the same sort of project but we working on different aspects of it or J or JJ has a very high skill versus I have a very low skill uh so he's",
  "skill versus I have a very low skill uh so he's say for example he's a senior developer and I'm a junior developer um so what he can do is he can create this uh notebook with various code blocks that do a small uh specified function okay uh and then he can he can add markdown to it which is the which is the key innovation in uh in uh uh notebooks which is you have these code blocks that run independently and you have um markdown that goes with it so that documentation is Rich um and then he",
  "it so that documentation is Rich um and then he passes it on to me I don't even have to know how the code works right so I can then read the markdown and see okay this code block will do this it's almost like I can pretend it's a black box for me and then just hit the play button and it'll run that bit of code now you can see how this could be useful even with Senior Management because what what you can happen is let's say you don't have a production ready software available yet okay but you're",
  "ready software available yet okay but you're still in the development phase and you're going to test various functionality or bits or pieces of things that you want to test out and you want to show your progress to Senior Management who don't understand code at all so you'll say okay look I've created for example this model just hit this play button okay and just above it above this model are some inputs you can give it to so when you um uh give these inputs in this top code block cell just uh",
  "these inputs in this top code block cell just uh put your variables that you want to change here and then hit this play button then uh they are able to interact with your code directly without uh much technical knowledge but that doesn't work in a production environment because in a production environment you go back to traditional forms of running applications which is there is um a continuous flow of uh the program right where there's a start and end point there are branching bits of code it",
  "and end point there are branching bits of code it has to be able to do various things react to various situations uh respond to events that are occurring uh that may happen asynchronously so a lot of things happen continuously in a production environment that a code a Jupiter notebook does not is not designed to handle the use case of a jupyter notebook is completely different from the use case of running production environment code if uh if if you that makes sense yeah yeah than thanks R",
  "if you that makes sense yeah yeah than thanks R thanks Caron so so app.py will make like files will suffice whatever we are trying to do cor right so what we are going to do now is we used the Jupiter notebook because it was easy to as a teaching tool now we're going to take all that code put it into actual running uh fully functional uh program that doesn't require any manual intervention and uh so it's going to set up so in this situation what JJ is going to he's going to actually set up a",
  "JJ is going to he's going to actually set up a server that's going to host the application so he's going to run a server and then the application will be running on this server and that will all be handled within this single file and sometime it can be multifile as well but the concept Still Remains the Same even if it's multifile uh actually what happens on the back end is it looks at all the dependencies and the modules it has to import it brings it all together into one cohesive package the",
  "it all together into one cohesive package the files are just there so that for our development purposes it's convenient for us to debug but once the application is running it actually pulls in all these dependencies together and makes it into one fully coherent block of code that the machine can understand and run and execute good good great okay so I will need to import request as well so I will just mention it here and then we will need to create a data frame okay let's do that before you um",
  "a data frame okay let's do that before you um make it more complex just at each stage just run the um server so that we know that at each stage uh it's working correctly and students then also can understand uh what's happening as well run the run the application before you make it complex oh okay you mean remove all this no no you can you can keep keep keep everything except the Panda's data frame okay this one question like the UV files can be packaged but even the files with requirement. txt",
  "packaged but even the files with requirement. txt can be packaged as well right or do they not work so UV the the major major advantage of UI is similar to how um for example Docker is a major major advantage for deploying applications uh with UV you don't have to um do anything except mention your dependencies so with requirements. text what happens is you usually pip install things right uh so an environment has to be created and you can create a pipeline that does those things but the pipe",
  "a pipeline that does those things but the pipe the virtual environments uh have to be sort of manually managed if I can use that word Loosely so what I mean by manually ad managements there's got to be either a person dealing with it or a script has to be maintained to deal with the virtual environment and once the virtual environment is created it remains persistent on the system right so if you want to avoid all those issues where you have a um an just the application file okay so just the py",
  "an just the application file okay so just the py file and not deal with importing the dependencies not deal with disposing the virtual environment and creating the virtual environment um so then what happens is you're limiting the application's lifetime and its dependencies only to the time when it's running right as soon as it stopped running you don't want any of those things sitting on your system anymore except the code so that's what UI does UI beautifully does that where you just tell it",
  "UI beautifully does that where you just tell it at the top of the code block these are the uh dependencies that this application requires so when you send it off to someone you don't have to worry about anything just you give the requirements at the top of your code block and just send your code that person then is able to use UV and it will handle everything from start to finish where it will import the dependencies it will create the virtual environment run the application and then when it's",
  "run the application and then when it's done it will get rid of all those things as well so then you don't have to worry about it so use case for it I'll give you is last terms project to we had seven nearly 700 sub submissions all of them had completely different uh package requirements all of them were designed on completely different uh operating systems computers uh had different completely different uh setups everything Etc and what UV was able to do for us is we were able to just take only",
  "to do for us is we were able to just take only the GitHub code that they had given us and then we were able to test all their applications one after another using a single script uh and it was able to do that automatedly for all the 700 applications that's brilliant yeah so that's I mean it's amazing right imagine the amount of time and effort it saves us and we don't have to worry about uh code failure or any of these sorts of issues in in the middle so it's it's fantastic it really supersedes",
  "so it's it's fantastic it really supersedes pip install if I if I could say yeah carry yeah uh J if it's okay can you show once again and like yeah sure so this is the application that we have created just initialization of application and then I have created one route and then the so what that will do it will just say print as in key and then value as in hello so what's happened here is he's created basically a server that responds to endpoints in your browser and currently it's running on his",
  "in your browser and currently it's running on his local system that's why it says Local Host and it's uh interacting at Port 8,000 so this IP address Local Host can have thousands of applications running on it uh but this particular application we have told okay we wanted to interact only on Port 8,000 so any incoming responses have to come on 8,000 and any outgoing responses also will interact through the through that Port so the browser then when you put Local Host 8,000 is uh the system is",
  "when you put Local Host 8,000 is uh the system is the browser sending that request to uh that address Local Host which in this case is 000000 or in some systems it'll be 127.0.0.1 um and then uh it knows that okay it has to send this request to Port 88000 what is the request it's that you see that slash app.get the home directory that's the uh request that it's sending so it's sending a get request but what's sitting at the end of that uh applic sorry at that end of that end point when it",
  "sorry at that end of that end point when it reaches the destination which is this application is it will hit this function define uh root function and this function has a return value that return value it sends back to the person who requested it who's the requesting person it's your browser so that's the workflow it's exact ly the way a a web server works this is in fact a very it's very fundamental basic level this is a a minimalistic web server which does nothing except say it returns a Json",
  "which does nothing except say it returns a Json that says hello okay so uh this UV ion is the same UV which we have learned over there uh no that that is to run this particular server so you feon it is not related to UV uh command line tool so UV command line tool would run this application it will install all those dependencies and then it will run this application but uor is responsible for uh creating This Server and running the server on this particular Port okay so so uh sorry like I might",
  "particular Port okay so so uh sorry like I might sound very we so U this UV thing we will be installing in in the terminal once we have written all these things yeah U you would have to install okay okay okay like simply pip install UV yeah inst okay okay so now I will start copying from here so I will first initialize the data frame to store the orders and I will also have to import pandas so I will have to put pandas in in the dependencies is the website for uon is U con.org right uh I'm not",
  "the website for uon is U con.org right uh I'm not sure about it I'm saving it in my bookmarks for key tools just for reference but so just to be sure yeah I think this is the one okay python web server what is asgi um by the way Anand it's not pip install okay it's a UV is a package you install using python itself no actually it can be installed using pip like the thing is the the the the thing is well I was trying everything when I just typed by mistake pip install it installed by like in the",
  "mistake pip install it installed by like in the terminal itself um in vs code and the total size was around 14 MB so that's the only thing which I remember from G1 M so I thought like where we are fitting that one so okay okay so now I have initialized database I will just in Port pandage so here we have defined this particular order andore DF data frame okay and now I want to be able to use this particular piece of code because I will get these variables from environment itself so [Music] how",
  "variables from environment itself so [Music] how do I export a variable and import it and use it what a variable from B so okay I think I will have to use this and the name of the token is AI proxy and then I will also have to import OS okay um okay now let's test if this works so in here here I what I will do I will return the token instead of message and I will just export a dummy token over here is it okay you have not specifi the token so you can export anything yeah yeah so I will just",
  "you can export anything yeah yeah so I will just exported me token maybe this thing hello from Bash and now whatever I have exported I will have to use the same name so I will change this to myw and I will rerun the server okay now when I will hit this particular end point then I should get that value that I have initialized uh so hello from bash should appear let's check yes it works so we are basically uh exporting a variable into the environment and then from environment it is picking up",
  "and then from environment it is picking up that variable so that we can use it inside the script so basically this is to keep all those Secrets hidden so if I have a if I have a a proxy token then I don't want to keep it here so I want to keep it out so I I don't want to keep it as in part of this script so that's why so what I will do now I will just export my actual AI proxy token so I will take this terminal to some other screen and so why aren't we doing this on the terminal which is there",
  "we doing this on the terminal which is there on vs code yeah we can do that actually there are uh same so if we can even uh export something from here because this is also a bash terminal only okay BH terminal so you running on okay WS to F yeah this is Ws to so on Mac will it be Zs such or like we need to change it from here Mac you can use whichever terminal you want Mac by default has a zsh terminal even have to bother about anything in Mac it runs natively yeah I mean you can you but you",
  "it runs natively yeah I mean you can you but you can if you are more comfortable with bash you can install the bash terminal for mac and use just bash also so that also not comfortable with anything but just so what I'm saying like will will will that zsh will suffice whatever we are doing over here oh yeah yeah I mean zsh and Bash are very closely related in its capabilities I mean there are some minor differences but they just uh they will run the same Linux commands without any issues okay",
  "the same Linux commands without any issues okay okay okay so an then we can even export it from here both of them are same actually so I won't I mean I'm not using that because I I can get some extra space to write code and terminal is running in some other window that's so now I have exported the AI proxy token and now we can bring it back here maybe you could do split screen and then run both simultaneously if you want to okay let's do it in vs code then okay so now we have loaded this CI",
  "vs code then okay so now we have loaded this CI proxy token now what I want to do I want to uh create the headers for the application but that is part of request before that I need to Define these two functions that that are responsible for ordering something so so earlier I I had this app.get so which allows to uh make a request for get get function on this particular endpoint but now I haven't uh mentioned at theate app.get or something so this is this would act as an normal function that is",
  "is this would act as an normal function that is there in Python and now I will also copy this function that allows to delete an order and I will also have to import uid so okay and one once I have all those functions I will also need Json okay so now we have create set up this application and now I will Define the functions that this these function that we need to send to open so I will copy this from here and it so what I'm trying to do I will send a request to open let us say this was the a",
  "send a request to open let us say this was the a prompt that we need to send so actually rather than keeping this prompt over here within this get function we can pass uh the prompt from uh URL encoded parameter so we can pass it in the URL itself and then we can read that parameter and then we can uh pass it to openi from there so these are the two functions that we are using okay and this is the request part that is there okay this seems to be correct so before that I will need URL to re make",
  "correct so before that I will need URL to re make a request so copy from here and then we'll also require headers and the name of this particular token must match with what we have loaded from environment so and this prompt would come from the parameter so okay later we'll put it in parameter for now let's keep it uh within this function itself so at the very top I will Define this prompt and I think this is all that we require we have order function we have delete order function and then we",
  "we have delete order function and then we have this get method and within get method we have this query and then we have all these functions that needs that go will go to open and then we'll get the response okay now I will just return whatever comes in the response and let's try this code so I will do UV run app dop okay now because Jason was not found in the package registry and you require Jason okay I think Jason is pre-installed so I will have to remove it and is there something else that",
  "to remove it and is there something else that I need to mention no be none is invalid uh G is invalid invalid compact gws P none is invalid oh okay why it is none I have actually exported [Music] it let me check where have you can you show the EnV file uh no I don't have it in EnV file it is I have exported it from the environment itself okay maybe just put it an env. EnV file or or this exporting from the environment works I guess yeah you can you can always view the path variable from",
  "can you can always view the path variable from environment anywhere okay uh I will just unshare my screen and I will check what is wrong with it EO dollar I proxy okay so what I have done I have just exported the variable again and now we can actually run this particular application and let's run it so and let's format it so yeah it is getting us this particular thing that we need to call order function and then these are the arguments that we need to use okay so now I will actually copy the",
  "need to use okay so now I will actually copy the code that is required to update order uncore DF so this is what okay so here we have I want to get these arguments so these are the ordered items and these individual items we need and then delivery address and delivery time these are the three things that we need to get so this particular piece of code would get the arguments so this is the argument keyword and whatever is the value to this argument we will get it using this piece of code so it",
  "we will get it using this piece of code so it actually first goes to choices so it goes to this choices and then within choices it gets to zero index so which is I think this one and then within zero index it goes to Tool calls so this is tool calls and then within that also we need to go to zero index and this nesting when we'll hit arguments it will have this particular segment of response and then we can actually call the order function and then we can place an order so now now I will copy",
  "then we can place an order so now now I will copy this piece of code from here to the application and then I will also need to have function to be called and now based on what function it needs to call I will have if it needs to call order function then we will get uh which all items that needs to be ordered and these things so I will get these information from argument okay what is that and now I have all these arguments so I can actually call this function but for that I also need customer ID",
  "function but for that I also need customer ID so I will manually set it to one for now and maybe later we can change it Ian we can even make it Dynamic but for now I will just keep it one and then I will actually make a call to this particular function which takes these items and then it takes delivery address and then delivery time when it needs to be delivered and let us say we want to return that order pleased successfully so now whenever I go back here and then first I will have to rerun",
  "go back here and then first I will have to rerun uvon server I think and now I will just refresh this particular page and okay um internal server error let us check prices is not defined okay uh so prices is the dictionary that I need to copy from here which defines prices of every single item okay let's run internal server okay prices is not defined okay I have just find prices oh okay okay it needs to be in the global um oh it got stopped so I will again start and I will just use this so I",
  "I will again start and I will just use this so I will have to Define prices over here instead of defining it inside this function because this order function is outside so that's why and now I think it will work oh yeah order play successfully so actually instead of returning order play successfully I will instead print the data frame order score DF div what was the error I missed that part okay so the error was uh um what was the error yeah I haven't defined the prices so okay prices",
  "yeah I haven't defined the prices so okay prices dictionary I didn't Define after that also there was some error now and you said that you change the order of that order function or or something in in what way did you change it no there was no error with order function okay okay error was with this price is not being find found okay so now let's print this order _ DF as well so it should have now printed order DF oh I will have to first rerun this server and let's make one more request and this",
  "server and let's make one more request and this time it should print the order DF so yeah this is the data frame that it have got created so this x is in database at the moment um um like if you can um uh uh have a recap of the like the body where everything should be placed on a fly if that's okay with yeah sure so the these two functions that are from the starting like where the things will be put like first we we will uh this this fast API thing which we have copied from there and then uh",
  "thing which we have copied from there and then uh the global variables which are there like the one which is going to start order dfpd data frame like the sequence I'm trying to get uh like where everything should be pushed from the starting yeah uh okay with the logic right that the script tag is there for handling dependencies with UI and then when we when we start with the Imports fast API we are doing for API request is for the request thing which we do you know and then pandas is for",
  "thing which we do you know and then pandas is for handling data OS is for the getting the environment no these are like the explanation of the of the steps not the steps what like where should each step uh will go because while while we are looking at the while I'm comparing with the collab which we have explained yesterday so I'm trying to learn know where each one of them the the calling should be fitted here so so the things the functions which or the variables which have been explained I",
  "or the variables which have been explained I I'm able to get that but where it should be placed in order to run the app so the application itself Works uh by calling the appropriate function whenever the endpoint is hit so depending on the so the flow of the application only depends on which endpoint is being um used so in this case if it's being used if the order end point is being used then it will uh you know it will go to the appropriate function that executes uh the rest are all just",
  "function that executes uh the rest are all just function definitions Okay small thing is like if you can go down oh I think he has lost connection yeah maybe so what I was asking is for example there was some get thing down there correct before Local Host so what Cotes we need to put after the G and what we need to put above that I was confused with that so whatever we want to uh get in the um in that black screen we need to put it after the get okay yeah so yeah J can you just show the um not",
  "okay yeah so yeah J can you just show the um not the functions themselves but the if you go yeah so this is this is the bit right you're talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay yeah so this function okay yeah so the prompt is typically what will come through the uh through whatever interface you're using um and then um this is the functions that have to be defined for open AI to work correctly and then scroll down a bit so again these are just definitions keep going oops Yeah and then um",
  "just definitions keep going oops Yeah and then um once he has defined the function he defines the URL the header uh and these are all required in order to make a a response so this is the request post then he uses so he sends the URL the header and the Json that is before defined before this into the post and then the Json body itself will have these elements that are required because this is the structure that AI proxy requires in order to work correctly and um the functions themselves are",
  "correctly and um the functions themselves are sent as an argument into the tools key if you look on the dictionary over there and uh eventually it goes to the [Music] um once the once you get the response back then what is happening is he's pulling out the details from the response so if you look on there carefully it says response. Json that is coming as a result of the request we have made to open a so he's just parsing that Json that he gets back storing it in arguments and parsing the Json",
  "back storing it in arguments and parsing the Json to get the function to be called so that comes out of the response and finally you get uh um an if block which deals with uh what so when once we get a function we need to match it map it to something in our application right so that's what he's doing next which is he's mapping the response to the application that sorry to the function that the application should run and then he's return once that appropriate function is running uh has been run",
  "appropriate function is running uh has been run then it returns a response to the user so that's the workflow does that thanks so so so while he has got the Json file response. Json uh this import do like this the the last thing if if double double Dunder name yeah will print it on the port number 8,000 no no no no no no this no no that so the if underscore name main that is an entry point for your application so what happens is when the inter when the python interpreter runs if it finds that",
  "when the python interpreter runs if it finds that this so what py interpret does is it just goes from top to bottom looks at everything that's there in the file but it won't uh run the that last block unless this is the starting point of the C unless this file is the starting file of the application see in a multifile uh situation you would have many different modules that are coming together so python interpreter won't know where to start your application from so that if Dunder Dunder name",
  "application from so that if Dunder Dunder name Dunder Dunder equal to main what that tells The Interpreter is if this particular file was the starting file then run this block of code meaning that this is the actual starting point of the application can we think about it this way this is the main file run this one yeah did I mean does did that help or you're you're confused about the dunder D underscore no no no no like I I was able to get whatever was thank you thank you okay thank you I mean",
  "was thank you thank you okay thank you I mean what Happ can you explain it again please I was not able to get why name to start the execution file from that so so what happens is see normally an application won't have a single file correct it'll have multiple files in many places so when you uh run your application once it puts all the files together and all the definitions function definitions and things of that nature uh The Interpreter itself uh will use will um store a variable okay called",
  "uh will use will um store a variable okay called UND underscore name this The Interpreter itself will create this variable under Dunder Dunder name Dunder okay and what it does is in that name it will label this file as main even though it's called app.py okay uh sorry just give me a second okay okay and once it labels that The Interpreter then uh it if it finds so then as it's executing it will say okay if name is equal to main so it knows that this particular file app.py has been given this",
  "this particular file app.py has been given this variable called main so it knows that this is the entry point where to start the application from and so it'll run this block of code that you put in so the first thing it will actually execute is this import uvon and then it will run UV con. run and it will start the server so that's how the application knows this is the starting point of the application okay okay now I got it I mean it will first name the file this file app.py as the main file",
  "name the file this file app.py as the main file and then it will execute it first so whatever files that are present apart from Ab main app.py will be executed later also or according to the instructions provided in app yeah because the yeah that's right because what happens is initially it just pulls up all the information that's required for for all the dependencies all the things that multi multifile application needs right but then it needs to know where the starting point is and the way it",
  "know where the starting point is and the way it knows that is The Interpreter labels the starting file as Main and it stores that as a variable that variable is called Dunder Dunder name Dunder Dunder and so then the the application knows it has to start at this particular file this is the starting point of your application okay got it uh sorry for taking e oh sorry sorry sorry sorry what I was saying I have moved this functions uh variable to the global space so that let us say we create",
  "to the global space so that let us say we create multiple end points one is for ordering and let us say I create another one that is for U cancelling the order so the visibility to this particular functions should be available to both of them right because every time we want to make a request to open I and the only thing that gets changed is this particular prompt but functions needs to be same so instead of putting it inside this order Endo I have made it a global variable okay and now let's",
  "have made it a global variable okay and now let's execute it again so that making it a global variable Global variable is just basically you are putting it outside of any of the functions yeah yeah yeah I'm putting it outside any other function outside the space of this end point okay now let's make a request to this endo and and again we got order place successfully and we are also getting the details of order okay uh now what I want to change I want this as a query parameter so whatever I put",
  "want this as a query parameter so whatever I put over here uh that must come to application so Q is equal to this particular um prompt should go in the query so so I have forgot how to do that is it available in G2 J is it okay if you can increase a font increase the font little bit little bit like two okay yeah over here and over yeah here here here here okay what was the way to actually pass parameters to it I don't exactly know [Music] so response get and okay let me ask GPT how do I pass",
  "get and okay let me ask GPT how do I pass URL encoded parameters to a fast API application server okay this needs to go something like this okay let's try this out and over here I need to pass comma and then it instead of name it should be q and yeah it is a string let's try this out I think this fo okay should it be here no no no no it should not be here it needs to go here inside okay Q should be a string and now let's try this out so now instead of keeping this particular prompt here I will",
  "of keeping this particular prompt here I will remove it from here and I will put it inside the request itself so I will rerun the server and then I will copy the same prompt from this notebook and I think this is the prompt that I need to copy and I will put it here and let's make a request and in the response we have got order placed successfully now let's have a look at this particular thing so over here also we have got uh that uh so it is now printing the current state of _ DF so it is",
  "now printing the current state of _ DF so it is actually making a yeah the the S Str thing which you have rode uh you removed uh you removed from there and then you replaced it with with one Str Str here yeah Str Str is to define the data type so this parameter Q it is a no what you searched what you searched then you wrote a line then you removed it and then then you uh wrote Str Str over here for example the things which you have searched over there uh you like if you can go to that search",
  "there uh you like if you can go to that search where you have made the search oh over here yeah so here okay okay so you replace with category equal to or the Q equal to Str Str then you remove that part and then you moved it to where uh so over here in this piece of code what is happening it is creating the instance of application and then it is creating a route for get request to this particular endo and then these are the two query parameters that will get passed okay so uh like this you can",
  "that will get passed okay so uh like this you can pass those two variable uh parameters so instead of passing query over here we can pass name over there and name will be let us say jrj and then let us see there was one more category so I will need to put an ENT over here and then category would be um let us say TA or rather a student so these are the two parameters that I can pass if I am using this piece of function right so these are the two parameters that I can pass in the get request and",
  "parameters that I can pass in the get request and then I'm also defining the type of that variable so let us say instead of a string it is some integer let us say category is 11 then it must be integer instead of Str Str it should be in over here no no that things those things like will be situation dependent what I'm asking is if you like if uh we'll go to the vs code wait a second I will just restore this prompt yeah so async def def root Q St Str yeah and what it was over there like if you",
  "Str yeah and what it was over there like if you can go to chat GPT okay okay okay okay okay okay so name you so name wasn't required we just had one one prompt which was to be pass so that's why we limited ourself qal Q uh Q is uh Rel with Rel relation to string like category string is written over there so we have written Q string over there because we need not to pass two arguments we just kept it to ourselves we just kept it limited to only one argument over there yes yes that is the only",
  "one argument over there yes yes that is the only argument that we need to pass to llm right okay okay and that root thing like we have get items over there I think root thing uh we can make it anything see uh even if you change it to let us say my it doesn't matter okay okay okay okay okay it's simply like the function whatever you want to name it okay yeah yeah it's that's exactly what it is it's a function name so it's okay okay see the app.get uh is a what is typically called a rapper okay",
  "uh is a what is typically called a rapper okay it's a wrapper around your function so the reason it's called a rapper is because the server uh will get uh um triggered when it sees this slash order in the URL okay but then it doesn't know which function to run when it sees the slash order right it has to search through your code your code could have 50 different functions but doesn't know which function to go to so you so what at the at symbol app.get does is it says if you get this particular",
  "does is it says if you get this particular uh trigger called slash order then run this function that is below and the function is defined here is called uh so the async is just a keyword to say that we will accept asynchronous calls but uh the D def in this case jrj this function name is jrj and it takes um it takes an argument called Q which is the variable name and that argument is of type string so but where will get get this Q from it will come as a part of that endpoint called slash order",
  "as a part of that endpoint called slash order does that help yes yes yes thank you thank you should I create a tunnel for this um no we'll we'll uh there's no need to create a tunnel because you want others to try it is it uh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah that's a good good thing everyone on this uh can then actually access your server directly and send queries of course it might crash your uh system because uh we are not designed robust error handling right so they'd have to send clean queries into",
  "right so they'd have to send clean queries into it but it would be interesting yeah and should I also print the prompt that I got get from yeah yeah you can send back the prompt right and yeah you can print the prompt they send as well so we know what they sending yeah okay let's create a tel then so this is the very excellent demonstration of uh deployability okay you've got something running it's working now you want to show it to your boss okay what uh are we doing here now I actually went",
  "what uh are we doing here now I actually went away for two minutes okay he's uh just deploying his app on through enro so that all of you can actually send it a query [Music] now okay so we have uh the app as it was but now we just using inlock yeah yes and then later we'll create a Docker uh file so please send clean queries okay as in it can have different things in it but just make sure that it matches the um the items that we actually have in our quote unquote database okay how do you start",
  "our quote unquote database okay how do you start with the en just revisit it yeah it's already installed on the system right so yeah that is fine but like what did you do to run it how to install you'll have to watch another session no no not that how how did J run it he must have done it in one or two minutes right yeah just one line he wrote right he wrote en gr en hyphen HTTP hyphen okay I will redo it and this is the command dat sorry could you copy the CU I mean that one example in the",
  "you copy the CU I mean that one example in the chat so we can notify that sure sure sure yeah I mean see the thing in the the query is you don't have to send exactly that query what you do is you as long as you have the items that we have in our database which is a tablet laptop what's the other thing JJ tablet laptop and something else was there right or tablet laptop and a smartphone and a smartphone as long as you send only those things and you send um uh an address and uh when you want it",
  "you send um uh an address and uh when you want it uh then as long as you have those details in your query it doesn't matter how your query looks like okay what what is the end point it was only only Q right yeah Q is the parameter so so how do we structure is it we can put those words anywhere like Q is equal to left of 1 comma 1 something or 319 yeah you can change the wording of uh the prompt and I can't is the prompt copied in chat somewhere I mean it need not to be same prompt you can",
  "I mean it need not to be same prompt you can actually change this prompt let's say I want to place an order maybe I can remove this and uh you can change this prompt as as well so it must have these so you must order laptop yeah yeah it can be anything yeah you can put address and then some other thing okay I okay it's the item the address and the small thing uh like when I tried putting Q uh equal to inverted commas and and I pushed laptop it is showing eror like H yeah q and then inverted",
  "is showing eror like H yeah q and then inverted comma yeah so we need to put in the arguments using inverted commas if I'm getting it correct Q after Q equal to inverted commas laptop so that's how we need need to use this uh website which you have sent or the tool which you have sent no no just pass the uh query directly no need to put any inverted or anything okay okay okay okay okay so that only requires tablet I think Jr if you can show a demonstration of sending uh just a query that will",
  "of sending uh just a query that will help lot of internal sers that is lap T okay if you are using laptop and these things tablet so make use of capital words okay okay okay I mean first letter should be Capital JRA in your browser right just show an example of a query that a person could send okay so you can create a query like I want to order just no no in your browser itself in the browser yeah okay so uh this is enro URL I will just go to this particular URL and then I will append back",
  "this particular URL and then I will append back slash order that is where I want to make a get request and then I will pass a par uh URL encoded parameter for that I will put a question mark and then the name of that parameter and then I will put a equal to and the prompt I have just copied from here itself actually it it is not required you need to put the uh back these codes and these things so I I will just copy this particular prompt and then it would work let's go and I will have to get",
  "it would work let's go and I will have to get visit this particular site so now so what others can do is one one by one maybe you can show your screen and then we can look at what's what you're sending as well I'm ready shall I sh yes yes you can check can you see my screen yeah it is [Music] visible chenai and chenai address by today instead of today just try to keep a date first f maybe I'll just say first so that first of which month just okay what eror I'm also getting this like I also",
  "okay what eror I'm also getting this like I also writing something like please deliver like I want to place order for laptop deliver it to 10 down street by 14 it's not really okay uh just give me one second I will change few things and okay can you can you try now just send one request Ling for [Music] J are you there yeah yeah okay your screen's not visible maybe you can share your screen so we know what's going on okay I'm changing few things for example instead of using request I'm now",
  "for example instead of using request I'm now trying to use httpx so that parallel requests can be allowed uh is my screen visible yep yeah so in request I have so instead of using request Library I'm now trying to use httpx module and I think that might work because it will start sending request parall okay so request does not allow parallel request H yeah it won't allow you to send multiple requests at the same time and I think I will need to put await keyword right uhuh you do await it should",
  "await keyword right uhuh you do await it should still allow for multiple request no I think but request module doesn't support multiple request at the same time didn't know that thank you oh [Music] okay can you try now uh response cannot be used in a wait okay uh GPT have given me this piece of code let me try this out maybe it might work okay so instead of Asing calls right we can just uh just do normal requests for now um okay now I am able to make a order can anyone else try I think now it",
  "make a order can anyone else try I think now it might work oh again it didn't [Music] workon start Jason maybe let me print response. Jason [Music] okay it plays one order here then it works thanks but I don't know why this error is there maybe it is because because of incorrect query can you show your query can you like paste your query in the chat because like I'm doing it it's not really working for me or maybe it is problem with my application itself it work once and now it's back to error",
  "itself it work once and now it's back to error [Music] okay let's okay now I'm getting null response H that's because I have copy I have stopped sending any response okay so I just want to look at what all requests are coming so in this particular request what time do you want to order on this particular date oh okay it is asking for the time it looks like you want to order a laptop but I need more detail how many laptops do you want to order what is the delivery address to to the order and",
  "what is the delivery address to to the order and what time do you want the order to be placed so jaraj maybe you can add a little bit of extra code which says if the response is not the Json that is expected then um send that send that response back to the user instead of um you know crashing out um okay yeah we can do that and I think if so now what I want to [Music] provide so this lies within I think choices it is a zero and then within message it's content okay within message it is content",
  "it's content okay within message it is content I guess the important question is how do you differentiate between a prompt coming back and a um function uh sorry a Json function response coming back how do you differentiate between the two so one of them see all of them have messages but one will have tool calls and the other one is presumably does not have tool calls correct it have choices I think choices is correct then zero index and then message it have and then I think this is content and",
  "it have and then I think this is content and let's if yeah so the the key the key over here is if uh if it has tool calls or not right if tool calls is present then you know it has made the the right uh it has given a function to as a response if tool calls is not present then you know it is a PR that's coming back and I think I can put not of tool oh what also one more thing Jr did you in your message did you put the system message that you had last yesterday because we had a similar problem",
  "last yesterday because we had a similar problem yesterday you know in uh yeah system message we have yeah okay so you can put one more thing there maybe if uh in system message yeah so there are two ways to deal with it one is um we can create a third another function which is if parameters are not present then run this function so then it's a very clean way of dealing with it but for now we will stick with this and uh check if a tool call has come back or not if a tool call hasn't come back",
  "come back or not if a tool call hasn't come back then we can send back the prompt to the user H okay so I think this would work then okay I think can uh I think now it will work so the same prompt where it failed uh yeah this is the prompt don't send just Json the full Json send back the message itself yeah message content is okay I think uh one more thing is also if uh we don't need time right in our um date time delivery thing so you can say if time is not present ignore or some something",
  "if time is not present ignore or some something like that you can make your prompt a bit more robust yeah yeah that can be made but for now let's stick to this right yeah okay so now I will make one um the prom that I am using and I think I can use this one maybe okay it's still not working it says this particular key ER Key is not present I'm not sure how to do this maybe this might work now if it doesn't work now then I will just go ahead and create a Docker application a Docker container",
  "create a Docker application a Docker container [Music] okay okay I don't exactly maybe removing this might work have you intentionally kept that space after apop for SC if um um jaraj just as a matter of curiosity shouldn't it be in keys of the response it's not if tool calls in it's got to be a key right dot keys I think is the reason for the error normally Diaries have dot Keys okay um I think even we can look for the the key of dictionary by In This Way okay well it's I've not tried it this",
  "In This Way okay well it's I've not tried it this way usually I explicitly mention do Keys okay okay then let me use do Keys then um JJ yeah I just placed an order and it is showing the message that it has been placed successfully M yeah uh yeah okay so it have some problem with the error handling part that we have haven't implemented correctly it is not going to this particular the key err tool calls and you set to in the terminal it's tool and we have tools is it tool calls oh okay and also",
  "we have tools is it tool calls oh okay and also it should be not in right okay now it's sending response now it is working it's show that I need quantity of the laptop you would like to order please could you please provide the information great great then now it handles all those errors so if there is something that needs to be that is required then it will ask for that okay great great it works now okay so now we can create a Docker application I will just turn off this tunnel fantastic it's",
  "I will just turn off this tunnel fantastic it's fantastic order play successfully yeah it's interactive as well so even if something is wrong with the order it prompts you back to correct your order so that's really good okay now let's create a Docker file and I think it's to F and I will go to G2 again and there was a there was code for it so I will just copy that code and this piece of code and over here I will have to change few things so uh over here it's using Python and then it what it is",
  "here it's using Python and then it what it is doing it is setting up a working directory and that is BAS backlist app within container and then it will uh run this particular command that will create app. P inside container with this particular so it will have this code okay I print hello world will be the line of code uh okay let me just create that application over here but that would add files to your app.py right May H wouldn't it override your app.py no it won't override my app.py that is",
  "app.py no it won't override my app.py that is because it will create a file within container right okay within the container okay yeah so now we have this particular file and now all I need to do I need to run this piece of Command right or rather this one no no first I will have to build the image and so what we are doing over here this do dot tells us where it should look for Docker file so it will look for the docker file in current working directory and what does py hello mean and py hello",
  "and what does py hello mean and py hello is a tag so it can be anything we can even so this is just to identify this particular image so when when you are searching on doer then you can use these tags you can use TDS hello or something something that it's like podman build TXS TDS hello so that SLT maybe is for tag then dot you do something yeah yeah and Dot is for uh telling that where your doer file is present in the current directory yeah it is present in the current directory that's why I'm",
  "present in the current directory that's why I'm just using dot okay okay if it is some other directory then I will just pass the path of that directory okay so now I think it will build the image yeah it have successfully built that particular image and and now we can actually run this particular uh image so it is searching for this particular tag right it is trying to identify this image using the name of the tag and then it will open it will run it inside a interactive shell and I will need",
  "run it inside a interactive shell and I will need to pass bash over here so now wait you changed the tag right it's TDS hello now okay okay uh yeah it's TDS hello and why bash had the last uh bash is to open it in this terminal so so if I if I look over here then we have this app. PI right and it have changed the location right so whatever the ter the container got created so container you can think of it as is it as an vir environment or something virtual virtual machine kind of thing and it",
  "virtual virtual machine kind of thing and it have its own resources so I need to go to its uh uh directory and then I should be able to use its terminal so that's why I have put bash over here so basically I'm trying to access the resources of the container that we created so J I'm forgetting one thing like U when we open vscore we obviously have WSL available in the terminal right and how are we entering this WSL UB 2 thing do we like uh do it via the terminal and doing code in the WSL",
  "do it via the terminal and doing code in the WSL terminal or how do we enter it um yeah I entered code dot in WSL terminal okay so you in the WSL terminal you do this and you enter directly in in this uh remote WSL window yeah yeah so irrespective of the terminal environment we have to write the bash at last yeah that's so that pod so that podman knows what terminal to use in order to run run it interactively because see podman is um doesn't know what resources to use right there is a container",
  "what resources to use right there is a container available you say you want to interact with it and you want to use a terminal to interact with it but it needs to know what terminal you're going to use to interact with it so here we saying we want to use the bash terminal to interact with this virtual I don't want use the word virtual machine but that's effectively what it is this uh Docker image is going to be running inside what is effectively a miniaturized virtual machine and um so to",
  "a miniaturized virtual machine and um so to access this virtual machine normally to access computers remotely you would either use SSH or some sort of uh remote login client or something like that some application you would use right but um in this particular case we are going to interact uh with it using an interactive terminal and uh Docker is able to uh handle all the network connections uh uh in such a way so that we don't have to worry about all those things only all it needs to know is",
  "all those things only all it needs to know is how we are going to connect to it so our interface to this virtual machine is this bash ter that we are seeing and so that's why if you look in the terminal it has opened up actually a new terminal I know it doesn't look like that where it says GV at laptop that is actually the another terminal as in the terminal sitting inside WSL but the new terminal that is inside the virtual machine or this Docker image I should say is what you see root at",
  "Docker image I should say is what you see root at something so whatever you do inside here does not affect anything in his WSL does not affect anything in his Windows environment because it's now you're actually interacting with this machine inside that Docker image and so you're uh even if you delete everything or destroy it it will make no difference to uh the external environment that it is sitting inside did was that clear kind of little bit thank you thank you I think uh maybe little bit",
  "thank you thank you I think uh maybe little bit later after he finishes this I'll just uh do a you know on the notepad I'll just show you what's actually happening because it's a bit difficult to understand when looking at this terminal like this right so what is the build command was is it like pod man run build T something yeah that what that will do that will use this particular Docker file and then it will create a container using it so it will install python in that container and then it",
  "will install python in that container and then it will set up a uh Direct that is app directory um so that is the directory where I am right now in and then it will create a file it will just basically run this particular piece of code and then what it will do it will create app.py file which will have print hello world right so if we just have a look at this and um C.P it have print hello right and then what it does it will execute the file so when you execute a particular file app. py then it",
  "you execute a particular file app. py then it should print this hello world right so instead of opening it in an interactive shell I will just run this particular um image and it should say hello world right that is because it had this particular command that asks it to run this particular uh file so now this was a basic example where it created a hello world basic hello world print hello world application right but what we want we want to copy all this code and it needs to be present inside",
  "all this code and it needs to be present inside the doer so that we can doer image so that we can ex execute it using UV so instead of here it is python app.py it should be UV space run and then that should be three commands Okay and there is a way to copy and I think how do I copy a file from local directory to um Docker container specify it in Docker file I think it is copy command and let's see yeah it is copy command and this is how we can copy it copy a file from local machine to a",
  "can copy it copy a file from local machine to a container okay and let's do that and what is name of the file it is app.py py and fed we want to copy it we want to copy it to this particular working directory and this is the command that we want to run at the end so now I will rebuild this image I will do podman build and then what was the other thingman build and the tag is TDS hello okay no context directory no container file is specified okay I need to build it from the current working",
  "okay I need to build it from the current working directory it have copied okay now I will run this particular doer image that we have just built B man run and I want to run it inside a interactive shell and name of that particular image would be it can be identified using this particular tag and then I want to use bash terminal and it have app.py now if I look for the content of app.py it must have this whole code okay so basically what this piece of code have done it have actually installed",
  "of code have done it have actually installed Python and then after installing python it have set up a working directory and then it have copied whatever was the content of this particular file was there into the Container directory and then it will run this particular command but now the problem is we haven't installed UV right actually we only have installed python we haven't installed UV so that's something that we need to do now okay do we also get some discount on chat CPT uh discount in",
  "also get some discount on chat CPT uh discount in the sense like uh in perplexity we getting one year free so is there any student program with Char I am not aware about that Calton do you have any information about it no I have I I have not heard of any discount program available for uh for us yeah so installing UV use one of the above images with UV preinstalled or install UV by copying the B binary from official dless Docker image and this would copy it from over here I think this would work",
  "copy it from over here I think this would work I guess and you installer or run the installer and then remove it I think these are the things that I need to and ensure the install library is in this particular path okay I think to install UV I think we need to run this piece of code and this is some other version of python so let's just copy this piece of code from here to this stalker container [Music] So within the stalker file we are specifying the python version that it needs to install and",
  "the python version that it needs to install and then it will do a curl and it will try to first update everything and I think this will install curl command and then using curl it will install the script for UV and then it will run this particular script and then it will set the path variable and I think this would now work so I will rebuild coping B so right now what it is doing [Music] sure it is executing each of these command step by step so I think there are eight steps 1 2 3 and then four",
  "I think there are eight steps 1 2 3 and then four and then this is fifth this is sixth this is seventh and then this is eighth and at the end it will just run U run. pi and this have copied okay now let me now it have build the image I will now run that particular image for man run and then TDS hyphen [Music] hello yeah I think it is working it's running the application but we won't be able to interact with that application because because we have to do Port mapping so oh I don't know why it",
  "have to do Port mapping so oh I don't know why it falls how to exit it I started running and installed packages oh it have finished installing packages now okay I don't think we will be able to interact with it yeah it says connection is not found that is because whatever is this dock it is running inside dock so we don't have access to those port numbers outside Docker so we'll need to map those port number and now I will open so this is TDS project page they have mentioned how we can actually",
  "page they have mentioned how we can actually map the port numbers where is p man run yeah this is the one and okay cancelled so here what we are doing we are again running the same image TDS hello and then we are passing the environment variable so here we are passing environment variable from our local system so instead of API prox eii proxy token I'm passing eii proxy and then in Docker container it should be accessed as eii proxy only and now we are giving the port mapping so it will map",
  "now we are giving the port mapping so it will map 8,000 port with the 8,000 Port of my uh WSL okay so now I think we will be able to access it oh okay or run run created field unable to start container process execute file not found underscore path probably have to specify the part like you did in the current directory man run TD and maybe like that no that is to build right okay found in dollar path do we need to put over here [Music] something okay before doing that I can go to the m I think",
  "okay before doing that I can go to the m I think I will leave this ens sure the installed binary is on path do hyph it and then TDS hyphen hello and it should have bash okay and now we have this over here and EO dollar a and sure the installed B is on part for now you could just um export the variable here itself uh but it's sitting in your external environment is it yeah and I think this path is creating an issue I think uh this doesn't look correct to me now it should be path for so see this",
  "to me now it should be path for so see this this have just copied it five or six times I don't know how many times this is same thing but it should be path for this UV right what is you can check does is the which command running you can check which UV on there just type which U see where it is it's already there in the path somewhere there loal bin inside of it it is there is UV um what you can do is uh copy that um error into GPT and see what the reason for that error is this piece of code",
  "the reason for that error is this piece of code yeah yeah and along with Docker file is it no no you can ah yeah well first check what this tells you then we can put the dock this does not seem helpful place before the E and the P options oh is it um okay okay so you have to put the image name afterwards is it uh I'm not sure okay let's try this and let's map it to 8,000 of my machine it's not causing an error now okay yeah so maybe we need to change this thing in Project might be might be yes",
  "this thing in Project might be might be yes it have installed all those packages okay let's open it now I think it will open okay now let me go to order and yes and then it must have q and let's place a order oh internal server error read timeout it uh could be because your doc image is it able to communicate with the outside world uh in the sense it is able to access these port numbers and these things no no no as in can it send see your application is sending a request right oh okay so I okay",
  "is sending a request right oh okay so I okay let me just remove all these parameters as of now and let us check it over here if it yeah it it is able to send it but it is unprocessable entity it's a 422 error I've never seen that one before 422 same I am screenshot I'm taking a screenshot seriously first time I'm seeing this okay neither I don't know about this 422 error code the server understand the content type of the requested request entity and the syntax of the request entity is correct",
  "and the syntax of the request entity is correct but it is enabled content instructions semantic gets in the [Music] request usually the these requests are done by the application and oh now it's working I don't know why classic coding moment it it Miss the fun a monkey just toldo something from me but uh what what did I miss monkey just stole something from you where are [Music] you so what happened what was the error I mean I didn't change anything I just rerun and it worked yeah we are in",
  "I just rerun and it worked yeah we are in this situation that some code doesn't work we do not know why now the code works we do not know why right right I mean the thing is I haven't changed anything so I don't know why it worked earlier why it was failing and now it have worked so it's asking for the confirmation so maybe I should use the prompt that I was earlier using so did Monkey actually steal something yeah yeah did it it just I just can't believe it he was so quiet he came literally",
  "believe it he was so quiet he came literally right next to me and then stole something from me my god oh now it have placed order okay fantastic I think uh I think today's that's it for today's session isn't it um to just circle back on uh Anand you were earlier a little bit confused about the uh bash yeah yeah bash thing right so I'll try and attempt to clear that up for you um just give me one second here and also you could uh just mention was uh why do we use a doer explained uh in an",
  "was uh why do we use a doer explained uh in an earlier session and I can go back and it up just don't get the concept of okay so where is my in my uh okay there we go right so um so yeah I'll explain why what the use case for Docker is so at the moment this is your this is your Windows machine okay and uh how do you interact with this Windows machine like uh U so it's just a yeah it's just a big steel box right so you got two ways to interact with right okay so this will remain the same cartton",
  "right okay so this will remain the same cartton for Mac as well the Mac WSL Docker yeah yeah yeah I mean WSL is not there in Mac but it has okay okay this this this gray this gray area will go off yeah okay so um so you can interact either using the GUI with your machine or you can interact using a a terminal right either one of these two things so when you open up a terminal inside your Windows right the next thing is the question is so you have something else inside your windows in this",
  "have something else inside your windows in this situation it's a virtual machine called uh WSL okay windows for subsystem for Linux it's called so it's effectively another computer a fully fledged computer but the only difference is instead of it being physical it's sharing the resources that are on the physical machine with uh with your windows uh operating system okay so effectively there are uh two operating systems running now inside your machine uh WSL just happens to be inside the windows",
  "uh WSL just happens to be inside the windows environment okay but it's still a virtual machine effectively okay so far you're with me right yes yes yes yes so the next question is how do you interact with the WSL by by reaching out through command line prom or connecting so there is only one way to interact with WSL at the moment uh soon they will introduce something called WSL G but we'll not worry about that for now but at the moment there is only one way to interact with WSL and that is to",
  "only one way to interact with WSL and that is to actually uh use a terminal okay so this terminal will give you uh access to all the programs that are running inside your WSL so when you run VSS code or when you run um a server or any kind of application the only way to interact with it is via this terminal or any services that it provides will be exposed okay I'll put a little whole here okay so services that you run okay so now for example we were using the browser right but that browser is",
  "were using the browser right but that browser is sitting in our Windows machine correct see I shouldn't green color I should probably use red color here okay so you have a browser sitting inside your Windows machine the only reason it's able to read need these um um services from inside your WSL is because a port has been opened up which is over here okay and then your in your browser you put the URL you say Local Host okay and then you say ,000 or something like this right so this Local Host",
  "or something like this right so this Local Host is mapped to your WSL uh uh virtual machine inside okay and then on Port 8,000 it is able to interact with the application because you've told the application use port 8,000 so that's why in the beginning when we were demonstrating the program uh on the browser and it's interacting with WSL it was able to run okay so far you're with me right yes yes yes yes okay so now the next thing is um we now packaged our application instead of being on WSL we",
  "our application instead of being on WSL we packaged it inside a Docker image so you can see this uh orange thing here right that's the applic whoops that's the so this is the application that we created TDS hello yeah okay it's an image inside Docker it's a very lightweight image because it only contains the absolute Bare Bones essential that we require and Docker I won't explain the technology of Docker right now but basically uh takes uh the kernel from WSL in order order to give the",
  "uh the kernel from WSL in order order to give the appearance that this is running inside its own virtual machine but it's not okay kind of image yeah so it takes the resources from WSL but it isolates this uh TDS hello um within an environment so it makes it seem like it's a virtual machine so for our purposes okay because we are not going to give you an exam on this we'll just pretend for now that Docker images are also virtual images okay I mean sorry virtual machines but they are not okay so",
  "sorry virtual machines but they are not okay so don't go out there and say this is a virtual machine it's not but for our understanding purposes you just think of it as another small tiny super efficient virtual machine okay so when you are in the terminal and jbj was showing you the terminal so he was showing you this right so imagine this is the terminal he's operating inside which was in vs code but that vs code was actually using the WSLS terminal okay now he then typed a command saying uh",
  "okay now he then typed a command saying uh um bash bash on here right so what that does is it opens up another terminal okay and that's the bash terminal okay but this bash terminal actually so if I actually change the colors this bash terminal is actually inside this image so it comes back to that same question I was asking how do you interact with the virtual machine sitting inside windows WSL you open up a terminal right so how do you interact with the TS hello virtual machine you open up",
  "with the TS hello virtual machine you open up another terminal so that's why the prompt changed to in order to show you which machine you're interacting with so when you were in WSL it was showing you a particular prompt that said Jr or something like that right but when you opened up the the docker image it gave you a completely different prompt because you're actually interacting with a completely different machine so although the window was the same the changing of the prompt gave you the",
  "the same the changing of the prompt gave you the clue that you're actually interacting with a completely different machine so does that did you understand yes yes yes yes um uh uh the scripts I can uh interpret yeah whatever is necessary so what I understood was like the B thing which he he wrote in the CLI yeah was referring to the the bare bone image of the wsg which is inside the docker kind of instance which we are using like Docker is Docker basically uh is an instance of uh what do you",
  "basically uh is an instance of uh what do you call the uh the instance of for example what we call it as but now we can pretend environment kind of correct because like I have done Docker a long time back when beanie stock like uh Amazon ews was launched yes so that like I'm I just had a hint of cloudfront and all those things okay but haven't used it because it was just uh so so I usually get confused between these two things yeah okay yeah but basically it's a virtual machine sitting inside a",
  "basically it's a virtual machine sitting inside a virtual machine sitting inside a virtual machine okay got it got it and the terminal is how we interact with these virtual machines and the when the prompt changes it gives you Clues you into the fact that you are operating in a different teral now there is a formal way to find out you can actually ask uh in terminal itself there's a command you can give to tell you which machine you're running so that also is possible uh but that's not",
  "so that also is possible uh but that's not necessary for us at this stage uh because that's getting deep into understanding Linux and things of that sort but that's not necessary um so coming back to someone was asking what the use case for um Docker is right so the use case for Docker is if you look at these windows the these boxes I've drawn Windows takes a whole machine to run on right I mean this takes a lot of resources uh WSL is um takes a lot less resources and doesn't take as much but",
  "a lot less resources and doesn't take as much but still takes quite a lot of resour because it's a full-fledged operating system whereas this TDS hello I don't know how many megabytes it was but it was I think maybe no more than say 80 megabytes okay I'm being very generous here it's probably much less than that okay that's all it takes it takes 80 megabytes this Docker image and of course it has to run inside a Docker engine uh which will be sitting on a Surface but the key thing to remember",
  "on a Surface but the key thing to remember is you can have whoops you can have literally thousand no not hundreds thousands you can literally have thousands of independent Docker images running inside your machine whereas you can't have a th000 virtual machines running inside your machine how do we like J started the docker images but how do you he exited the docker image as well but it was still there how do you remove it like it was not the so then there are some so there is a list of",
  "the so then there are some so there is a list of commands if you go to week two of uh the tools in data signs on there there are a list of commands which tell you how to start a Docker image stop a Docker image and how you can remove them as well I think but there are some few basic commands that are there that you uh can use in order to manage your images but rocker images by themselves are relatively safe right they are just like virtual environments yeah they're relatively safe that's why we",
  "yeah they're relatively safe that's why we use them because you can also use them to uh deploy applications anywhere you want so the beauty is now this Docker image he once he pushes it to podman any one of you can download it and use it and you don't even have to worry about what the dependencies are what the system it was created on you don't have to worry if it's Windows Mac Linux nothing matters because it's fully self-contained and you're able to run the application so this is this is the",
  "to run the application so this is this is the use case of Docker you as a developer uh don't have to worry what your customer is running what environment what machine they're running you just give the docker image tag what tag they have to look for they download it on the system and they deploy the application it's the perfect um way to deploy applications at scale and that's the use case of Docker so that's um you know that's it in a nutshell unless you have some other questions thanks so",
  "unless you have some other questions thanks so Docker would be used by multiple developers working together not by the at the user end right only yeah I mean at the user end also you can see a use case for it so let's say for example you you have got a client who you know your uh you want to create a solution for them you can create your solution you can send them the details of how to get Docker on their uh the docker image running on their system and then they can deploy and run it without",
  "and then they can deploy and run it without any problems right so that's possible you don't have they don't have to uh you know you don't have to create a web server in order to run uh some application for them the use use case are much more for Docker in that sense so if say for example it's a small supermarket and they want to run an application but you don't want to recreate an application for each and every Supermarket depending on their equipment right this person is using some",
  "their equipment right this person is using some five-year-old equipment that person is using some um you know MacBook the other person is using a Linux machine from an for an old system it doesn't matter at all you just get the docker image on their system and it just works you know that's the beauty of it right there is no um there is no difficulty in running the application because you're completely insulated from the the difficulties of what they system is of course some resources it will",
  "they system is of course some resources it will use but uh it's very minimal compared to a full-fledged uh applications that are traditionally built applications but it would matter right that if the CPU is uh the virtualization is enabled or not uh it depends on the kind of applications you're building right but uh we have in theory we have built a very powerful application just now I know it doesn't look very powerful but actually it is fairly powerful application but it uses very little",
  "powerful application but it uses very little resources right so the application that was built today um what would be shared with me so for example JRA has built what would he share with me so that I can you know uh use it in my system using Docker how would that work yeah so two things are required first you need to be able to run Docker itself the the green box that I've shown you okay so that should be on your system and then all you have to do is get the pull the image from the repo so your",
  "is get the pull the image from the repo so your client would just need to know what repo to use can we access doer Docker hub using pod man I believe so because they meant to be compatible with each other but sometimes there are some difficulties searching for images from podman but I don't know what the reasons are but uh they are supposed to be inter interactable with each other podman is just supposed to be an open source version of Docker side kind of thing because I don't know if you're",
  "side kind of thing because I don't know if you're aware but Docker has gone to a paid model right seriously okay Docker is no longer open source uh it's uh it's writing in that quasi Zone where uh it's hard to say it is fully open source or not because it's a bit like it's like it's almost like red hat or something yeah it's becoming more like they're using the red hat uh model where if you actually want to use it properly then you have to pay for the uh certain functionality but that's",
  "pay for the uh certain functionality but that's completely then makes it not open source right in the truest sense of the word as long has core features are free that's fine yeah but uh see this is that's the thing they control the uh deployment today say you if your business depends on Docker right uh and if you're building to scale on that and tomorrow if they change the terms this is this is the problem right then you're kind of stuck right yeah then we stuck yeah so this is the this is the",
  "then we stuck yeah so this is the this is the pain Point that's why so for now you're just a student and you're doing small small things it's okay but um you don't want to do small small things forever right you want to uh grow your uh business or if you got a if you want a consultancy firm that is doing it Services you know at some point you will be very invested in whatever technology you decide to deploy so if you go into a paid or partially paid solution now there is no telling when they",
  "paid solution now there is no telling when they can change the terms and conditions but then you're fully uh integrated into the system it's difficult to walk away from it uh this is this is the key problem right so that's where you have to make a make a choice okay I think uh I think that covers everything that we needed to cover for today so [Music] um right uh if there are no more questions we'll end this meeting I hope it was useful for you guys and you got a sense of the workflow of how to",
  "and you got a sense of the workflow of how to create an application deploy it um so that it's uh able to uh use a service like uh a HTTP server and then um package it into Docker and to um be able to use it anywhere and the elements that are shown here is effectively what gets put into project so all the things you learn today is exactly what you'll end up doing in project but on a much larger scale and your project will have to be robust against uh errors so your logic you'll have to code a",
  "uh errors so your logic you'll have to code a bit more carefully than we did today um so that's um that's it for today thank you very helpful now at least I'll try attempting the project I was thinking whether I should be yeah yeah you should really get started on it early okay but uh the good news is now you know the work bits that go together rest is all uh just uh getting the bugs cleared out like we were doing later today so just getting your code very robust there are some few extra things",
  "code very robust there are some few extra things we need to show you actually but that we will show you in some in the next session that comes up because we'll start with project sessions and in these project sessions we will show you something a bit Advanced so project will necessarily require you to uh create um uh code using llm so in other words what happens is you tell llm the issue you're trying to solve llm has to create the code then you have to um run the code if the code creates error",
  "have to um run the code if the code creates error remember this is all happening dynamically okay you are not involved in anything at all this is all automatically happening uh if the code generates an error while running you put it in a feedback loop where you take the code as the context and the error code and the ER and you send it back to the llm to correct its own mistakes and then once it runs successfully it is hopefully giving you the results that project is requiring you to produce so",
  "that project is requiring you to produce so how do you produce this intelligent self-writing program is one aspect that we have not shown you yet but before we can show you that we needed to show you these things because so at least you have a ground foundation on how to do function calling and uh do simple tasks uh using llms in your application that will be great thank you right now I can imagine myself getting into an infinite Loop because that's what happened now so the error keeps on",
  "that's what happened now so the error keeps on coming and we keep on feeding it into the system to understand and I don't know I hope that won't be the case for the project yeah I mean there are ways to mitigate all those things okay there are techniques uh and tips we will share with you how to do it we'll build up in fact what we will do is we will build a project scaffold together and uh you'll be able to then based on that you'll be able to build your project great thanks if while sending",
  "build your project great thanks if while sending the calendar invites if it can be mentioned I don't know if it's already mentioned sorry but um that this is the topic for this session then that'll be great very helpful sir typically we put that in the emails but um yeah we will put that in the calendar as well email should should be fine so if it's already there yeah thank you okay thanks okay thanks everyone uh so last question um not related to this one it's just a generic question which I",
  "to this one it's just a generic question which I wanted to ask U there are few like uh not for everything I should be Consulting you guys because you guys are also uh teaching these things and like there is one flow which shouldn't be broken so what I'm asking is uh for for kind kind of groundw work to be done by me what are all the things because I have gone through the G2 I was able to do some of them but uh like kind of half of kind of situation is over there so in order to build the uh the",
  "is over there so in order to build the uh the fence around the current uh ga3 what are the topics which which I should like go or have a flavor of that if that like if if that can be answered uh uh I mean you all the things we demonstrated today are what you will use in ga3 I mean there is uh a little bit of um if you there was a session I had done I think on Tuesday and there I talked about the basics of and uh of GPT llm calls I don't know if you were present yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm",
  "you were present yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm attending like from next week uh like from next week my offices are like uh will be um like the the people reporting to me will be there in the office so it's like I also needs to be there so sure sure I was able to avoid till this time but like now I have to be there so till the till the time like the the thing is like till the time I'm attending each and every session of yours yeah the yeah so the um session on Tuesday covered um L how to make",
  "um session on Tuesday covered um L how to make llm uh calls and the structure of the body um and also it I talked a in that I talked a little bit about tokens and I think in later session they talked about embeddings so tokens embeddings how to uh do image URI and coding uh no actually was that required in in uh like he has demonstrated that the image en coding where where where the dot product of the two yes yes yeah yeah so all these sorts of things what's generally required in ga3 so you",
  "of things what's generally required in ga3 so you should be able to answer most if not all the questions okay okay okay okay okay thank you and with support of you I think we can move only thing we haven't dealt with in depth was something called prompt engineering but there's a very good video on that on the site itself right so just watch that and there's some text also there which is worth reading about prompt engineering so just go through prompt engineering we haven't dwelt on it",
  "through prompt engineering we haven't dwelt on it extensively but if you just read up that material there's one question that deals with prompt engineering I think it's the 10th question or something the last question where you have to get the llm to say yes so yes Caron I came back here for asking about that thing only yeah C I'm I've been trying to get it to say yes for the last two hours now but it it does is not willing to discuss anything simply asked it a question whether it is an AI or",
  "simply asked it a question whether it is an AI or not and it replied I'm not inclined to discuss that also M did you um try looking on past discour uh uh post I mean I've been trying to just do it myself I'm not even trying to get GPD to help me right right so yeah I mean what can I say it's you got to I can't say anything other than you have to use prompt engineering because that's effectively a prompt engineering exercise so what did you say that you're not using GPT for something or is the",
  "that you're not using GPT for something or is the question for me or no no no foras or whoever was sorry can you repeat the question so what were you saying about not using GPT for certain task not certain task in the last question the uh thing that we have to essentially do is they have given us an AI model which have been put under the Restriction that it cannot in any condition say yes and we as a prompt engineer are testing that in this hypothetical situation we need to give it a prompt",
  "situation we need to give it a prompt that somehow forces it or finishes it to just say yes yeah I mean it's something that we asked in Roe but there were many there were several successful attempts right I'll end the recording now",

  "showing uh some things like I might have it no uh sorry I don't have that right now but I don't know why I'm not getting that this time okay so regarding this problem that you are facing with post so actually whenever you try to uh access a URL from browser it will send a get request so if you want to send an post request you would need to install some extension like um Thunder client and then the other one is Postman Postman and or thunder c one of them so if you just go to the extensions tab",
  "of them so if you just go to the extensions tab okay and over here search for Postman or thunder yeah this is the one I think if you install tender client then you won't have to sign in anywhere but here you would have to create a account so is paid now th is paid now I oh is it yes they have recently changed okay okay I'm using free version I don't know how uh when did they change is it some one or two recently okay okay you can okay the client I've installed it is not showing any pay",
  "client I've installed it is not showing any pay something oh okay okay uh if you don't know [Music] uh AR yes sir I'll just go back to extensions D tab okay yeah over there search for trender client I think that doesn't require you to install I mean do any authentication and those things let done I think sir can you tell me spelling TS and d r come again d h u n d e r Thunder client is paid now but it is it has some basic stuff free but oh is it still some stuff is free but like if you can only",
  "still some stuff is free but like if you can only make 15 Collections and or something sorry three Collections and do 15 request is this yeah this is the one 15 request per okay three collections or something okay we can just have own documentation for this I don't know like why they're charging but it's okay earlier they don't use to charge okay uh so you see that Thunder icon just below the postman icon just click over there and click on new request button request button and over here is",
  "request button request button and over here is instead of get select [Music] Post Yeah and in the URL instead of https www tender.com you you can use the uh local post address just copy it from the browser so what we are doing over here basically uh whenever we send a request so for3 question seven and 8 we need to send a post request right but whenever you try to uh to try to access any URL through your browser it will actually send a get request so now if you use Cent and these things then",
  "so now if you use Cent and these things then you will be able to sendest just click on cancel okay that is because the server is not running Okay now click on send button okay 4 two sir after uh making get to post what we have to do actually I'm also follow of that uh which you are saying uh wait uh can you uh can you go to body okay body body body in itself okay okay wait yeah uh just click on body Hiers authentication body yeah and you pull this down yeah yeah pull it down and over here",
  "this down yeah yeah pull it down and over here create a Json object create a Jon object how do you do that uh put curly braces okay yeah yeah and then you put uh so can you go back to question seven uh question seven question seven sir this is okay from on Portal okay okay yes sir yeah yeah just uh scroll a bit up so here in the example you can see how you want to send it object so just copy this part yeah just copy this yeah and paste it there and now remove those three dots Okay click on send",
  "now remove those three dots Okay click on send button okay now you can uh have a look at the um error in the console the API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by set the open a key environment variable so are you trying to access open a key yes sir okay can you show that code and is it available in uh get EnV I think it fetches from a file so is there any file. EnV or something uh no sir okay so you would have to create that file that's why it is getting",
  "have to create that file that's why it is getting this error okay sir okay sir I will do that that yeah so instead of that for now what you can do you can just comment whole code that is after 172 okay line number 172 yes sir and now commment this whole code till where this function ends till this function ends okay and now on line number 172 you just write return hello or something something simple return and you put this hello in inside codes yeah just save it and send one request okay can",
  "yeah just save it and send one request okay can you rerun the server [Music] okay yeah just click on send button again that is okay just go back to question 7py now over here comment the line where you are trying to access open a token no not here uh a the place where you have defined open a key yeah this is the one line number 149 just comment it okay now try to send one request H that is okay so you would have to restart server okay did you save uh question 7.5 yes sir I have saved it okay um",
  "uh question 7.5 yes sir I have saved it okay um can you show me the whole error open I the AP option must be set either um by passing this or by doing that can can can you show your code question 7p okay okay okay that is because what you are trying to do um wait a second so you are trying to send an request using openi modle python module right yes sir but you won't be able to do that so the way you send a request is through un proxy I see actually I tried that also but in that also it was",

  "uh environment variable and these things then the actual requesting part is it in this one yeah this is the one so actually you send an request using request module that is present in Python and then you send a post request to this particular URL and do then you also Define headers which has the information about your authentication token and then you pass the actual Json body so this is how you will be sending a request to open not use uh don't use import open module or something like that uh",
  "use import open module or something like that uh I know yes sir so did you understand how you have to send request to open yes sir yes sir I got it so just use this request module and then you pass it like this okay sir okay um thank you sir and let me have a look at something okay what I was talking about let me create one more file over here and that is [Applause] okay here I will just ask for a basic uh fast API application give me code for a basic fast API application also add course to it",
  "basic fast API application also add course to it and write one and write some code for post request okay and now I will need to import not import I will need to get these things over here and then I will need to put fast API sir uh sorry to interrupt but I have to leave for some urgent work uh can uh can I uh ask you for the email ID for so just I can uh connect you with the queries okay you can actually create a discourse post yes sir I Al I have clear created the discourse post but uh you",
  "have clear created the discourse post but uh you have uh okay maybe what I will do after the session I will create some code that that runs a fast API application and then I will try to send one one or two request some post request or some put request and uh using Thunder client and maybe we can also use Cur or something that I I will check and then I will create a video and then maybe we'll upload it on YouTube or I will upload it on drive or some somewhere and then we'll share it okay okay",
  "some somewhere and then we'll share it okay okay sir uh okay sir thank you sir uh I I'll take your leave sir thank you sir okay [Music] uh so over here instead of all this I can just remove this stuff from here I can even remove this thing and let me just remove this piece of cod and let's call it even and let's just return hello and let me try to run this application okay I will have to use unor [Music] and ptic I don't think we have actually used it so maybe I will just remove it because we",
  "used it so maybe I will just remove it because we have already remove that piece of code and yeah so over here we are serving an application which have post method on this particular endpoint now I will try to hit this particular endpoint with a post request okay so I will first install Thunder client d h [Music] r and now I will send in new request one one thing J uh after that uh code line number 19 20 2123 so so those what what will go in those brackets over here right yeah so this is to",
  "those brackets over here right yeah so this is to allow request from some other external servers so let us say if you are sending if you're submitting URL to this particular assignment then this server is trying to access uh your Local Host so you can mention those servers over there so if I just copy this from here and then I just paste here then this uh the request can come from this particular external server but uh it won't be able to request from calendar.com and these things so this is",
  "from calendar.com and these things so this is just to uh prevent request so instead of this if we just say star then anyone can uh access this application so they they can request from other uh servers but we can actually restrict by a list in those servers so let us say this is the one that we are allowing to access then let us say we also allow to access G2 and I think this is not the correct way we just need to mention the domain and then it will have [Music] access h did you understand one",
  "will have [Music] access h did you understand one thing is there like uh so so the sole purpose of that one is to allowing other persons to access the app which you have made yeah yeah and if we will put star anyone can access it from anywhere yeah yeah and over here you can decide Define the function so like you can yeah so uh now let us say if you put uh some this particular domain over here and you you are listing these two functions get and post then these are the only two functions that",
  "post then these are the only two functions that will be accessible uh by this server and this will be your server for example so this can be any server you can uh it can be any server but on this Local Host If This Server tries to send a request then only that request will uh be a valid request if some other server tries to access data of Local Host then it won't be able to do that so so this allow or origin will be uh uh you have to mention the the the domain name of of that place from where",
  "the the domain name of of that place from where you are trying to access that data is that correct uh yeah and uh allow methods will be these two two things will be your um what you will be using over here get and post no no these are the I mean I can have multiple methods I can have get post I can even have put but these are the two methods that will be accessible from this server MH so if there is some uh method that uses post put request then it won't have access to that uh that particular",
  "it won't have access to that uh that particular method because we are restricting it to have access to get how come when you are how come when you are trying to reach out like you are taking the data from other server how you restricting the like how you are fixing the credential on their behalf so in headers we get the information about from where this particular request is coming and in header we can actually so if this request is coming through this server then in request headers we get the",
  "this server then in request headers we get the information about where this request is coming from and then we also get the information about is it a post request or is it aest one thing one thing one thing so allow origin is is some uh like domain name of some other person okay okay allow can be domain name or it can even be some private IP address IP address and allow method will be what you are trying to do with that particular data with that source uh no see if there are multiple methods",
  "source uh no see if there are multiple methods like if there is one more method let us say that is put method okay and let us say this is your put method then if you try to access so if you send a put request through this server to my local host then you won't be able to do that and that is because I'm only allowing you to use these two methods M and now let us say if I just remove post as well now you won't be having access to post method that is there so if some external server tries to send",
  "is there so if some external server tries to send a post request then it this that request won't be a valid request my server won't generate a valid response so it won't uh run execute this particular piece of code whatever is there so this allow region will be the IP address where you will be hosting your app if I'm getting it correct or anything or uh any Source it can be anything uh so right now where have we hosted this application we are actually running it on our local machine right mhm",
  "running it on our local machine right mhm on 127 when we are trying to reach out to this particular server we will be able to uh uh uh use those only two methods which we are mentioning over there get and post if and that to from this particular server only okay yeah so if this server sends get request to my local host then it will get a valid response but if somebody else sends a get request uh to my local host then it it won't allow um it it won't send a valid response to that particular",
  "it won't send a valid response to that particular server so this is just a this is for security purpose this defines who all can access your um server so let basically uh who all will be able to send requests to your server and which all type of request you are allowing them to send so are the Tag name H1 H2 those things allow hiters the one which you have mentioned in Star H1 where is H1 no no no I'm asking does like does that does that mean H1 and H2 or does that mean something else allow",
  "H1 and H2 or does that mean something else allow headers allow headers no no that is not H1 and H2 so basically uh the so see on network level if you send request there are multiple things that uh gets passed so if I just show you one of the request let me go to discords and let me get this console this network tab over here if you look at one of these requests so here this is response headers but there is something called request header so all these information gets sent to uh to to the server",
  "information gets sent to uh to to the server where we are trying to send a request so we are trying to reach This Server okay and then these are the information that will be sent [Music] in header so it is so if if you say allow headers as a star that means we are allowing any headers so in header it can be anything it can be a cookie or some other kind of authentication if it is a token so there are multiple ways to authenticate something okay um JJ sorry to interrupt uh yeah yeah I was late",
  "um JJ sorry to interrupt uh yeah yeah I was late and I would like to know what exactly are we doing today uh so basically right now I was showing how you can send a request okay thund client now needs this okay let me download the free version and let me install it and I think now I will be able to send request no no no I meant are we doing graded assignments or are we doing project related work so I I was trying to send a post request to this particular endpoint that I have created so there",
  "particular endpoint that I have created so there are multiple uh methods for example get is one then post is another method so was trying to send so whenever you try to access some URL from browser then it will send get request so I was sending a post request for that I need this thund client that is something is not working at the moment okay I will create an recorded video and then I will upload it to YouTube or some or I will just upload it to drive I'm really angry at Thunder C it is really",
  "drive I'm really angry at Thunder C it is really just a rapper for a simple command they're charging $36 H yeah they are now charging $16 right is there no alternative to thunder cland for this purposes I'm trying to build a extension maybe I'll share that with you okay so how many of you have started doing project hello uh yeah I I haven't personally I was going to ask about that I would like to know like when are the sessions planned for the demonstration of the last semeer project I believe",
  "of the last semeer project I believe yeah it is related to project two of last semester so like uh without some kind of example it's kind of hard to just know where to start off and like H sure okay is my screen visible yes yes it is so this is Project one page and then over here you need to create two endpoints one is back SL run and then the other one is back slash read so over here when you were trying to run some task it will have some task description for example on so if we have so first",
  "description for example on so if we have so first you you will have to get data from this particular URL so the way to get data is so you run u v run and then the path to this script and then you append Your Role number over here you can use Postman or just call directly yeah you can do it so this is how you can get the data into your system once you get this data actually we want we okay I have already got the data so this is something that we can use to get data but after you get the data",
  "we can use to get data but after you get the data then it will create these files inside your local system okay and then now if you look at the task A2 so that requires us to format this particular uh file using prettier uh 3 this some version uh so this particular task we have already done in ga1 so we had a markdown file and then we used prer to format it so that is exactly what we have to do so right now we have this file and we need to format it using PR and then yeah if I speak in the top",
  "it using PR and then yeah if I speak in the top of that section it is saying that we need to automate that by automation does not mean uh we have to write a script that will essentially just do everything that's written here by itself if someone else is running it yes exactly we have to I think we have to use the llm to make it use these commands like we ask it to do uh A1 or A2 and the llm will carry it out or we have to write a script to carry these outs so so you are correct you will have to",
  "these outs so so you are correct you will have to use llm so actually see for task three it can be and any one of these so for example it can be so task can come like this the file this is the name of the file that contains list of dates and then one per line and then you would need to count number of fness days and then you write out uh to this particular file so this is task in English English and then you can get the same task in Hindi um okay so for that you will have to use llm or and that",
  "so for that you will have to use llm or and that would get you so that that will maybe it will write some fun code or it can use function calling so I will just demonstrate that part you you will actually have to automate it using LM itself so this is what we have and now okay uh this is something that so we have this sub process module what that allows to do can anyone explain me what what is use of sub module if somebody knows about it sorry use of what sub subprocess module oh uh anyone",
  "use of what sub subprocess module oh uh anyone aware about that okay so what subprocess will allow us to do let us say we want to execute a command for example this particular command this UV run and then the path of this particular script and then we we are passing a role number as argument so actually you we can even run this piece of command using subprocess module in Python so I will just use that first because that is something we need to do okay so I will create one file and now I will",
  "do okay so I will create one file and now I will import sub process and let's execute one sub process run and let's have a look at the uh this is one format so let me use npx and then let me use this stuff and instead of writing it out okay we can write it out and let me change the name of this particular file um let's keep it instead of having this heavy code I will just keep something very simple so we'll keep UV and then we'll use run and then maybe we can say hello world dop and let us see",
  "maybe we can say hello world dop and let us see what this does so I will create one hello world. P file and that will just print hello world okay so can anyone guess what what will happen if I execute this script 1py uh anyone have any idea what will happen if I execute this script 1. y okay okay what are you doing subprocess yeah I'm trying to use run a subprocess so I have created this file which if I execute this particular file it will just print hello world right so wouldn't that sub",
  "just print hello world right so wouldn't that sub process thing it is like because it is called sub process shouldn't it just run the hello world. Pi using that UV run command okay but then how would you run that from terminal right huh from this terminal but let us say I want to run it from a python script you can just do that uh plus sign plus sign the play play sign play play sign this particular symbol uhuh run p no no no no no no what I want to do I have this particular script and I want",
  "to do I have this particular script and I want to execute that script from 1. PI so is it possible like if I go over here and then if I hit this run button then it will work but I what I want to do I want to execute this hellow world. P from 1. PI okay why it is useful for example in G in this project we will have to um write a generic code right so for example how many Wes are there and same can come as an Hindi prompt right so for that we'll have to understand that prompt and then maybe we'll",
  "to understand that prompt and then maybe we'll ask llm to write code but whatever code llm would write we will have to execute that piece of code on our local machine so the way to do that is we get the code from llm and then we save that code in some file and then we execute that file using sub process so all that happens while running the main script oh did you get idea why we need to do this which question is this uh this is not related to question it is related to project okay okay okay",
  "question it is related to project okay okay okay yeah so in project uh C over here you you can get any so these are the 10 tasks that are there but then uh you can get uh some other task as well so developer will call this particular endpoint uh with a task description similar but not identical to the one listed above so they were they will be similar but they won't be um exactly same and there might be some new prompt itself so there can be some some task that is not listed here so now I'm",
  "some some task that is not listed here so now I'm trying to execute hello world. using 1p file and I will execute that file okay now it prints hello world but this particular f. 5 file it doesn't have Hello World in it right that is because it have executed hello world. Pi file from 1. P file okay and now let me do something more complex let me send a request to llm and then we'll ask llm to write some code okay so I will Define a URL that URL will be okay let me just copy this piece of code",
  "will be okay let me just copy this piece of code from here and I will paste it here and then in Json body I will remove these two things because I don't want to do any function call and in content I will say write python code for summing two numbers and uh we will have to create a function uh let's functions and this is the function will have a name so WR underscore code will be the name and then description write code for the given task and now we need parameters for that particular function",
  "we need parameters for that particular function and parameters will be of type object and the task instead of task what I want uh we want llm to write code for us right so let me change it to uh code [Music] code required to complete the task and now let me say so this is our code and then I will need to get the Json from this file so I use this [Music] one and let me just print response. Json okay open it token is not defined so I will need to Define that I will unshare my screen and then I",
  "Define that I will unshare my screen and then I will get my token or I can get this token from here itself I I will just unshare my screen and then I will get back okay so now I have defined this AI proxy token over here and then now let's send the request okay invalid param and let's have a look at this missing parameter and we type parameter zero missing required parameter monthly cost this to of zero [Music] tools so tools is this functions and then okay let me GPD the indicates that type",
  "and then okay let me GPD the indicates that type field is missing from the okay it's type should be function got it run it let me use [Music] this um hello hi hi um like when is the doubt session open or can we ask doubts now if okay um yeah you can ask that okay yeah yeah the first thing is actually like U on that um week three assessment earlier week one and week two used to have yes or no box week three doesn't have yes or no box at all uh so yeah that that is okay there won't be any problem",
  "yeah that that is okay there won't be any problem with that okay uh so actually and one more thing is like can you see my desktop yeah yeah it isible okay so this week three right actually like every I I do not know if it's a race condition or what actually like uh like within a minute only like actually for the same score uh it changed and then it came back so it'll pick the latest right or should I again try to resubmit again all these things uh it will pick the latest so this is the latest",
  "uh it will pick the latest so this is the latest right yeah okay and uh regarding the um uh lab uh yeah project thing this task description is actually like it'll take the ID of this or like what will it take uh it will TT it will take text prompt text prompt meaning uh so it executes a plain English task so if you scroll down uhuh it will execute install UV if required until so it will take like this yeah yeah so this is rest AP post call and we have to pass this string isn't okay so if it's a",
  "have to pass this string isn't okay so if it's a if if F case and if we pass this then we do this uh task is that is that how it is uh yeah okay and uh like where are the contents of these things like uh so that is something if you uh read first task it requires you to download a few files so this GitHub URL right oh this one data gen. Pi so you would have to execute this particular file using UV and then you can the data will get generated okay for all this it will get generated you're saying",
  "for all this it will get generated you're saying yeah okay okay good okay thank you and uh uh okay so for here also like what will be the description like here this this whole thing will be the yeah all these three lines all these three lines will come as the description as the request parameters yeah yeah okay can't it be easier to just pass in the ID like like this whole string will come it okay that is because there might be some other task that it needs to do apart from these predefined",
  "that it needs to do apart from these predefined tasks what does it mean like so if you read the line below uh what you have selected right now developers will call the Run uh task and point with a task description similar to the ones listed above right and for example task A3 okay if you look at the task A3 that requires you to count number of W days right yeah so it can be the prompt can come in English or Hindi or in uru in multiple languages it can come so all that you need to handle so",
  "it can come so all that you need to handle so that's why we we are not using where is the language here uh Hindi uru just to scroll a bit down down okay yeah so over here data content uh SL log that thing oh oh okay okay so it can come like this or it can come like this okay okay okay equivalent sentences in multi language uh those are the input parameters okay okay but it'll have only those three sentences it can be language independent that's what it means right no no it can be different in",
  "what it means right no no it can be different in terms of uh uh English or it can be a slightly different question as well instead of counting wetness days it can ask you to count um need a pass there is it actually like it should pass this content it's not like exactly this okay it should pass this you're saying is that true yeah oh okay okay okay okay uh yeah then then what is this about so that is about see there will be few new task which are not um ex executed earlier so if you read B1",
  "are not um ex executed earlier so if you read B1 uhuh so uh oh okay this is regarding this is regarding um so B1 is you should not delete any file even ask ask for I mean it is regarding something should not get deleted and then so these are the tasks so what are the trigger points like actually here at least there's a rest API there's a post call and then there's a get method actually like these are the two things which they said what are the trigger points here uh it is same trigger point",
  "trigger points here uh it is same trigger point write an API end point that filters CSV file and returns Chas dat so for here the task what is the parameter like fetch the data I'm sorry can you give an example fetch data from API and save it what does this mean so you have some uh okay uh is my screen visible to you oh yeah yeah sorry yeah where is your screen no not anymore not anymore okay is it visible now sorry can you please hear it again yeah it is okay yeah thank you so if we go over",
  "yeah it is okay yeah thank you so if we go over here and then let us see we go here this is week four right oh yeah this is week four okay rather I will use discourse example so here if I go to network Tab and now if I go to user page so here it sends some Epi call to this particular endpoint and then in response it gets this uh this as a response okay so it uses this particular URL and then it sends using these cookies right so over here also it needs to send uh request to some API and then uh",
  "needs to send uh request to some API and then uh it needs to fetch the data and then whatever data it fetches it needs to save somewhere so right now it is so here it is the request is going via Network tab but it should go from your script and then whatever response so this is response so this response needs to be saved in a file okay now fet a data from an API means what will be the URI like can you give me an example uh it can be any URI it can be example the input parameter is a URI sir no",
  "be example the input parameter is a URI sir no there won't be any input parameter kind of thing then where will it fetch the data from uh actually it won't fetch data so what it will do it will compare your code so whatever code you will write okay uh so there there is way like if there is some code which requires you to send some API call then it can I mean we will compare your script using some llm calls so we don't have to code for this you're saying actually like this is done by you is it",
  "saying actually like this is done by you is it or uh like uh means the like what what is the ask here like what should we do here like I'm not still understanding please can you explain hello um jaaj your voice is not Audible anybody here attempted it actually like anybody any guys have an idea on the first project yeah sorry even I have not so do you guys have any [Music] idea um oh yeah yeah okay regarding this uh B part at Phase B yeah we'll get back to it by tomorrow okay okay so does it",
  "get back to it by tomorrow okay okay so does it require to send call to a particular URL or not that I will conf confirm by tomorrow yeah just uh actually if you have U what's the input Json what's the output response Json or something like that some kind of format uh it would be easy actually like this is two generic at least the first one is little bit clear uh the second one is um yeah um and first one is giving instruction on what to and do the first one is giving instruction on what to do",
  "the first one is giving instruction on what to do and how to do it the second one is like vague if really vague on what to yeah it's very big yeah yeah even I concur on that but the uh deliverables are clear actually can you just go to the third part I go to the deliver section so uh here we are supposed to create the docker image push it and then you need only two artifacts one is the get repo the second artifact is the docker image that's it right actually and then we just build it and then",
  "right actually and then we just build it and then expose it is that true and this should be a public repository yeah I think I I hope so yeah should be okay yeah um this is clear and then come down actually like U yeah so we are expected to use only this gpta 40 okay so this is clear only the second one is like not good enough okay okay I will get back on that that would be great um and um yeah can you please go up actually like um those parameters comes in part of the body right actually all",
  "comes in part of the body right actually all those in the post body uh which parameter are you talking about no no this uh input like actually these three strings which you talked about thep description mhm yeah that comes as part of the post parameter or like actually in the body or is it coming in the in the body in the body in the body then what is that question mark equal to because there is a equal to it seems like it is a query parameter not a body parameter that is a query parameter",
  "not a body parameter that is a query parameter right task equal to okay okay we'll correct that no no what is expected which one are you expecting it in the body okay so you want it in a body but I I but I will confirm it by tomorrow okay okay does it mean that excuse me J sorry sorry sorry but like in this post thing uh by the task description does it mean that we have to put in A1 A2 like that or is it going to put in a string of what it wants and we are supposed he doesn't want an ID uh um",
  "and we are supposed he doesn't want an ID uh um Bisal he wants the string and that string can be in any language he has given three descriptions if you come to A3 yeah please go here yes this is the format it can be any one of the format and it can mean different also so that's what is the expectation yeah okay so it's not like we're going to get an ID no no it would have been easier but I think they want some kind of a parer and also like kind of a language translator uh so from that we can",
  "of a language translator uh so from that we can deduce actually and then discover what are the subtasks and and then based on that actually we have some uh conditional logic and actually go to different blocks and then execute this 10 or I don't know 10 or eight or nine segments actually I think that's the expectation yeah please can you revert back quickly uh I I didn't check this because there were other tasks in other courses and projects so I'm sorry for reverting back later but um L if you",
  "sorry for reverting back later but um L if you can get back tomorrow it would be great yeah thank you yeah thank you man thank you sorry for the interruption also J I had a doubt about the tokens that we have given for the a proxy okay what is your doubt regarding that I I'm sure I clearly heard cartton sir say that we have a limit of one USD but when I go to the website uh like the G report where we get the link to check our uh AI proxy token and how much limit we have already crossed it is",
  "and how much limit we have already crossed it is clearly saying that I have a monthly limit of $0.5 so I'm like I want to know which one is the correct one no you can use it uh bis I've used it like more than 100 times you can use it actually you can can use it like anything actually okay it won't limit you you just use it no there a limit yeah just to clarify yeah officially it is $1 per month yeah but Caron I think you can use it more right actually even the I I thought actually like laugh 27",
  "even the I I thought actually like laugh 27 28 29 actually I used it a lot actually but still I didn't complain much actually it says like used is 0123 yeah I mean the number of users is okay but the total amount yeah is uh is $1 per student per month yeah and I think it's very hard to cross that actually like based on the cost no no it's uh it's very easy to cross if your code is not efficient okay okay like that then we have had students in the past who have crossed the limit very easily",
  "the past who have crossed the limit very easily because they've written very poorly written codes so they use up their allowance very rapidly okay that's a good criteria okay yeah thank you I mean I Carlton at one point said that we have to be like especially careful when uh constructing the code also to make sure that we're not inefficiently using aart tokens I mean the other thing I would say is in case you run out of uh credits just get in touch with us and uh we can make some adjustments",
  "touch with us and uh we can make some adjustments okay but uh generally speaking official limit is $1 okay also JJ I mean there is we four coming up we also have to get the project started so i' like do we have some kind of uh time frame on what to do and when to do you're talking about official time frame not exactly official like uh in the next uh session I guess what will we be talking about like will it be G4 or will it be project I me asking which one will get prioritized more right now",
  "which one will get prioritized more right now that we'll have to decide I think we'll give more priority to project one I think also uh jaaj I know this is a weig question uh in ga3 the base 64 and like we changed the image into a base 64 mhm I did that myself using a python code I got a base 64 URL I mean the image was converted into the text and I thought it was working uh like I thought it was the correct one but uh I think the B 64 was wrong because the UI and the G3 said it was wrong then",
  "because the UI and the G3 said it was wrong then I find out another method to get the B 64 I'm asking is how do we get the base 64 our CS by using a script or something and how do we know that it's the correct one okay [Music] um I I can show the code that I use I can show the Bas that I got uh is my screen visible to you uh yes yes R so whatever encoding you have got if you paste over here for example I will past my encoding that is question number for Cross [Music] it okay it's not available",
  "for Cross [Music] it okay it's not available over here yeah that's also another thing I noticed all the not all the answers but some of the answers just vanish if we like log off from the website some remains but some [Music] vanish okay also in the previous assignments which we have already submitted can the check uh the answer button still be enabled like do not obviously enable save but uh because if we can check the answers we can kind of attempt and do that yeah like new more efficient",
  "attempt and do that yeah like new more efficient methods that we have discovered as we go on okay we'll discuss about this with an okay J's question related to this B 64 part can one image have multiple different iterations of b64 it same it will be same be same then I need to check okay so if if you pasted that B 64 over here okay whatever that is and then it will show you uh that exact the real image so this was the image that was there and if I download this image and let me save it now if I",
  "I download this image and let me save it now if I open this image it is this image okay if I go here and if I look for its properties its size and these things so it comes out to be 2.40 KB right and now if I compare its size over here it is same size and even its resolution will be same so if see uh the encoding is correct then if you paste in this particular decoder then uh you would get the same image and then you can even compare it by the size of image and and you can encode the image by",
  "size of image and and you can encode the image by the their encoder as well so if you just go over here and then if you select file from local machine and now if I encode it I'm getting this encoding and then from here you can copy this encoding so this is how I have done question four I have copy pasted encoding from here itself again I'm checking my own Corde now I see that the B 64 I got from the both the methods are same but I don't understand why the b64 I got from my script was not",
  "why the b64 I got from my script was not working while this new method worked instantaneously uh if you want you can share your screen uh no I mean I think I'll see it myself I'm sorry also uh I'm sure it is not allowed but can you give some hints about what prompts I should write to make the AI in the question n just say yes because I have created stories trying to get the AI to say yes and it's not working [Music] okay uh regarding that question and which is related to B 64 URL you can paste",
  "and which is related to B 64 URL you can paste that the encoding that you already have in the decoder and then you can actually visually compare both those images the actual one and the encoded one no no in question n the question n was we have to write up a string that is going to make an AI which was like commanded or like programmed not to say yes and get him to say yes I mean just make him go that is something you will have to think about it and then you will have to do it on your own I",
  "it and then you will have to do it on your own I don't like I not attempted it but usually these kind of prompts you just have to be very like just just just try to fool fool but like not if I if I say something more I the okay I guess thank you thank you for helping I mean one thing you could do is look up whole discourse posts because they had the same question in Roe last that is nice there are lots of suggestions on there for people who managed to successfully do it so that will give you a",
  "to successfully do it so that will give you a what you put thank you for that Caron I'll check it out okay does anyone else have any questions very has a session ended or something no because no one has any doubts we sitting here okay so I uh see I I have not attempted G3 to be honest I am going to do that but G2 I attempted obviously the deadline has passed but I got stuck in this Docker p man question I'll probably attempt it again so that was I was saying that if I can check the answer that",
  "I was saying that if I can check the answer that would be spended even if I if I can ask I mean you got stuck means like can you elaborate like uh I actually ended up installing Docker then I tried solving it with Docker then I installed bband then I was like I got stuck with something okay R maybe you can share your screen and exactly explain what you are trying to do that uh I'm not sure if I I mean the deadline is passed question gone so I don't think he can exactly show what he was trying",
  "think he can exactly show what he was trying to do uh yes but I mean do you have the files I don't know like I I just uh first was trying to run something but then I'm not sure if it is where is that yeah so yes so I have to add this tag right to the docker thing but it was not happening it was just showing me this not exist locally with tag this then I was trying to create it right then it was still not happening can you see it like Docker push first container mhm then I was I something it was",
  "first container mhm then I was I something it was [Music] doing request this second of resources denied or something then I did doer push doer this but this also did not nothing happen then then I Tred to push with the tag that if if somehow it works but it did not work so then later on I installed pod man but then the deadline was very close and like I I definitely going to give the full dat tomorrow to the assignment instead of giving five hours so that definitely not uh J like I don't I",
  "hours so that definitely not uh J like I don't I don't exactly remember how I did this but I just wanted to ask do we have to do this using the command prompt or is there some way to just do it from the website because I think I never opened the command prompt in doing that question seriously huh I seriously don't remember but I'm sure I did not use command prompt anywhere I use the website mostly or something okay which website did you use I used Docker and Docker I opened an account and I did",
  "Docker and Docker I opened an account and I did something but I can't remember what I did that looks like a very simple thing to do and stupid maybe uh you use Docker desktop yes I downloaded the app and I did not even see I downloaded it how do you do it using do Tex maybe just try once I have to see the question again for the life of me I can't remember what I okay I I'll try doing it myself first like the deadline has passed no point discussing it right now I'll just do the other stuff first",
  "it right now I'll just do the other stuff first and we can I can ask later if I get stuck I just gave myself five hours to the assignment which was very enough usually five hours is not enough for me like I have I've been doing these assignments for days on end especially G2 for some reason took lots of my times for some reason especially the last questions of uh like uh running the local server on a different API the engro thing no yes yes no no not engr thing the fast API thing fast question",
  "not engr thing the fast API thing fast question I was also not able to do because of the time finishing I did eight questions uh but the last two at the end of it I got everything I mean I got full marks everything was fine but uh I distinctly remember fast API was somehow that was the most problematic thing to solve for me because lot of different things were happening en gr was easy yeah there was a hiccup Caron sir if you can remember I just deleted my system path variables and installing",
  "deleted my system path variables and installing and GR but that was my own [Music] foolishness you try that question and then I I will try to record a video and then we'll I will upload it on G maybe I will post it uh on this course okay okay I'll follow can you also make uh small recap for how to do the fast API questions from the G2 okay thank you okay so if the session is over uh maybe I'll take your leave as well also J I think you should stop recording I mean nothing much is happening",
  "stop recording I mean nothing much is happening right now st stop Rec",

  "all right ladies and gentlemen we are going to start with our new live session and in this live session we'll be going to start we starting with the G4 okay so again one thing that you will notice in this G is that things have you know smooth out smooth out a bit okay so a trajectory of you know hard to easy it's going you know it's moving to towards easiness okay so this G is pretty easy for you uh as compared to the previous GS okay so this will be much more lighter on you with that respect",
  "be much more lighter on you with that respect okay by the way are uh is my voice uh is is it low or is it perfectly fine it is good all right let's go ahead and now so we will be starting with this first question and uh here we are going to know how to extract H to extract a table from HTML okay using Google Sheets so this functionality is available in Google Sheets if you try to use this function in Excel you won't be able to okay it will give you it will give you a name error and will just",
  "you it will give you a name error and will just end the story right there okay so this functionality is not available in Excel if I'm not wrong perhaps you require a few plugins and uh uh some more things to you know actually make Excel capable of doing this stuff but at the moment if you have a normal vanilla let's say vanilla Microsoft Excel you won't be able to access this okay so this is only available exclusively towards Microsoft towards Google Sheets okay so uh okay so what are we going",
  "Sheets okay so uh okay so what are we going to do is obviously I won't be showing you guys how to extract data from this ODI bat chats uh web page but what I will be showing you is this okay so this is my anime list and this is the top ranking of the top animes so if you're wondering what are animes so these are just Japanese animations uh and believe me they are pretty good so uh so being an anime fan I will be taking this example okay so over here we have just like in IMDb website we are able",
  "we have just like in IMDb website we are able to see that we have multiple animes listed in a table right here okay so let's see if we can access the data set this entire table in our Google page or not in a Google sheet or not okay let's check this and uh uh I'll be honest I haven't tried it yet to you know actually access this particular table let's try it our okay so I'll be trying it with you guys okay so let's go ahead and write the import HTML function so HTML function and as soon as you",
  "HTML function so HTML function and as soon as you open this this bracket you will be able to see that he require four parameters so one parameter is URL is query index and local so uh obviously URL okay can we get that okay so we are talking in the chat okay so uh okay so first the first parameter is Ur So it's pretty understood what they require simply copy it from right here copy it paste and we going to go okay next it's asking what is the query parameter okay so what does query mean okay so",
  "parameter okay so what does query mean okay so let's check okay okay so the query parameter is basically we have to enter table here okay so it it's either a list or a table okay so uh let's say if you have a list present in your uh in your web page then it will give you a list you can use this list parameter else you can use a table parameter okay so obviously because we have a table let's use the table parameter okay and in the index one it's pretty understood what we require it's asking us",
  "pretty understood what we require it's asking us that do we which in which you know which number of table we want because a particular page can have multiple tables right and uh uh because this is the only table on this page so I'll be entering the index parameter as zero okay let's hope it works F crossed okay so it's asking us to allow access all right all right my friends so this has successfully extracted the data set then data from that web page okay so these are the top 50 animes and you",
  "page okay so these are the top 50 animes and you can see that we are able to access this okay and also we got the first the headers as well that's pretty good because uh over here we have these headers that's why we got these headers okay so any questions regarding this any questions so Auto automatically finds the table Yeah it automatically finds the table Also let's say if I had another table on this web page then I will have to you know manipulate the index parameter so then let's say I",
  "the index parameter so then let's say I want the second table then I have to use one in the query parameter okay so this should be fun it works like python in Tex right any other question so it it is it is like a table but not like the first table we just start from the first thing H what is it can you please repeat so so what did you say like zero means Z basically means that it will access the first table on the web page nothing yeah so it will access the first table on the web page zero",
  "will access the first table on the web page zero means that okay okay and if you will use one it will access the second table so it's like python index so in Python in a list we have let's say we have 10 elements then obviously the the index of the first element won't be one it would be zero okay python uses zero indexing that's the exact same thing this function is going to use all right so any more questions or should we move ahead this was one of the one of the most easy questions uh of this",
  "of the one of the most easy questions uh of this G and uh I guess we have to find uh we have to do some aggregate operations on that and that can be easily done in Excel right okay so I guess there are no further questions so we can move ahead okay let's close this close this as well cross okay so our next question is crapping the IMDb web page with JavaScript so if you guys remember very first live session I took uh for TDS I explained using I explained the use of query selectors in a it was a",
  "the use of query selectors in a it was a really great explanation from what I uh can say so it was a really good was really good uh you know explanation of this concept uh if you guys want you can check that as well but uh I'll be going through that once again okay yeah you open your mic to have any question I that map thing which we did right map thing we selected we selected something then we mapped it to yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly and I at the end of the last session I gave you the task",
  "the end of the last session I gave you the task to extract the names of all people all participants in this meeting so yeah it was a pretty good live session if you guys want to watch that you can just simply go to the YouTube page of TDS and you can watch that okay no worries so for extracting this IMDb uh data set what we're going to do obviously I won't show you how to ex the IMDb data set uh but uh actually in that live session I showed you how to use the IMDb data set and how you can use",
  "how to use the IMDb data set and how you can use Query selectors to use that yeah so R has pasted something okay so if you want to spef in this live session I won't be showing you how to you know extract things with IMDb I will be showing you uh how to do that using another website but if you want to see that MDB extraction you can you just have you have to go for the first live session of TDS okay okay so again uh so this particular question we will be you know dealing with three case",
  "we will be you know dealing with three case scenarios okay first one first scenario would be that the Json data is pretty much available okay so we'll be we'll be looking at how you can extract using Json next we'll be looking if the Json data is not available to you okay then how you going to extract so for that you have two other ways okay so we'll be looking into those two other ways as well so it's like a three case scenarios we are going to look at okay so let's go back to the IMDb page",
  "to look at okay so let's go back to the IMDb page and I will go to the uh it was okay yeah so this was the page and let's check do we have a Json object which is being fetched let's reload it ni it should be right here okay it's not here [Music] okay it's just going with that all right what we can do is we can go to another website which actually allows using Json uh for that perhaps we can use another API call okay all right I will be using uh again for this particular case I'll be using my",
  "again for this particular case I'll be using my own website okay because I'm not able to you know think of any other website which which will actually you know it's populating the data which is which it's fetching from uh somewhere okay so this is my web page if you guys haven't uh if you guys know because I have seen I've shown this multiple times during my previous live sessions Okay so in this website what I'm doing is that I have all these information so these are all these informations you",
  "so these are all these informations you can see so everything is being fetched using Json okay so I haven't hardcoded any anything okay so these this this particular uh you know section of my skills these programming languages and blah blah blah blah blah everything is been fetched using Json I haven't hardcoded anything I haven't written this python right over here okay so everything has been fetched using a Json object and then it's been populated right over okay and that's true for each and",
  "right over okay and that's true for each and every page on this website so let's say if I go to go to the learn uh tab you can see that all these are being fetch using Json okay these are these haven't been hardcoded anyway okay same with this one my projects and same not same with actually I didn't have any need to you know hardcode this one okay so uh what I will be doing is I will be fetching this my projects okay so this is actually executing a Json object you can uh you can perhaps go to",
  "a Json object you can uh you can perhaps go to my website and you can go to inspect and uh uh if you want to see where are the where are those J objects being you know fetched from you can go to this networks tab right here okay I have to reload it once okay so this is the Json object so uh to to be able to see the exact Json object which being fetched you have to so by default it will be it will be you know all will be selected over here okay so it's all selected right over here but when you",
  "so it's all selected right over here but when you have to you know specifically search for J on objects you have to click over fetch SLX HR and then you will be able to see that these are the Json so you will be able to find the Json object right over here okay so if I click over here you can see that the entire data is right here okay so it's being fetched from here and what I can do is uh you guys are giving thumbs up is this is there something uh going on no sir actually I was just it was",
  "uh going on no sir actually I was just it was because of uh that I was getting understood by your explanation that's why I gave okay okay so this is the Json object and so I what I did was I was I just simply dou over here and and it just open this Json object okay so what I can do is I can copy this URL from here and let me open my DDS uh let me open my vs code it's here and let's create a new folder for okay it's going be 4.5 by MB okay let's get a new [Music] one all right so our python",
  "get a new [Music] one all right so our python notebook is ready so how I can you know fetch this AA from my uh python notebook that's pretty simple import the so we have few steps to follow import the uh requests Library okay run it it's executed and now what you can do is simply requests.get and inside this request.get you simply have to paste this URL run it and it will give you this response so this is the response object so how you can extract the ch Json object from this simply use this",
  "the ch Json object from this simply use this method okay so this is the particular syntax that you have to use to extract a Json object from your file okay run this and you can see that the entire Jon object is in front of you okay so uh this can be done and uh okay all right so this is how you can actually extract Json objects from an API end point okay using python notebooks otherwise this could have been simply done using you know uh Thunder client as well so what is thunder client it",
  "client as well so what is thunder client it actually sends requests you know it actually sends these API requests on your behalf to the uh to the end point okay so you don't have to write the this entire you know you don't have to create this notebook and write this code it will do this for you okay so you can simply click on new request and so this is actually an extension so you have to install Thunder client from here Thunder client so you have to install this instrict extension from vs code",
  "to install this instrict extension from vs code okay and then you'll be able to use this okay so simply paste this URL which I just past which I just copied and then send and you can see this entire Json object is in front of me okay so any question regarding this this particular section this was actually case one where you have Json object you can access it from anywhere so you don't need any authentication key or anything any questions anyone any questions all right that's pretty good okay so",
  "questions all right that's pretty good okay so let's go ahead then let's go towards the second case study okay so in the second case it's going to be a you know it's it will be a really great uh example for you guys and uh uh let me tell you that these types of examples may or may not be there in your Roe so Ro which is you know claimed to be one of the most difficult uh exams to pass in this entire degree program so in that it this particular thing can be there or cannot be there okay so so",
  "thing can be there or cannot be there okay so so let's see what is this thing okay so can you give me that URL once that IPL one uh the one that is for JS right yeah okay wait a second I have closed it I will have to refine it no okay so jaaj has shared this link with us you guys can you know open this uh up from this uh from the chat box and you can open this web page okay so the thing with this web page is okay accept case and over here we have kind of a similar thing so we have a table and",
  "kind of a similar thing so we have a table and we have to extract this data okay so you can do this using you know import HTML function which we just talked about but that's not the agenda for this particular case okay what we have to do is you have to extract it using the Json object okay so you have to extract it without using that Excel and you have to you know kind of fetch off that juston object okay so can anyone guide me how you can actually achieve that just open your mic and start",
  "achieve that just open your mic and start guiding me guys uh so Shan maybe it is fetching through some API calls you can check in the network tab uh yeah it may be it's it's fetching from that API call but I'm asking each I'm asking the students over here to you know guide me anyone just open your mic and guide me how you can actually get that Chon op I just showed you on my website how you can do that or perhaps I will randomly start calling names sir can we just copy the link and uh send",
  "names sir can we just copy the link and uh send request to the Thunder client let's do that I will just copy it that's a really good uh way let's check if this works or not I will send it and okay we have got this you know HTML file we don't have this Json object so how can you fish this now anyone else or uh what's your name okay arov arav any other way which you can think yes sir any other way what do you guys think or should I uh uh let's talk with saki saki right saki are you there yes sir",
  "with saki saki right saki are you there yes sir can you please guide me how can I you know fetch this particular Json object from this web page sir actually I joined late that's why I didn't uh get uh what you done before that's why I couldn't it's just it's a simple exercise where we are actually you know trying to extract the Json object and using the network tab that's just a hint and can you guide it in that okay let's let me open this inspect menu so the first step is opening up the",
  "inspect menu so the first step is opening up the inspect menu now where do I have to go can anyone tell me sir in network tab exactly let's go to the network tab okay so uh when you go to the network tab you might see this that perform a request or hit a you know controlr to load this so why is this happening you just have to uh reload this once and then it will just perfect work perfectly fine okay so we have done this right and okay so I can see that the fetch SL xrx xhr so this is the tab",
  "see that the fetch SL xrx xhr so this is the tab where we actually you know extract the Json object from so if you are going to see any you know API or Json objects which is which are being fetched on this web page so it would be present right over here okay but are you are you guys able to see anything over here [Music] anyone no like you're not able to see right let's check in the doc ones so in the doc we have this 2023 right let's open this on and check it okay so I will open it right away",
  "on and check it okay so I will open it right away okay so we have this particular page okay so this is another HTML page and uh actually this is the exact same thing which we got in our uh when we ran this URL and you know sent the request so this is the exact same thing which we got but there is no Json object right you guys are not able to see the Json object but why did they do it like this exactly so some developers are weird perhaps they decided to do something else rather than using a",
  "decided to do something else rather than using a Json object and uh when I will tell you what's the answer for this you guys will actually realize that it's actually a bad practice kind of to do this okay so people who are trying to you know Access Data from a website they won't be able to so this is a bad practice according to me maybe they do not want people scraping the data from but actually we are able to scrap so when we when we will actually look at the solution you will realize that",
  "look at the solution you will realize that okay so it can be done but it's you know you know twisting your arm to hold your left ear kind of okay so all right so I will give you guys the answer so there are two ways to extract this okay can anyone tell me how can I extract this without using this Json object and without that import htable this would be the first way are you guys able to see something right over here can we do something with the front end there's another hint for you can we do",
  "front end there's another hint for you can we do something with the front end so what is the front end so this is the front end okay this is nothing but the front end so can we do something with this front end anyone you can select the matuse that's one way we can you know select this entire page on place in Excel and uh msxl is pretty good at doing this these kinds of things but usually this is not the best case scenario and it will actually you know increase your it's a table right so all",
  "you know increase your it's a table right so all these values they are TR taxs exactly right we can select those taxs and then TDK tag there are the values which we want absolutely so for so we can kind of D through all of them then store them exactly so what Ric is saying so you you guys might be wondering that why am I you know asking you guys each and everything why am I'm not just giving you the answer right away so this is how you actually debug something not debug so this is how you",
  "debug something not debug so this is how you actually try to solve something this is how you actually try to you know push yourself towards the answer towards the solution of a problem okay so that's why I'm I'm involving you guys in this discussion and that's really important okay just a second I need to attach my charger all right so we are good to go okay so uh Rik you told me that you can actually extract this data using the TR TX right but so what do you mean by the TR T so do we have to",
  "so what do you mean by the TR T so do we have to you know copy each and every value and paste in our Excel F or is yeah you can do that just the console which exactly we can do that and uh uh because no one of you suggested that I assume that it's a kind of black it's it's a kind of dark area for you guys you guys are not aware about that query select terment so we will so I will just you know go through that once again okay so when you have problem such as this when you are so whenever you are",
  "such as this when you are so whenever you are asked to you know access you you are asked to go to a website and you know take out extract other data so your first step towards extracting it should be go to the network step go to the networks tab click over this fetch XR xhr Tab and then check do we have a Json object do we have something related to that let's check the doc ones do we have something if you get it that's pretty good that's great you can just simply use that otherwise in this for",
  "can just simply use that otherwise in this for example in this case we don't have that okay so in that case you're going to use the query selectors okay so what are these query selectors let's get into okay so uh okay so what does a query selector query selectors basically uh it acts like a way you can select a particular element from this HTML content okay and then and do something with it okay so what am I say by the way you can extract uh this table in Excel very easily absolutely we can do",
  "table in Excel very easily absolutely we can do that so this can be easily done using import HTML function but what we are going to show you so but that's that's actually not the you know agenda for this particular exercise so you can simply do this using you know import HTML but what we are trying to teach you over here is that how you can do this using query selectors and one more method which we're going to talk about so that's the surprise method that we have in store for you guys okay so",
  "method that we have in store for you guys okay so uh let's get into it and let's see how you can extract it okay so this is along with this elements tab we have this console tab as right we have this console Tab and what it does is it's actually useful it's actually used to clear this out once it's clear yeah so what it does is it's it's capable of running GS code for you okay so so it will be running JS code on this particular web page and then you can you know use JS code for accessing",
  "then you can you know use JS code for accessing elements and do something or whatnot okay so uh let's look at what are qu SS okay let's say I want to fetch out the names of all these 20 players okay so I want to fetch out the names of all these 20 players let's see how I can do that okay so so I want you guys to pay at most atmost attent attention to this and uh let's see how you can actually achieve this particular thing okay so for that because I have to extract the names of these players go",
  "I have to extract the names of these players go to you have first you have to check that where these names are being stored okay so these names are being stored somewhere in this particular tag okay so can you see this I guess I should zoom in a bit right so too much too much yeah so the name shanil is being stored in this particular HTML tag so it's a div tag but let's not call it that way so okay so this is a so this is an HTML tag and it's storing the name of that player right and what you",
  "the name of that player right and what you will find is so if you want to you know if I want to select something on this page I just have to Simply click on this arrow button click over here and then you will be able to see then you will be you know it will just directly take you to that particular web to that particular element right so what you will notice is that this particular thing this particular syntax is common for each and every name on this web page okay so if I go back to Schuman",
  "on this web page okay so if I go back to Schuman once you can see that this thing this this these classes and these this this kind of syntax is common for each and every name on this web page right if I go to uh fa2 yeah Dy you can see that this is common this is this was the same thing which was present for Schuman I go if I go to con you can see that this is exactly the same thing right so what we can do right now is that so I will just show you how you can access it and then I'll be",
  "show you how you can access it and then I'll be explaining you how it actually works right so for this you have to find a common thing which you have to find a common thing which is you know present in each and every each and every element which contains these names right so I will copy this common thing so this is a common thing for me which is actually present in each and every name right remember this part okay I will just copy this and I will go to the console T so I will be writing a few",
  "go to the console T so I will be writing a few lines of code not a few line just a line of code and then then I will be explaining you how it works right so I will quickly write that line of code once and then we'll see okay so this was the line of code and I'm going to perform uh bit more okay and we will be extracting the all right so this one line of code actually gave me this entire you know this it gave me the entire the names of all these 20 players who are present in this table right by",
  "20 players who are present in this table right by the way your your mic is open are you trying to say something okaying along yeah not a problem okay so are you guys able to see that we actually extracted the names of all these players somehow okay now now let's just understand how this particular line of code works okay so I'll be dissecting this line one by each one by one okay so let's look at this particular section of this code okay so when I execute this so as you might remember so this",
  "I execute this so as you might remember so this is the common thing which we had in each and every name on this page right so what I did was I placed a dot in front of it and there is a dollar dollar there's something dollar dollar okay you may not know what is this dollar dollar okay so there is something dollar dollar and then we are opening a kind of function thing and then we are pasting then we are you know using a string you know we are pasting this kind of text in it okay so this is the",
  "this kind of text in it okay so this is the common thing and we have a dot in front of it and it's present in this dollar dollar function okay and it's somehow it's fetching each and everything right now what it actually does let's understand that okay so this dollar dollar is actually the it actually establishes of connection from your console tab so this is a console tab right from your console tab to your element St okay so this dollar dollar is kind of establishing this connection between",
  "is kind of establishing this connection between your console Tab and your elements tab right okay and then what we are doing is that we are pasting this common thing inside this dollar dollar okay with a prefix dot okay so what does this dot mean if you guys know HTML so that would so you might know what this dot means so this dot is basically used to represent classes right so if you have a class if you let's say uh if you're going to access a class so you have to prefix it with a DOT okay",
  "a class so you have to prefix it with a DOT okay otherwise if you have a ID you have to pre prefix it with a hash okay so this is how actually CSS works and uh so dot is for class you guys I recommend you guys to you know actually note this down because why not okay and Dot is for classes hashes for ID okay so what does this ID mean ID is a unique thing for it's a unique uh kind of uh you know it's a unique name given to an particular element for instance uh let's say uh let's say I'm my name",
  "instance uh let's say uh let's say I'm my name is s right I'm a TA in TDS okay so if I am going to consider that let's if I'm if like let's say if I'm going to consider in this this particular scenario all the T in TDS right so all the TD all the TS in TDS who are those JJ and saraj right so jaaj and Saran what what does what do we both have in common so we are tdss okay so tdst is a thing is a commonality between us right so when we are considering something which is common among multiple",
  "something which is common among multiple things where going to use classes okay so this is how it works so classes are something like that so we both so J and me we both lie in this class of tdst okay but when we are going to consider so if if we are going to you know uh when we're talking about IDs let's say so IDs can be understood using my name is Sange right and his name is Ja so that's an ID for us okay in this in this TD tdsa scenario right so tdsa okay so tdsa is a class for us right and",
  "so tdsa okay so tdsa is a class for us right and our names is our ID okay our name or our ID so ID is something which are used to uniquely identify something right so I guess that's pretty much understood any doubts regarding this class and ID and this particular section of code any doubts then then I'll be you know proceeding with the next section of this code guys any doubts all right so I guess you guys have no doubts uh okay okay so uh you guys must be wondering that uh what is this right",
  "guys must be wondering that uh what is this right so what is this so can anyone just tell me what is this uh Anand morti can you please tell me what is this what is this particular line of code has got us just instances of all these specific value right wherever St whatever the class is there exactly so can anyone other other than rck tell me what is this it will uh told us that uh from element uh what will be the this class name uh the list all of the the list of all members which contains",
  "all of the the list of all members which contains this class name yeah absolutely you're right Saki and you're right Rik as well so this line of codee will actually extract all the elements in from our HTML code which have this class sttp STP name okay so this is actually a class right so it will extract all the names all the elements which contain this class okay so can you see that this is an this is actually an element this actually a you know piece of code which has its own properties for",
  "piece of code which has its own properties for example it has uh you know if I open this uh it has multiple things inside it so can you see this that it has something like inner text and inside this inner text you are able to see shill right so this this element actually is an entire instance of that particular piece of good so if you if you are wondering so what kind of jish San is saying so you can understand it this way so this particular element is present over right here okay so it's",
  "element is present over right here okay so it's present right here and it contains the text inside it so it contains this Con this Devon con inside right now now how can I extract so obviously I don't need this need this entire piece of code right but I want the names of those of these players who are inide right so how can I extract it so for that I'm using this map function so what does this map function do so this map is something like it's running a for loop on each and every element of",
  "running a for loop on each and every element of this array right so it's running a for loop on each and every element of this uh array and then it's executing something on each and every element right so this item is it's nothing but a VAR kind of variable and it's executing something on this on each and every on each and every element okay so uh for instance I can just change this I for I can just change this item to I as well okay so it's like you know in Python we have for loops and in for",
  "you know in Python we have for loops and in for Loops we usually do it for I in range right or for I in a particular list right this is a common uh function this is a common syntax which most people use and you know it's something which has been taught from one deop one teacher to another student so it's like it has become a convention now to use for I in range and you know so I has become that kind of variable which is used by each and every person right so uh you can use this otherwise I can",
  "right so uh you can use this otherwise I can just simply you know use something as as I can use this as well so it's working I can use my own name as well because why not right it will work now as well okay so this is like a it's like a variable on each and every element so it's like representing each and every element and it's then it's executing something on each and every element so what it's executing it's actually taking out the inner text from each and every element okay so what does this",
  "each and every element okay so what does this inner text mean if you guys if you just go over here and you scroll down so this is one instance so this is the first instance uh in this array if you just open this and you scroll down you will reach uh you should reach right over here so you will find this inner HTML and inner text okay so in this inner text and HTML you are able to see that okay so we have shanil in inner text okay so you can you have to use this in a text attribute and then it",
  "have to use this in a text attribute and then it will you know fetch each and every if we Sorry uh sir if we put inner HTML that is also containing sham Gill so what will it uh do yeah that's a really good question and let's see what we will do by the way Hara were you also trying to say something yeah actually I just joined in what are we discussing here is it g 4 or yeah GF I have some doubts regarding that project actually like when can we discuss like U for projects perhaps we'll be having",
  "like U for projects perhaps we'll be having more sessions in the next week or uh on I have doubt regarding the scope itself is it okay if you can clear it off within like five minutes UHA maybe at the end we can take doubts related to project one uh yeah uh when uh is it actually like what time I can rejoin back like it's 9: now so maybe at 9:45 is that uh end actually like when is end actually like it's 10 p.m. 10 p.m. okay I'll join back at 10 okay please I need some outs actually like um",
  "10 okay please I need some outs actually like um yeah thank you thank you so much all right so okay so let's answer saki's question now Okay so you guys can see that it's it's a really great question that why aren't we using inner HTML as well right so uh over here you can see that shman gill is present in both inner HTM and inner text okay but why are we using inner text instead of inner HTML so if you go by the name inner HTML so inner HTML yeah it's absolutely you know it's fetching the",
  "yeah it's absolutely you know it's fetching the names of our players as well but but can anyone guess the difference between them between these functions anyone just guess the difference saki do you have any guesses any guesses no sir I can't see any difference on the console are you able to you know by the by reading these names you know in a text and in ating does this give any clue to you maybe uh using inner text it is giving us text and for inner HTML maybe it is giving HTML code kind of",
  "inner HTML maybe it is giving HTML code kind of thing absolutely that's actually correct so the thing is that uh inside this element so actually so inside this element the only thing the only you know the only uh HTML which is present are the name is the name of the player okay so that's why it's working but if I do something like this just don't ask me what I'm doing just follow along along okay so I have done something like this okay all right so now we have something in this element right",
  "so now we have something in this element right now if I run in a text that's same so that's pretty same so that's exactly the same thing which we got using without changing anything right but if we execute in our HTML are you able to see some difference in Deon cor's name yes yes it is yes it is giving code the whole code line which is exactly so inner HTML will give you the entire code which is present in that element okay which is like a direct child of that element okay in an HTML what it",
  "child of that element okay in an HTML what it will give you it will actually give you the entire text which is only the text which is present in that element okay so this is the difference between in a text and in an HTML okay and thank you saki for bringing up that question and uh you know that that's going to help you guys as well okay so that was the difference between inner text and inner HT right and uh what does this actually this is a bold tag so if you are able to see then it actually",
  "tag so if you are able to see then it actually emboldened the name of Devon Conway right so it's actually giving it's actually returning the Bold tags as well okay so this was the uh so this is how you can actually fetch this and let's say uh by the way any questions regarding this particular line of code this particular any questions and guys let me tell you if you have any questions and if you think that it's silly go ahead with this simply ask ts are for you sir one more thing in class name",
  "ts are for you sir one more thing in class name we have uh St ply uh name also we have ND and binding also so why don't we why did we not include that in the class name also that's a really great question saki that's another really good question okay so let's try using this class as well okay so if I go back to uh this particular line of code we can see that we have another class present which is NG binding right let's replace this class with Ng this and I will let me clear this okay I'll just",
  "this and I will let me clear this okay I'll just run it once uh okay so what we will do is I will replace this STD ply with this one okay so the thing is this NG building is actually a class which is present in these uh you know runs mat Innings no average and all these kind of strats as well this is something which is present in each and every stat so if I go right here you can see this NG biting class right so that's why it makes it you know it it makes it in ineligible for extracting this",
  "it it makes it in ineligible for extracting this data because it will give you the it will just give you uh uh each and every you know it will just give you each and all these values as well along with the name so that's not much useful so that's another thing which you have to keep in mind that whenever you are going to extract a person let's say if I want to extract the name of this player what I have to do is I have to find a specific class which is common in all names but it's not present",
  "which is common in all names but it's not present in any other any other kind of uh it's not present in any other um element right so for us stly name was that class right so saki does that answer a question no sir thank you sir okay so let's move ahead and uh okay so this was everything about this console one and also one more thing let's say if you want to you know copy this name you want to you know copy this we just copy this once copy it here okay so let's say I want to copy this entire",
  "here okay so let's say I want to copy this entire list somehow and paste it in my you know uh some txt file or Json file let's say so how can I do this simply enclose this entire code okay so enclose this entire code in a copy function okay then you will be simply able to do this okay now if I go and create a you know text file let's say layers. pxt simple okay so this is how you can copy this entire list and you know paste it some somewhere else okay so this was it about using uh the the",
  "else okay so this was it about using uh the the console menu and using the query selections CSS selectors to you know extract the data all right so now let's look at that third case scenario that that third way we are going to extract our data okay so as you guys remember that in the networks tab we don't have the Json object anywhere right we don't have any Json object and we are not able to find it in any of these tabs right so we aren't able to find in any of these tabs but let's go back to",
  "to find in any of these tabs but let's go back to this docs tab okay so what does doc me so if I just open it to close okay so if I just open this doc once and uh over here we are able to find that we have something called 2023 right now if you scroll on a bit so this is the you know the surprise way you can actually find the data right so let's say you aren't able to find any Json objects okay and you know you you are exhausted you are not able to find and uh you know uh you have to you know",
  "to find and uh you know uh you have to you know you have this uh kind of Kink that you have to go ahead with the Json object only and you have to find the Json object somehow okay so how you can do this sometimes the Json object it's present in the JavaScript of the code as well okay so sometimes JavaScript is used to populate the pages okay and then for for instance in ginger so Ginger is a uh is a tool which can be used to you know populate HTML with data using python so uh you you need not",
  "with data using python so uh you you need not be you know going into much depth of Ginger but Ginger is a tool which actually allows you to do this which actually allows you to you know populate Pages using python so in this web page they are using some a kind of similar approach okay so what they are doing is if you just scroll down on this 2023 document once you will find this script okay you'll find the script and just a second it was somewhere here if I'm not wrong uh just a second SEC okay",
  "here if I'm not wrong uh just a second SEC okay it's uh where it is it is so it's actually running a script which is populating the entire web page right so I'm not able to find that particular script but okay I guess this is the one kind of okay so if you are able to see that we have something like this we have something uh uh like this so it's running a function it's calling few things and then it's you know creating an element right it's creating new elements using inline Javas so this is",
  "new elements using inline Javas so this is Javascript and it's R it's you know creating new elements for us so this is actually a really poor way I would from my point of view so it's a really poor way to you know populate data in your data set and uh something big as IPL it's it's doing this so that's pretty weird and uh uh you know if you're building website so this is not recommend this is absolutely not recommended to do so what they're doing is they are creating new elements with",
  "doing is they are creating new elements with JavaScript and then pop in those elements with uh the data okay so for that we actually have to go to the Json tab okay not Jon the JavaScript tab okay so this is a JavaScript tab uh Tab and over here you will be able to find that we have multiple javascripts present over here okay and one of these javascripts actually have the data okay if I let's say if I just want to open this competitions. Json right not Json this is JS again and again I'm saying",
  "not Json this is JS again and again I'm saying Json so if I if I just open this competition JJs so what you can see is that the entire Json object is present over here okay so this is actually a Json object which is present in a on completion function okay so that's a pretty weird way to do do things but they have done this somehow okay so you can see that this is actually so this entire data is giving you information about the comp about the matches which have taken place okay so you can see",
  "which have taken place okay so you can see that competition ID uh what which kind of competition it was it was a one day test and uh the time zone and all and the stats coding and all each and everything so you can find all these kinds of data this one okay but again we have to find the data about the you know about our batsman so let's look for more uh let's look for more uh in more JS files let's open this one okay so this file if you just have a look in it you will be able to find that it's",
  "a look in it you will be able to find that it's about I guess it is about yeah it's again about the matches so uh each and every match is being stored in this date in this uh Json object and you can see that math summary and all complet that competition ID uh match name so it was chenai Super Kings versus gujar Titans right this was the name of the match and uh so you can also see that first batting team name was Gujarat Titans so Gujrat Titans actually played the first Innings and the second",
  "actually played the first Innings and the second batting team name was this one so CSK played the second one and I guess there should also be the winners one see if there is a winners one okay okay so you can see that each and every detail about these matches are being stored over here right and see okay so uh okay so but again the data we need the data we are searching for about the players is not present over here right so if I open this next if I open this next JS object which is top run",
  "if I open this next JS object which is top run scorers so top run scorers and we're looking at the top batsman right so it's ringing some Bells I just open this one here you will be able to see the entire data about our top batsman right so you can see that shman gill has a is at the top and the data which is being populated over here is present right over here okay so if I see that total runs so this runs tab is being filled with this one this total runs okay so the entire data is present over",
  "runs okay so the entire data is present over here so this is actually the Json object and uh how you can access this what I will do is I will simply open it in another Tab and I will just copy this URL once I will copy this URL okay this entire URL I will copy and then go to Thunder client okay paste and I will send it and you can see that we have received this object okay I will copy it okay I've have copied this entire thing okay otherwise you can simply copy it from here as well but I will",
  "can simply copy it from here as well but I will you know discourage you from actually opening just a so I will discourage you from opening uh you know Json these kinds of objects in your web page because sometimes it you know crashes your Google application as well so this this has happened with me multiple times so it was quite painful so uh avoid this what you can do is simply you know copy the URL once there should be an option copy URL yeah copy URL go to Thunder client or Postman so",
  "yeah copy URL go to Thunder client or Postman so Postman is another way you can use it okay go to Thunder CLI then copy this entire thing okay now I will paste it over here okay and okay okay all right [Music] so yeah now what I will do is so I will remove this this on top run scorer kind of function thing and from the very bottom I will remove this okay Mo this now simply there should be thing of format formatting format okay here okay guess it's reading this file or something but uh uh it's",
  "reading this file or something but uh uh it's not formatting it as as I want okay so actually this is your Json object and and this is how you can use it let me just uh rename this to Json ones then it would work it's renamed okay now now it's working so you can just click on format document and guys we have we have arrived at this so you can see that this this kind of similar fun this kind of similar syntax is available to us and you can use this Json object uh to your heart's content right so",
  "Json object uh to your heart's content right so this was the kind of forbidden way or the hidden way which you can extract data and few websites which kind of have poor developers do this and uh sometimes you have to you know twist your arm to get there right so this was it about using this any questions regarding this any questions this is still uh kind of as as you said arm twisting way of kind of because you have to go through all the JS files to find this is there some way we can directly",
  "to find this is there some way we can directly can you please repeat we have to open all these JS files and then figure out is what was a question can be done in some easy way like can it be done in some easy way like finding this specific Json this F actually this is not a Json this is a JS file right so uh uh I won't say that there is a simple way to do this because you know sometimes in this case we have a pretty low number of J JS files but sometimes we have a lot more number of lot a",
  "but sometimes we have a lot more number of lot a pretty large number of Js Js files but uh the only way which I can think of is going to like kind of each and every file each and every GS file or you can you know search you can you know read the name of the Json file and then try to you know relate it with the use case you using so top runs scholar it's actually ringing some BS so perhaps we're talking about the top batsman right so uh you know you have to manually check it in most cases",
  "know you have to manually check it in most cases perhaps this is the only way we can approach this all right so if there are not no further questions then I would like T to take over with the next question this one okay I won't exactly do this question but Shan yes okay have we uh introduced a beautiful soup not yet okay then that's what I will do now which web P should we use okay maybe okay does [Music] anyone have any idea which we page we can use we just want some data and I don't want to",
  "use we just want some data and I don't want to use Wikipedia and I want to send a request to it what kind of request do you want to make for so yeah jaaj you can actually use my website for you know explaining beautiful uh yeah I will be using that but uh I think your [Music] website for for so actually on the Shon website it gets populated with using API calls but what I want I want to use some a static website so which was okay let me see yeah my uh you should write I will just give you the",
  "my uh you should write I will just give you the link once okay so we will be using that my anime list one again once again okay by the way if you guys have any other suggestion you can propose to us yes so I have to send that okay this seems to be a static website so let's go ahead and use request module to actually get this okay before we do that we can actually verify if it is a static website by just hitting a this URL so it should have this um this one so um let's check that okay yeah it",
  "um this one so um let's check that okay yeah it does have this one okay so now we can actually get this uh HTML Page by just requesting this particular web page and then we'll use beautiful soup to par so similar same what Shan have done in uh console tab we'll do it using beautiful soup to use CSS selector to get the data so now let me create one file by explain them what is beautiful soup ons okay uh so uh using console tab we can actually uh pass this Dom structure and then we can apply some",
  "this Dom structure and then we can apply some filters based on uh some attributes or some classes or IDs so same thing we can do that in uh using Beautiful soap so right now what we have got we have sent a request to uh this URL and then this is what we have got in response the response you have got is just a plain HTML and this is same HTML that is there in for populating this website so we can interact with this HTML using beautiful soup same way we did it using our document. query selector",
  "way we did it using our document. query selector which selects something based on the uh CSS selectors so actually uh whatever I did whatever I just showed you using the console tab using that dollar dollar and that function thing so that was actually using actually use uh using JavaScript to execute those functionalities but that same thing can be done using python as well using beautiful so so that's what we are trying to achieve over here okay so I will use this piece of cod and let's go to",
  "so I will use this piece of cod and let's go to web page beautiful soup documentation and this is how we install beautiful soup uh this is co-pilot response so I will just go to the documentation to verify if this is correct I think what is the way to install installing beautiful soup and this is the way we can use using p okay so now before going to beautiful Su we will actually have to use request module to request that particular HTML page so I will import request first and then we will",
  "so I will import request first and then we will restore the response that we got from by requesting the URL that we copied and now we have got the response now what I will do I will use beautiful soup to to pass this HTML so how do how do you navigate between your clipboard uh okay uh if I just press window and then V then I can access my uh okay okay clipboard okay so this is how we can import from bs4 we can import beautiful soup and then so in the response what we have got is an HTML",
  "so in the response what we have got is an HTML document right because over here at the very first line of code uh it's written over here document type is HTML and now since it's HTML document we can use beautiful soup to parts and in the parser we will tell HTML parts so generally there are two different kind of parsers one is XML and this is HTML so XML files are also used to store uh information in the same way but that we will do in some other session so right now I am use I will use this",
  "session so right now I am use I will use this HTML parser to pass this um whatever we got in the response um I'm getting confused with these things okay uh so soup is equal to before that I will have to import beautiful soup so I will just copy these two lines of code from beautiful soup documentation and over here in HTML doc we will have to use request oh not request response. text and let's call it HTML uncore talk so this contains the same HTML code that we got by requesting through Thunder",
  "code that we got by requesting through Thunder client and now let's just print it uh actually we can printify it so if I just print it now if I go back and let's use UV run peyp and okay now we have got the same HTML just to verify I will just uh save it in some file and then we can check 1 do HTML oh I was going to this is what we have and it is same HTML code that we got by requesting uh from Thunder CL now on this soup object what I will do I will try to so uh so this is soup object that we",
  "will try to so uh so this is soup object that we have so it have same structure HTML and then within it it have head and then body which actually have some information now we will be using this find method so this find method is similar to query selector in JavaScript so over here we will tell uh which all um which all tags or some classes or whatever it needs to select so I will use do find and now what we want to select um okay where is the this is the one now let's go to inspect Tab and by",
  "is the one now let's go to inspect Tab and by clicking over here and by clicking over here I think I can actually get this copy element and let me print it somewhere okay this have got the actual element instead of that what so I I can actually so in this Dom structure I can get its query selector by clicking on copy and then copy selector this would use some if there are multiple um so here we have in this table we have multiple elements right if there are multiple elements then I think it",
  "if there are multiple elements then I think it would use n oh okay okay let's use this as the query selector so ID must be no uh just give me one minute okay so we'll use this particular uh ID to get the um get this element so let's use this and let me call it element and now let's just print the element and this pry what it would do if its structure is not same as HTML then it would just prettify it so it it will it will be the same text but it will look much nicer so now let's execute this",
  "it will look much nicer so now let's execute this command oh I should not write it out file let's just use this okay over here we have got this thing okay what was the JS path maybe okay let me check what does this give oh hash e e okay let's use this uh n type object have no attribute prettyy that is because so so this element is we we could not find anything with this particular ID and if I use if I just use this maybe it would work that is because over in on the web page we have hashtag in",
  "over in on the web page we have hashtag in front of it [Music] okay let's use this okay now we have got uh we have got we have selected this particular element let's have a look at it so we have anchor tag uh which is linked to I think this is same or tag and then within this it is the image one so I think there might be some image okay that is correct so the same way we can uh reest and we can pass it in beautiful zo so similar to this find in find actually we have to provide ID and then we",
  "find actually we have to provide ID and then we can even provide class by U using this particular way so for example I can get um this class and let's remove this ID is it class or class intercore I'm not sure okay that was class Ando so even if we specify that class it gets the same element that means in this particular uh page there is only one instance of this class no there are multiple oh that is why because I'm using find if we instead of so similar to query selector we use Query selector",
  "similar to query selector we use Query selector and query selector all now if I use find all then this would get all those elements let's do it again okay uh did you mean to call find element. pry in of prying let's use element only that is because this find all it's a list so we cannot prettify on list we can pry on one single element so I think let's check what is there I think these are 100 elements so first one is this one and then the second one should appear after some comma so maybe this",
  "one should appear after some comma so maybe this is the second one and then the name is okay this is the third one so I think are there 100 of them and next 50 if I go here and then next 50 okay there are more than 100 but over here this matches with 100 times so this class matches 100 time okay and so this is one way we can get the data using beautiful sou we can pass a HTML document uh instead of requesting from a file we can keep HTML code within a instead of requesting a uh web page we can",
  "a instead of requesting a uh web page we can have code in s file and we can pass that HTML file and then we can even extract something out of it using same method now we also have similar to this find all we have to provide this class underscore and I think maybe attributes I we need to provide using at keyword and we have item type as an attribute here and then this is the value of that item type so this is how we can create this but let us say we want to use the same method that we used to do",
  "we want to use the same method that we used to do uh for uh let me go back here we used to do when we were using console tab so if I just go here and then I think if I copy selector and now if I paste it here okay that is not the correct one let's go back and copy JS path and let me paste it yeah this is the one so it have selected this particular element now can I just provide this string similar to what we used to provide in query selector so there is one way beatiful soup select So within",
  "there is one way beatiful soup select So within beautiful soup okay it is not the correct page but maybe down somewhere we can find those methods so this opens it and then it passes [Music] um I think this is the one that we need to use okay uh this is from which okay p tutorial let's go here and Dot select and instead of using do find I will use dot select and now within select I don't have to put ID is equal to instead of doing that I can just provide the actual query selector that we have",
  "provide the actual query selector that we have used so I will copy this F and let's let's paste it here and let me okay let's sptify it okay um find we have used select okay I'm not sure what is that so let me remove prettyy okay okay so select gives us response in as a list so that means it matches with multiple selectors so it is equivalent of uh query selector all let me put a comment here select is equalent of quy selector all and I think there is one more method to select just one element",
  "is one more method to select just one element I think it is Select underscore 1 and if I use that now I should be able to even prettify it prettify p r e TT i f y yes so I have got the same element so these are two different ways One is using find and then the other one is using find all so in this particular question oh not this one in this particular question we are required to go to and so we are required to go to uh Wikipedia and then over there we need to go to is one particular country so",
  "we need to go to is one particular country so I will just type India and then Wikipedia so this would get us to India's page now instead of India let us say I type USA so it would get to United States page so by just changing this last bit I'm able to get go get to the particular country's speach so that's what we have to do in this assignment and once we get to the uh countries page then what we have to do we have to get all these H1 to H6 tags I think there are six H tags yeah and then we",
  "I think there are six H tags yeah and then we have to so uh for this we have to create then then we have to create one API so we what we have to do we can create a fast API server over here and then on that server we will create this particular end point and that accepts qu this country as a query parameter and then it will generate the markdown using these uh heading tags and yeah so instead of doing this assignment directly maybe over here um uh should I create uh okay okay okay first let me",
  "uh should I create uh okay okay okay first let me ask so whatever I have explained so far is it uh clear anyone have any doubt on that okay so now we can use fast API and let me import fast API running everything through UV right yeah yeah I'm running everything through UV so I don't want to create a virtual environment I think this is much faster uh is there a way to pass some argument to it I think no okay let me use I don't exactly remember syntax of fast API so fast API documentation",
  "syntax of fast API so fast API documentation example so let's use this mean by this in okay okay let's use this uh wait a second I will get back so and let's use this piece of code and I will send a request within this function and after sending request we'll keep this over here and we'll PA the soup object here itself and okay now what should we extract maybe we can extract all the anchor tags or maybe we can even ask for which yeah yeah we can do one thing we can uh create an API which when",
  "do one thing we can uh create an API which when supplied with the name of a anime then it will return the rank of that API of that anim that sound we provide name of anime yeah we provide the name of the anime return the rank and then it will respond with the rank yeah um actually so based on the name of the anime I think we won't be able to constract URL because every time it gets this random number no no I'm not talking about the URL instead can you please go back to the page yeah yeah so",
  "can you please go back to the page yeah yeah so from here M we can do one we can search for the particular TR the particular row which contains this name and then extract the rank element from that uh uh rank is right okay okay this is this is the rank right yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about okay okay uh actually we can match with text content content with this particular name whatever you pass in the query and then we can fetch the rank yeah absolutely that's possible so what we are",
  "yeah absolutely that's possible so what we are actually planning to do is can you please go back to the page once sure so what we are actually planning to do is we can extract the the the table room where this particular anime name is present and then we will be using that text content and then we'll extract the you know the number from the text content okay so I guess it would be very interesting H it is interesting exed okay it's a bit difficult as well yeah hi with you okay um so so let me",
  "as well yeah hi with you okay um so so let me figure out how do we pass query parameters I think is this the correct way yeah we just want a string right you can uh you can just create a new variable should be present oh oh in the function right function right yes yes so they should be Q within okay string okay this is also we have to give it yeah yeah instead of the Q we can you know give it an anime parameter maybe name yeah that will work or maybe any name that would be a long name for a",
  "or maybe any name that would be a long name for a parameter okay uh and maybe what should we call the handpoint let anime rank yeah rating that's [Music] good and uh yeah that should work okay uh I think this should work also J we also have to give a you know placeholder for that uh particular variable if you just swap back to that uh page once yeah you can see that this item ID we are also giving it in the URL as well that app get yeah that is because we are passing it as in within URL but we",
  "because we are passing it as in within URL but we we are passing this as an URL encoded parameter so this is not part of URL I mean it is part of URL so this item id it goes like this right but this Q would go something like this okay so that so if if you want to you know pass parameters then that's done using this all right yeah uh yeah shaki do you have any doubt actually I don't have doubt regarding this but I have uh previous out that whenever I I'm using fast API and this app thing which",
  "I I'm using fast API and this app thing which we have to run on Chrome the all question regarding this type this kind of uh thing is uh giving me error and I don't know why uh and I tried everything but I'm not able to solve it and I have post on the discourse uh every time but and you provided the solution still it is not working and I've said many time in the live session also but AP thing I'm not able to do it that's why in in question uh in ga2 versal uh question I have not done it in ga3",
  "ga2 versal uh question I have not done it in ga3 last three questions also I'm not able to solve I've tried everything with that what's the problem you facing is that the same thing sir it's uh it's it's the same thing that methods not allowed I've using I use Postman also to post the request to send the post request using that URL but it's still it's not working it's saying method not allowed the post method which I'm using in the question seven and eth actually when you have to pass a post",
  "and eth actually when you have to pass a post method then you have to mention it inside the methods uh you know parameter as well so G can you go to that can you go to thator that app you can continue with has sir one more thing you can continue with this in the last uh in the end of this session just uh give me some time and explain me how to do it I will share my screen and you can guide me with that because it was not working and I'm Fred up of using that and it this concept will be used in",
  "of using that and it this concept will be used in the project also so if I'm not able to understand it then I'm not able to uh do the project as well okay uh have you posted it on this course yes sir yes sir I've created on Ive created two times the post on this yesterday also and day before yesterday also okay can you please share the link to discour post I will just get into this question yes just sure so now we have requested oh oh yeah actually it's 10:00 so of can you have like five or 10",
  "it's 10:00 so of can you have like five or 10 minutes discussion on that project question on uh sorry Hara but I think let's complete this first otherwise it will break the a flow yeah approx I would say 10 minutes okaying into completing this yeah 10 minutes I yeah 10:15 yeah okay yeah and Saki you have a question saki you have raised your hand no sir it was previously raised I all right please share the link to your discourse post I will just look yeah yes sir I'm just sharing it just a",
  "just look yeah yes sir I'm just sharing it just a minute you can just you can share it in this chat box yeah yes sir okay uh so now we have got the soup element now actually we need to locate this table within this soup element um I mean sorry we have got the same Dom structure I should not call it soup element so what I need to get is this particular table with this class so let's use that um I we go here and then soup dot select of this table and then the name of the class and and now let me",
  "and then the name of the class and and now let me store it in tables or just call it table and now let me just make sure that there is only one table so I will just print length of table okay oh ah okay that is because that is because I have to run the server and is it within uh okay yeah it has to run using uon um I will just tell you I will just tell you the syntax you have to write open the yeah open the terminal you won't need this one you won't need this you can just comment this this will",
  "need this you can just comment this this will work now this should work but there is a better way to do this okay okay okay tell me can I just comment this yeah open that terminal once terminal sure and type in UV con uvi con UV I on okay space is it C or CN it's UV UV you have written U and yeah UV space the name of the application remove this do by colum app space dash dash reload Dash Dash okay I will have to mention UV over there I think this requires to install globally yeah I guess you",
  "requires to install globally yeah I guess you have to install it globally okay maybe I will just go with the that if uncore uncore name yeah sure for sure if you have you know if you have a virtual environment and you and you're not using UV then you can use that particular line of code to run your FL FAS application yes yes that if name and all that stuff I you the link uh the discourse link uh and also uh additionally I've made some changes in the code yesterday I will if if there is time in",
  "the code yesterday I will if if there is time in the end end of the session I will share my screen I will show you some all the things which I have changed in the we have another you know another Contender for sharing the screen is also ready to share the screen so I I afraid that we will get the time to debug this error in this live session because then it will be just touching it too far so if we are not able to solve it now then we can take it tomorrow as well do have tomorrow uh we can",
  "it tomorrow as well do have tomorrow uh we can schedule one yeah sir uh in the eth question last yesterday Ive tried in eth question it is working on Chrome but when I whenever I posted the URL on the graded assignment it is saying bad post or bad request kind of thing it is not working in the assignment but it it was working on the Chrome okay there might be problem with the way uh your system is interacting so it instead of the host it may be local host or something okay we'll uh yeah we can",
  "local host or something okay we'll uh yeah we can do one thing actually I will try to debug this error and give get give a response to you by tomorrow but if you're unable to do that and if we require you to you know actually share your screen then we can do something that I can create a separate meeting for you and then we will yes sir it will be very nice sir because sir just this fast API thing I'm not getting it it will it always giving me some error again and again with every questions so",
  "error again and again with every questions so as fast AP is it giving you an error specifically when you are using vers or is it like giving you an error whenever you are running it on local machine as well sir whenever I'm running on my local machine whenever I open that link it will say something uh it will say not found me method not allowed or kind of the questions which contains this solution fast API and kind of posting request or getting request from the URL it is not working that's why",
  "request from the URL it is not working that's why I'm not able to understand it how to do it or how to debug it that's why all right s we will like have a look into it and then I'll okay thank you okay so now we have verified that there is only one a table now we can go ahead with the rest of the code now within table what we need to do we need to go to every single row so I will just identify the rules I think this would be within TD uh this should be okay this is the one so let's copy the",
  "should be okay this is the one so let's copy the selector and okay this is the selector no no no I don't want this um okay I will create so rows is equal to table of zero and then again use select and within select we need uh TR with ranking list ranking hyphen list so this is the class that we need to select and this is how we can get the header but I'm not interested in getting header we want TR tag now within TR tag the second TD is what we need so this rows stores all the rows I want to",
  "need so this rows stores all the rows I want to iterate through each of the row and now um is there any mistake oh in rows so we want TD is equal to row dot uh s uh not soup select and that is DD is what we need to select and actually we are interested in selecting second TD element that have name so let us just select the second one and this have name and I won't call it name because we already have one name parameter over here and let's just print it name. text content maybe this might get",
  "print it name. text content maybe this might get the name let me run it again and this should print it but instead of going over all of these rows maybe I can just restrict to one row so this should be one to two I think this would restrict to one row okay we have sent one request but there is nothing on the to find SGD H you have sent the request for the name SG yeah that is okay yeah okay okay um oh oh oh it should be anim do text but again it won't be able to find it right no no right now",
  "it won't be able to find it right no no right now I'm not going to find it I I just want to print it but we have okay got it got I want to what I looking yeah I got it got it basically we want this name right first So within this second DD element we want the text content so I think that's but I'm not able to get it so let me just print uh maybe it's not going inside pH um maybe okay let me go through all the rows instead of one of them ah it's not printing perhaps there is nothing inside this",
  "not printing perhaps there is nothing inside this Rose let me just print this Rose list once okay I got I got it I got it that is because we are using wrong Cherry selector so it should be TR do ranking list and I think now it should work okay it's getting n so it's able to pass inside the row but it's not able to find the TD so that part is working but this anime part is not working um that is because it doesn't okay let's have a look at why it's not working okay uh I'll probably if you leave",
  "not working okay uh I'll probably if you leave this recorded right in the TDS playlist it will be there right yeah yeah it will be there so it have each of these individual TD tags so it is actually getting there but it doesn't have anything text content so where is the name of uh okay let's go to the first one it's very long uh within image or maybe this one yeah I think this is actually an anchor tag right it's an anchor tag and yes it's an anchor tag with a class of hover info trigger H but",
  "tag with a class of hover info trigger H but I'm just just to verify that there is only one anchor tag okay there are multiple anchor tags with h input yeah okay so this is one anchor tag then this is another anchor tag over here I think is there any anchor tag h no no it is for image so we need to get this anchor tag for hover and Discord trigger we can look this uh this way in this in the H3 element having the class anime ranking H3 and then inside that we have an anchor tag and then we have",
  "that we have an anchor tag and then we have to find the okay sure so with this we want anime. select underscore one uh there is only one H3 tag right yes of course H3 and do we need to apply some class yeah there is Anime ranking H3 yeah we should apply this this this particular class the last one right yeah yeah this last one and this should get it two classes over here H you have passed two classes two classes no we have passed only one class no no no H3 f WP and Anime ranking two classes oh",
  "no no no H3 f WP and Anime ranking two classes oh okay so let's just keep this third one and now let's print H3 and now within this this is the name I think okay now within this we want um anchor tag so I will put if you want anchor tag and text then iner text i n n e r okay let's execute it again must be a selector before it combinator selector at position this must be a selector before it maybe I have to remove this P okay it's none n none okay instead of doing inner text let's just to till",
  "instead of doing inner text let's just to till okay uh this is Anchor tag and now is it in text or text content okay again it gets us none uh okay let me ask GPT uh from this how do I get okay maybe because we are trying to extract it in wrong way maybe this is correct one uh I yet [Music] using uh dot text text okay now we are getting the name now we just need to compare that name I think we have already you know shown how you can actually do this and yeah yeah I think we can skip ahead to's",
  "this and yeah yeah I think we can skip ahead to's question sure sure sure yeah Hara please ask your question hello yeah hi uh you want to share the screen yes please go ahead you see my screen yeah screen is visible okay so regarding the scope I want that it's too broad so I just want to so first thing is actually like uh okay so this one currently here the tool is prettier maybe you give some other tool here then how do I install it like uh uh is there a subset of tools which you will be uh",
  "is there a subset of tools which you will be uh looking for then maybe I can have it installed as part of the locker build process uh you can let us know like what's the subset of tools here which you're looking for and the second part is in this question is the file type here is MD like uh maybe here the parameter can change to python so if that is the case then this is python then there is python equivalent uh formatting tool so if this is so what's the scope of this file type and what's the",
  "what's the scope of this file type and what's the scope of this uh uh formatting tool like what's the subset of it these two okay yeah so regarding this installation part maybe whatever needs to be installed whatever is defined here you can install those those within Docker build but if there are something that needs to be installed for some other task so there might be some new task right for that you might have to install something that that is not mentioned here so for that you can install",
  "is not mentioned here so for that you can install those things while running the manuscript no you cannot install like that actually like a Docker Docker process when it is running right it will have limited privileges so uh how do you install that actually like and then make it for examp while running the minus script you can use sub processes to install no sub process also has limitations stalker process doesn't have like a to install there you can check it out okay okay we'll check that out",
  "can check it out okay okay we'll check that out okay what is the like very broad okay so this one um like when is the ETA for getting back on this like uh like how do you like tomorrow can you disclose like what's the action point you can do one thing you can post this on discourse once and then we will actually like I don't want to go through that I do not know that this course but in any case actually like I can send out a mail actually if I get get a response it would be great discourage you",
  "get a response it would be great discourage you know we discourage sending mails because when you are posting on this course when to help then maybe you can post in that chat what's the discour link I can go there and uh yeah that would be helpful please post wait link yeah A4 this one uh so here so you have a input this is one parameter the second is actually you have a list of criterias so maybe last name first name and then XY Z ABC zdf or Alpha Beta whatever actually like so uh this can be",
  "Beta whatever actually like so uh this can be variable number of arguments right actually like so this is an array so is there any limit for this like maybe like is it like actually like reasonable like within 10 I can expect or within four or five like Hello uh it should be reasonable list it should not be too long so and the other one is actually like uh um do you expect anything like actually sort and then unique like or is it just sort is the command pattern here like uh can it be sought",
  "the command pattern here like uh can it be sought and then unique like or maybe s or maybe you change the operation itself like actually like maybe you want something else like uh that I'm not aware about like who is preparing this SRS Anan s is preparing this where is he like like uh where is he like how do we contact him again we will encourage you to you know use discourse Anan s you know he's frequently active over there he response to students and uh what you can do is simply go ahead to",
  "and uh what you can do is simply go ahead to this course post all your problems you are facing with and then you can you know simply it's not problems like it's the requirements itself actually yeah yeah absolutely so these are okay any this is getting uh like okay so this is A4 and the other one is uh A6 okay so this is again one more broad parameters like see file type is MD so like okay the level one kind of uh hurdles is actually like for file type MD you can have H1 header or you can have",
  "type MD you can have H1 header or you can have para you can have table you can have any kind of like in a mark down actually like the grammar is like too many elements like at least eight or 10 has so we need to have a tool for this kind of a thing and then extract only that section out of it if it's H1 H2 whatever they are asking for that's the L1 L2 is actually like level two is actually you change the data type the file type itself from Mark maybe you can make it as some other type and then",
  "maybe you can make it as some other type and then extract subsection so how much level is the scope of this like it's too broad it's just too broad uh SOA all these questions I don't have you don't neither Shan have exact answer to it because no actually sandx is there any sandbox how is the testing mechanism here like uh uh like is there any sandbox here well Hara uh you know these question related to how what are they expecting and what are so how are these things being evaluated so these are",
  "how are these things being evaluated so these are out of our control so these assignments are being prepared by an and yeah so he's preparing those assignments and the way you can you know actually contact him is through discourse so create a discourse post tag him on that discourse post tag USS as well if there is some ambiguity or if there is something uh you know if there is something you know confusing then we can actually get together and solve those issues so actually every Wednesday we",
  "solve those issues so actually every Wednesday we have yeah but it's not it's on the trying to ask you're trying to clarify some doubts but again that if these doubts are being raised and there is a level of ambiguity in the questions and you know we the questions are unable to answer the questions are unable to explain themselves so that's an issue and that we have to you know sit with the instructor and you know can we bring him uh to the meeting like can we bring that stakeholder here like",
  "like can we bring that stakeholder here like uh who I do not know him but can you bring him actually like maybe can there be one discussion you see there are two things like one is like I'm new to this process like actually like last semester we did something called as mad project it was very organized one is like actually you had a Sandbox like whenever you submit something actually like you have a way to test that project or anything like that actually like so you can test it out and then",
  "actually like so you can test it out and then it'll tell you what is the score and then here uh since there is no QA so the requirements actually there's only requirements there is no testing criteria at all actually like so like both the ends then only like it is a proper approach we have a goal otherwise goal is like actually you can we can enhance this goal to anything like I can have a auto disk document and auto dis document to pass it it is like very different actually so each file type",
  "is like very different actually so each file type is like maybe I can have a brender file I can have anything I want so the scope of this document actually so it should be restricted only by the QA guy so that is the first thing and second thing is actually like they used to bring in the experts actually like who were we used to have that meeting so if the person who is designing this if he can come for a meeting that would be great actually like uh if you can if you guys can arrange or we can",
  "uh if you can if you guys can arrange or we can uh I can ask that in the discour as well as it or like you guys can communicate actually like how is the mechanism there so Hara that's a really good suggestions and perhaps we can talk with him and you know kind of set up a new a meeting with uh with the students where he but the but the but the thing is that he's much active on discourse and and I I just shared a link if you just yeah yeah I saw that okay so I I shared another link as offline",
  "that okay so I I shared another link as offline way that I I totally agree but actually like uh I like face to face much more but uh anyways actually I'll post them and then we'll see but please arrange face to face meeting yeah once but but just go through that link once and so multiple students have have asked multiple questions right over there and perhaps someone has asked the question which you are asking okay and they might have got the answer and you you know you may get your answer as",
  "and you you know you may get your answer as well so just go through that you know thread once which the link I have shared just now okay yeah and I'll just go through this see this A8 right actually this image the mini file uh the what is that actually like uh uh the model which we are using it's like a very lowlevel model actually like uh it is not uh like for other things it's working for this one and all it's working for an image data actually like uh it is giving like U object is not Json",
  "like uh it is giving like U object is not Json reasonable but actually like if I try to use some other model it perfectly works the same line of C same code works so this uh this has a limitation like actually like even it is explained in that model itself that actually like for image type actually it will give you this error so for that particular thing um like how do we like actually like uh U uh like uh so for that particular thing actually they asking to use llm itself so that has a",
  "they asking to use llm itself so that has a limitation the second way of doing this alternate way is you can use a TCT uh so are we allowed to use TCT actually like that is one more thing which I need actually like uh um uh and uh uh the other one is actually like um you guys have answers to none of the questions or like anyone like uh I'll just go through them actually like if you guys have answered to some of them also it would be helpful anyways I'll post it but um I'll just go through the",
  "I'll post it but um I'll just go through the other one also A9 U this is actually the output is only two right this is uh obvious right is that true the output is only two lines hello you asking about the output the yeah output is just two lines right similar pair of compents means there's only two lines right actually here output one per line one comment per line again we have to get this one okay yeah yeah and is there any states like what I mean is actually this looks like a command design",
  "mean is actually this looks like a command design pattern so like there there is something like undo redo are they expecting because the reason being you see the data outside accessed is SL data is never accessed so if he asks anywhere like anything like slash MNT or something like that we should not process it that's fine but then there is a a protocol here like actually like one is a post one is a get so I think they're validating using get this is doing the manipulation this is doing the get",
  "is doing the manipulation this is doing the get operation to check whether the status is correct or not so here what is the return type for this for B1 and B2 what's the return return type like uh if it is not access that means actually like no operation has been done what is the format for this thing actually like for the get and even for this also like what should be the format um that is uh other actually like uh and here also it's very Vue actually what is this API is it graphql is it rest",
  "what is this API is it graphql is it rest API is it corba call or is it soap API what kind of call is it actually like um and how do you like actually so and this one actually if you have permission issue what what kind of response do we need actually like this is also until here the scope was still SQL light but here one more new database comes in dark DB so if you put in R then I can have in Oracle database or anything like actually red also like so what is this actually like so U the scope",
  "like so what is this actually like so U the scope is it cql or no SQL what is the scope here actually like and uh so there are so many questions this is like actually and the this is the level two level one is something okay level two is little abstract level three is even more abstract that is actually like we may pass additional task beyond the list what does it mean beyond the list means what does it mean like uh it can be anything or like I mean there is no at least here at least there was",
  "mean there is no at least here at least there was some format here is there's no format like uh so this is the level three so these are the questions which I hand remaining I have completed this coding but uh actually I've done these things but it's like actually can work for one way actually like you can make the same code not to work for one way because there's always a limitation for whatever code you do it's only based on the requirement so if the requirs expand then the code won't work",
  "so if the requirs expand then the code won't work right so um this thing has been done okay this are all have been done but anyways actually I need Clarity for this I'll post it but uh if you guys have answer right away please answer otherwise uh please set up a meeting and then we'll have a offline way of discussing also through this course so uh we understand that there is a kind of ambiguity in these questions and you know you sound like a guy who has a lot of experience in these kind of",
  "guy who has a lot of experience in these kind of things and that's really good that you're raising these questions and uh it will you know help us resolve these ambiguities in the future also we will raise these queries with Anan and we will you know demand answers regarding these uh how can we solve these uh problems and we'll get back to you also uh you know uh it's uh it's like uh you are asking you you came here with a you know you came here with an expectation of C clarifying your doubts",
  "with an expectation of C clarifying your doubts and we are kind of not we not able to do that at the moment so that's uh the kind of apologize for that and uh we will get back to you soon and uh we'll try to solve your thank you thank you so much and uh the other one is actually yeah this one actually just remember this is a cicd pipeline I think he's guessing like that actually he wants to mimic this so usually there'll be undo redo and all like so what kind of yeah anyways please take that",
  "so what kind of yeah anyways please take that and thank you so much actually like I appreciate that uh we will go so the action steps are two things one is offline please try to arrange that actually I am assuming he's like a product manager something like that so if he comes in that would be he actually the thing is that he's also the CEO of a company of a MNC so the thing is he is a busy guy but he no actually NBA from I am Bangalore okay actually like I am also you see everybody has",
  "actually like I am also you see everybody has everything actually you can't I'm not saying stakeholder actually like I would appreciate him actually if you can arrange it it would be great otherwise we'll try the offline way okay uh this is I'm I'm not claiming that he is uh you know he's is a busy guy and hence he won't be able to answer the questions yeah thing is that he you know he's active sometimes but some most of the times he's unable to answer that's fine actually please try it",
  "to answer that's fine actually please try it actually like everybody if they want to make time they can make time that's all actually like and uh even if I lose marks I don't worry but at least let since we are putting effort let it be in a proper way that's all actually I'm asking for okay that is all I had thank you so much all right uh Hara uh please make sure that whatever ambiguities and whatever doubts you have please create a you know long discourse post about that and post it on the",
  "long discourse post about that and post it on the link I just gave you because then it will be you know it will help us to ask those questions to on answer and uh then we we'll be actually able to solve these questions okay so please pour in all your doubts all your uh questions you have regarding these uh during this project into this course post and just posted tag each and every one of us tag an tag me tag J tag tagging can put that your email ID is because I don't not I'm sorry I do not",
  "ID is because I don't not I'm sorry I do not know your you guys actually like I will just give you uh I will just give you the usern names you can use so if you just put in yeah if you just put in an adate and then type in these uh usernames then you will be able to yeah just put yeah that's enough actually just put the names uh yeah that would be good actually like and uh I'll create a new thread actually this seems to be some other thread so I create a thank you thank you so much have a nice",
  "create a thank you thank you so much have a nice evening by J can you please clarify can you please just check if these are the on okay uh it is s do an instead of an okay it's s do s all right Hasa thank you for pointing out these ambiguities thank you please make sure you post the discourse post okay yeah sure on on this link which I shared shared so this is an exclusive link for project one yeah okay so tomorrow you said there a call so I I think there is nothing in the calendar I see but",
  "think there is nothing in the calendar I see but maybe if it's ad hoc call actually like which you guys are posting maybe can I expect something in tomorrow's call actually like or else I won't attend attend next week so just want a heads up like uh you think within one day the response will be there uh I will recommend you to join the live sessions from next week and uh because in this week we are aiming to complete the gf4 okay okay join from next week that would be much more better and that",
  "next week that would be much more better and that will give us time to resolve these errors thank you thank you take care all right all right bye guys only only one person is remaining all let's",

  "mhm I felt that the first assignment was pretty easy second was hard and third was average and this seems easy all right so uh I know that's been that's going to be a you know General case for everyone I assume uh except that first one because you I assume that you might be from the from technical background so that's why you're saying that the first GA was easy and in fact it was but for the majority of our students in PDS it was like you know hitting a hammer uh on someone's head so it was",
  "hitting a hammer uh on someone's head so it was really hard for each and every so for for the majority of students so it was really hard but uh what we can what you can actually expect is that the level of difficulty of TDS assignments is going to reduce a bit okay as these GS progress so they will keep on decreasing decreasing decreasing and uh you know G4 is a you know good way to testify that okay so it's a really it's comparatively compare when you're going to compare this G with other G so",
  "you're going to compare this G with other G so it's really an you know an easy task to do okay uh most of that is because the things which are being asked in this G have been completed have been you know T to you in live either in live sessions or in different or in previous weeks okay so let's get start with this G and uh in the last session yesterday we completed these three topics right so we were able to import HTML into Google shets then we were able to scrap MDB so so we didn't actually",
  "were able to scrap MDB so so we didn't actually scrape IMDb we actually scraped uh my anim list so that's another website where you can you know find a ranking of something so we did this and we actually so what was interesting about this question was that we were able to extract the data using three different methods right and uh uh if you guys haven't seen that live session but y's live session I would recommend you to you know see that just go and watch that particular section of that live",
  "go and watch that particular section of that live session so it was a really interesting task we did we actually use three different types of data scraping methods okay yeah it's been uploaded today and moreover I can't understand why you guys waiting for it to be uploaded just go to your calendar go to your IM the calendar which isoated with your itbs uh ID just go over here so this is last last this is yesterday's session just click on this and then you'll be able to see this live session",
  "and then you'll be able to see this live session okay and uh I guess this is this live session uh it's uploaded so actually take Google takes actually about you know hour an hour or a two to process this video footage and then it will you know will just you know it will push it to your each and every you know calendar and then you can simply watch this from okay you you don't have to wait for us to upload it to go to YouTube okay so this is one way okay so let's get started with our fourth",
  "one way okay so let's get started with our fourth question okay and what the fourth and what the fourth question is let's get to it so over here we are actually going to introduce you guys with BBC weather location okay so BBC actually have an entire so they have a weather API okay and in fact they have many more apis as well so BBC stands for I guess British it was something like that so is British Broadcasting something c stand for something else okay so uh they have multiple apis working for",
  "okay so uh they have multiple apis working for them okay one of these apis is you know location ID detector and then then there is weather API as well so these guys have yeah so it is British Broadcasting Corporation right thank you carton so these uh they have multiple apis working for them and they are required to use these apis to actually uh get what we design okay so the question over here it says that uh so obviously in my casee it's thean for you it must be something okay so for this uh",
  "for you it must be something okay so for this uh let's do this once okay I will try to extract uh I won't do it for so uh okay so uh what we will do is we won't be I won't be you know extracting I won't be doing everything I will I will just you know show you the way how to do this okay and uh let's say I want to do this for Delhi okay so tan is actually the capital of Iran and I won't be doing this because obviously so I will be extracting the data for 10 right so let's get started what are we",
  "for 10 right so let's get started what are we going to do is so if you just read this your task you will be able to see that firstly you have to you know get the location ID of the city okay and for that we have a location service right so this is the location API of PPC yeah so this is the specific end point which is used to extract the location ID of Mumbai okay yes uh can you redo that step s where you went over I just CLI over okay okay okay so this is actually an example uh an example link",
  "so this is actually an example uh an example link which has been given to you just click over here and then it will just redirect you okay now what I will do is it's pretty simple simply copy this okay now you have two options okay actually you have three options in fact you have multiple options to be honest okay so one option can be you can use Thunder CL okay so what is thunder C so you guys must know about how you can send you know API requests using python okay so for that we actually",
  "using python okay so for that we actually import request library and then we are then it allows us to send that data that a but in this case we can do something so actually V provides us with this extension with and the name of this this extension is thunder PL and it actually sends these API requests on your behalf to that API inform Okay so you can simply go to this extensions tab search for Thunder clim and then you will be able to download okay so that's how you can download this okay so",
  "okay so that's how you can download this okay so you can just simply click on Thunder CL otherwise you can use Postman as well so Postman is another software which has been developed to you know facilit requesting apis requesting the data from apis okay so this is actually a really simple application which will send API requests on your behalf right so uh you can just simply download Postman from Google that's pretty easy okay and it's it just gives you an entire you Ur to use okay so what I",
  "gives you an entire you Ur to use okay so what I will do is I will simply paste what I copied from uh Google and now you can see that it has arranged all these parameters in a really beautiful thing okay and what I will do is can you see this local oh sorry can you see this s parameter right so I assume this s stands for search okay this is just a short form for search that's why it's okay so you can see that it's in this s parameter we have Mumbai right so what I will do is simply I will write",
  "right so what I will do is simply I will write okay simple and I will send this and let's wait for it okay so it hased okay uh no response let's check more okay so it's giving us for Mumbai but it's not giving us for Delhi let's try New Delhi instead of Delhi okay let's R okay so it's it's G for new Del but [Music] not so so so in this in this Json response you can see that we have an entire you know we have this entire Json response now what you can do is you will see that over here in this ID",
  "can do is you will see that over here in this ID uh in this ID key you have this API you have this so was the location ID yeah so we have this location ID right just copy it from here okay pretty simple now head back to our TDS page and now you now you just now we have we going to actually follow this second instruction that's going to us okay and now it says that retrieve the weather forecast data using the obtained location ID so we have a location ID and then and now we can use the weather",
  "ID and then and now we can use the weather all right so again pretty simple just go here and here you can see that this is the just zoom it once so here you can see that we have this BBC weather scraping uh not this we have this BBC weather API okay so simply click over here and now it's running something and as you can see that this this API Endo is working for Mumbai okay so mumbai's uh location ID was this okay this is actually mumbai's location ID and over here what it's doing is it's just",
  "ID and over here what it's doing is it's just pasting the location ID of a city and just press enter okay so this is how this API import actually works okay uh after this aggregated uh this aggregated value then you just have to put a hash put a slash and then put the location ID of the pretty right so overhead you can see that we have received something okay and you can see that this is an array this is an array of l 10 actually and in this we have multiple uh okay so it's lagging so this",
  "we have multiple uh okay so it's lagging so this actually happens uh when the J when the Jon response is pretty big okay so I never recommend you guys to actually open these Json files it's aggregated right so maybe it's for a lot of days or something yeah probably so it's uh it's going to give you for a lot of dates and uh yeah just not responding okay I guess I have to close Google to close Google meet as well okay okay it's back I got it Clos on its own okay so always remember this that",
  "Clos on its own okay so always remember this that always refrain from actually opening these Json objects in your Google Chrome So Google I guess it's not comp it's not capable of opening these gantic GSM objects okay and just crashes okay so in my case I was saved I just I was able to click on the cross button pretty quickly that's why I got saved otherwise would have crashed okay so always remember this so what I will do is simply click over here quickly copy this link then head back to",
  "here quickly copy this link then head back to postman okay so Postman will never betray you like Google okay so simply run this send this request and now you can see that we have the weather forecast of multiple teams okay I guess there is a summary as well and then okay so we have detailed uh reports of each dat so I guess yeah so we have multi so okay so have detailed reports of multiple okay that's why it's a pretty large file are you plugged in because it looks like you're about to run out",
  "in because it looks like you're about to run out of battery oh yeah thank you second all right so uh this was actually for mobile so what you have to do simple just uh delete this location ID and paste your delhi's location okay pretty simple send it and and now you will get the you will get the weather for da new actually okay so this is how you will do approach this question all right so I won't be showing you how to actually you know get into this JSM object and extract the required",
  "get into this JSM object and extract the required information because that's pretty simple again we just have to iterate over this reports uh key so this reports key contains the data for each and every you know uh for the required dates and you just have to you know iterate over this particular list okay so it's pretty simple and JJ has you know uh explained this bit in a in a really elaborate manner so if you guys have problems in you know accessing the Json objects then you can anytime go to",
  "the Json objects then you can anytime go to any the to those live sessions uh otherwise you can you know just simply ask CH so that's one of the you know best ways to get your doubts clarified Okay so so that was it can you like it will be helpful s if you can give the reference where like uh which week in particular he has explained this one like last I guess it was uh it was the second the second Li of DS in this term uh yeah I guess it was like covering which G so that I can it was first G",
  "covering which G so that I can it was first G okay okay okay the first yeah otherwise you can simply go to rather than searching which G had that particular clip explaining this you can just simply go to otherwise simply Google it so this is a Json object Json objects are nothing but Pyon disar okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah so so so so it's just KN just knowing the whole thing about Json thing okay because is it the same object which we have used in ga3 as absolutely absolutely okay okay okay",
  "in ga3 as absolutely absolutely okay okay okay okay the Json objects are nothing but python dictionaries so you can simply access them any okay so in the same manner you access dictionaries so you can access them as all right so that was it for this question any questions regarding this so yeah so like I'm not having that kind of experience with Json I'm just copy pasting those AI things I'm getting from chat Bots and co-pilots or CH GBS so what should I ideally do like how to understand Json",
  "should I ideally do like how to understand Json and their logic behind everything we are doing look Json it's nothing but a dictionary a python dictionary say all right so Jason is you you you you you probably know about paries right correct so when let's say Json are nothing but like python dictionaries turned into a data storage okay so uh python dictionary so it's like you know your python dictionaries are storing some kind of data and that's Jason all right nothing else ason stands for you",
  "Jason all right nothing else ason stands for you know it it has a pretty big uh full form uh JavaScript object uh notation that that that but it's a pretty simple thing it's just python dictionaries which are storing your data all right so it's it's nothing fancy it's pretty it's just python dictionary you can simply access these gson files in the same manner you access your P so let's say if I want to enter this uh forecast how would I do it in Python can you tell me how would I do it this how",
  "Python can you tell me how would I do it this how would I you know reach this reports key in Python let's I have this this gon object right so how can I reach this reports key and get the value of this one in Python just assume this is not a Json object this is a python dictionary all right how can I do it any idea anyone this question is not only it's not access as to like should I answer maybe it's better if the person who having a doubt answer yeah sure yeah sure yeah sure please answer see",
  "yeah sure yeah sure yeah sure please answer see it's just like reports we have to access we have to see reports is uh within which entity right so reports within detailed and detailed is within forecast so we are accessing this forecast uh thing then within that we have to access the key which is detailed within this we have to access reports then if else inside it we have to access we have to just see which what what key uh it is having and then we have to just do that exactly so let me just",
  "we have to just do that exactly so let me just copy this to python that would be much more easier for you guys to understand okay so it will give me turn off errors because obviously haven't copied the entire dictionary okay so right here and this okay so I just you know type A Pudo code instead of rectifying this entire okay so how can you access this let's say this is stored in this variable which is let's say it is okay or let's call it uh weather right so this is a weather variable how you",
  "right so this is a weather variable how you can access these reports it's pretty simple weather forecasts all right so just like a python Tex nothing else all right so as you can see that codm or you know G copilot will just auto complete this for you okay and you can see that we actually are able to get those data okay okay okay so all right so this was it for this question any questions for do you guys have any other questions or should we move ahead I guess not okay so let's get ahead with",
  "ahead I guess not okay so let's get ahead with nominating okay so if you guys have been you know regularly attending these live sessions so uh you guys might remember that we I actually I use this API back at back in the you know very you know it was across third or fourth live session and I actually demonstrated how you can use nomina over there okay so what does nominative stand for what does Nom nominative eBay actually do so it's used for extracting the you know geolocation data of a",
  "for extracting the you know geolocation data of a particular place okay so that's what nominatim stands for I know that this name nominatim it's not much resonating with the uh with the task it's used for but uh we have what okay so this nor so this I will give you a really simple demonstration for this okay let me okay it is it is let's SE for nominating nomina API and here you can just look into these this documentation okay okay let me see how it was okay okay okay all right so I will head",
  "it was okay okay okay all right so I will head back to to post man okay so always whenever you're trying to you know if you don't if you don't want to write python pythonic code for Ping API end points API GSM object so simply install Postman for this simply use Postman otherwise you can use H gr as well all right so that's much efficient way uh to you know actually see what do this particular API end point actually return okay so this is the API end point for nominative and over here I will",
  "API end point for nominative and over here I will create few parameters okay so we have to pass few parameters and I guess it was q and then uh we have to write the name of the particular place we want to search it for okay uh let's do Del okay again let's do for Deli uh all right and I'll create another one which will have this format parameter okay what does this format mean I just explain in a while let okay okay so nominative has actually returned me a list which contains multiple you know",
  "me a list which contains multiple you know objects all right so why does it do that I will just explain you in a okay so how does this API input actually works so this is the end point by the way and here we are actually passing on the parameters okay so this Q parameter is the query parameter okay so Q stands for query now in this Q parameter you just have to write what the name of the location you you actually want to search for all right and in this format parameter we are telling nominating",
  "this format parameter we are telling nominating that which in which format we are expecting this uh this uh return object this response object to the return all right so I guess if you enter XML it will return you in XML as well let's check it all right so if you enter XML so it will be returning you this this entire data in XML as well okay so uh because we want Json and we're not dealing with xmls at the moment obviously they will be introduced to you a while in further weeks but at the",
  "to you a while in further weeks but at the moment we are dealing with Json files okay so we have received a Json file okay okay so you can see that in this so we have received an array okay so this is an array as you can see this is a list okay and in this list we have multiple dictionaries okay I'll be using the word dictionary instead of objects okay uh so in this in these dictionar we have multiple uh in this in this list we have multiple di right now you can see that you can see this name",
  "right now you can see that you can see this name okay so I search for Delhi that's why it's giving me the objects for Delhi okay so we have this name uh if you scroll on a it you will see that we have multiple uh object we have multiple dictionaries which have this name ke as Del so why is it why is it doing this so why is it not know Del is a city so why is it not returning just one dictionary which contains the information for tell the particular City why is it doing this because in",
  "particular City why is it doing this because in nominative you can actually search for not only a city but for a restaurant as well if I'm not wrong okay so you can search for a restaurant as well in nominated and it will return you the the the information about that about the name the about the restaurant it contains in so let's say uh perhaps it won't return the location of your nearby you know mosa okay because that's something which has not been you know documented in its uh database so uh",
  "been you know documented in its uh database so uh let's say if I want to search for McDonald's okay let's search for Delhi and McDonald's okay okay let's hope it works and I believe nomin actually has okay so it's not working let's search for m just McDonald's okay so we have received uh I assume that it's going to be a very okay so all right okay so we have received information about McDonald's and okay so it's an Amity so in this class you can actually see that what kind of uh location is",
  "can actually see that what kind of uh location is this okay so as you can see that is an amenity and it belongs to the typ Reston Okay so you can in fact you can search for your restaurants you can search for you know your streets you can search for landmarks you can search for anything in nomin all right but at the moment we'll be focusing on tell okay okay so in each of these uh dictionaries you can see that we have multiple Keys multiple key and value right we have this latitudes we have the",
  "value right we have this latitudes we have the longitudes and then obviously we have a class and then we have the type of this location so it's administrative okay and uh yeah so in this address type you can actually see that it's a city it's a state it's it's been that Delhi has been placed in a category of State okay if you scroll down you can see that the difference between these two objects is that the address typ is actually Village over here so perhaps there is a village somewhere in the",
  "so perhaps there is a village somewhere in the world named Delhi okay and surprisingly it's located in the United States okay so just magnify I can okay so there is actually a a village by the name of De in the United strees Okay so that's a new thing for me as well okay uh okay so we have another uh okay so we have another city in Us by the name of Delhi okay and let's scroll down more okay so we have another Village by the name of uh Village of Deli okay uh in the town of Deli of tare County",
  "Deli okay uh in the town of Deli of tare County New York United States okay so you know Delhi is not exclusive to India you have multiple around okay and the same can be you know understood for other names as well let's say if I want to search for udur Okay so udur is a city which is you know located in Rajasthan so it's a pretty famous city of udur but also buur is located in tripura as well okay you can see that for the very first response we have got so it's buur and it's located in",
  "we have got so it's buur and it's located in Rajasthan fa that's good uh again it's Ur and it's located in Rajasthan but you can see that Ur is also a a town so it's a town actually it's located in tripura as well okay so this is how you can actually you know you know you can if you are if you want to you know know about uh these uh things you can just simply use nomina for okay simply just search something and perhaps you might be able to know you know Amaze your so uh finding Delhi in United",
  "you know Amaze your so uh finding Delhi in United States was was a pretty you know amazing thing which for me personally and uh yeah you can have a lot of fun with nominating okay so uh this was an introduction of nominatim and you can do you know a fair amount of things with this so also in this question we have asked you guys to actually give the bounding box so what's the bounding box now if you go over here you will see that each of these Diaries contains a key with the name bounding box",
  "Diaries contains a key with the name bounding box okay so what does this pounding box actually means so uh we I will open paint over here okay explain you guys okay so let's say that uh let's do this okay so uh let's say uh this is my city or that's town this is my town okay this is Town TDS okay so this is Town TDS okay now what does a bounding box actually mean a bounding box is nothing but the it's something like this okay so if I draw it more precisely it should be something like this okay",
  "precisely it should be something like this okay so this time I've have got it perfectly so a bounding box is something like this okay and it actually you know it's a box which encapsulates the entire place okay and over here in this bounding box you have given you have been given these four values what do what do these four values actually mean so these are I guess that these are actually the latitude and longitudes of these Corner points okay so these Corner points so if you get the location",
  "so these Corner points so if you get the location if you get this these latitudes and longitudes of these points just if you get the latitudes and longitudes for these points you can draw this box right so this is how bounding box actually works okay and it's it's nothing but it's nothing it's nothing but uh you know a box which encapsulate that that c area Okay so uh this was it about nominative any questions regarding this any question guys over here in this question that we have been asked",
  "here in this question that we have been asked they have asked is that what is the minimum latitude of the Bing box of City poron okay so you can just search for poron it will give you the bounding box and you have to check that which is which one is the you know minimum latitude okay so uh this concludes the part of nting any questions or should we move ahead all right I guess uh there are no further questions so let's move in okay so uh now we will be seeing uh what is this Hacker News API",
  "we will be seeing uh what is this Hacker News API does okay so this Hacker News API is actually used to so hacker news is I guess it's a a platform where technical information is being you know it's regularly updated so every new technical advancement in any other field in any related field would be published over here okay so this is like a it's like a news platform kind of okay and they have an actual API for this okay let's explore that API so this is the API and okay so in this question we",
  "this is the API and okay so in this question we have been asked that we have to find the newest news the newest news regarding something so we have been given this keyword so for me it's 2fa for you it might be something else okay so we have to search we have to you know actually find something the newest that report the newest news regarding this particular keyword all right so how you can do this it's pretty simple okay so it's simply just copy it okay just close paint okay so just simply",
  "copy it okay just close paint okay so just simply copy it go back to just keep create a new request all right so just copy it to post auth or let's say if you are a python geek you might want to write an entire code for this okay so this in the python notebook okay now what you have to do you can see that how you can actually search beads okay simply you have to use this Q parameter with the keyword you want to search for right so over here what I will do I will create a new parameter so this",
  "I will do I will create a new parameter so this is how you can actually create new parameters right so uh if I just copy it from here and paste it right over here so you can see that this has Auto it has automatically data Ed that there is a parameter being used and it has filled this parameter right so if I just change it something so it will be changed in the URL as right so in this Q parameter what I have to pass on uh let's say I won't be you know searching for this 2fa I will be searching",
  "know searching for this 2fa I will be searching for something else let's say I want to search for deep seek okay because deep seek has been a lot of debates and you know now controversies as well so let's search for D all right so they have returned something okay so they have returned an entire page to us but we're not looking for a page we're actually looking for a Json object right so let's see if we are able to get it or not okay let me just open it in Google let's see okay so it's an XML",
  "open it in Google let's see okay so it's an XML file not a HTML file which okay so from this XML file uh we have to extract something right so what we have to do is we have to find the item the item tag in this XML and then we have to just get into that tag and find this link Okay so uh let's see if I can do something okay so all right so here is this item okay so here is this item tag and from this item tag you actually have to extract this link okay Str this what you can do is perhaps we can",
  "okay Str this what you can do is perhaps we can use Beautiful soap over here what is say carton can yeah this is perfect example to use beautiful so all right so uh let me open my you know Treasure of code for TDS so back when I was a student in TDS two terms back so I wrote these uh python files for my Roe okay so you can see that there are multiple files over there there is llm helpers location there is a entire code for nomin API as well okay so uh so when I was heading to towards Ro yeah so",
  "so uh so when I was heading to towards Ro yeah so you can access anything during Roe so you prepared entire set of absolutely I prepared everything okay so I before one or two days before Ro I was actually you know just making scripts making helpful scripts so during the RO I I did nothing but you know copy and paste these codes is already pregenerated PS and I was able to you know get a decent okay so I would recommend you you guys to you know if you are heading to Roe I would definitely",
  "know if you are heading to Roe I would definitely recommend you guys to do this can prepare your can get some of your code uh what can we get some of your code it's it's it's nothing like it's my Cod or just you know it's it's pretty basic stuff okay I didn't use anything much advance I just prepared some uh basic stuff so you can just create it yourself yes hey Ric one thing I'll say is every time we students ask us for this code that we write and keep okay but my suggestion is we I mean first",
  "keep okay but my suggestion is we I mean first of all we won't give it but there is a reason for that if we give you the code right when the Roe comes you won't know where the code is exactly because you have not but if you write it yourself when the RO comes there's no time to think but because you have written it yourself you will know exactly where to go and locate it instantly so that's why it's much better for you to write the code and keep it ready how to prepare for Roe then like with",
  "it ready how to prepare for Roe then like with the G we are practicing I'm going thoroughly with that we will have separate sessions for those okay so we'll not discuss that fine than thank you thank you sir okay yeah yeah please ask question we have a session for projects as well right it will be the the sessions related to project will be you know next week so all right all right because at first we have to focus on gf4 because the deadline is near uh yes sir exactly but uh we were having",
  "is near uh yes sir exactly but uh we were having like a bit problem while doing the projects that's why I asked if you're having some problems related to project one you can simply post it on this as well so that's another place where okay me carton sometimes un we are you know debugging errors and you know providing solutions to students simp go this course and we will answer you okay yes sir all right thank you all right okay so uh let's started with beautiful s so actually jaaj uh did a",
  "with beautiful s so actually jaaj uh did a pretty good job uh last uh live session where he you know gave an entire introduction to Beautiful s and how you can actually use it uh okay so I will be kind of repeating that stuff okay so okay okay I'll be creating a new file and the name name should be okay so I will name it beautiful soup so those of you who are not present last live session you can actually you know learn Beautiful soap right now okay and I have to install beautiful how how can",
  "okay and I have to install beautiful how how can you install beautiful so simple right click install and then beautiful soup and four yeah so this is how you actually install beautiful soup I will also I have to install the requests Library all right so uh these librar installed in the virtual environment okay so usually I prefer using virtual environments rather than you know running UV scripts because sometimes whenever you are actually first of all these UV scripts won't be you know they",
  "of all these UV scripts won't be you know they won't work when you using when you're using duper duper notebooks okay so they will only work with the python script so in that case if you're actually using the fter notebook then I would recommend you guys to create a virtual manra okay rather than actually using you trying to use U otherwise if you are using a python script a normal I file then you can simply you have an option you can use UV or otherwise you can use a virtual as well so me",
  "or otherwise you can use a virtual as well so me personally I prefer using virtual environments okay so let's get started I will import stuff so we'll be importing requests library then we'll be importing the beautiful suit Library so obviously our Podium is pretty intelligent to what kind of libraries I'm importing so for Beautiful soap it's pretty simple you have to uh the library's name uh it's bs4 okay so it's not entirely Beautiful soap for it's PS4 okay so from Beautiful soap you actually",
  "it's PS4 okay so from Beautiful soap you actually have to install some other stuff okay this is how you import it so from PS4 we are importing the Beautiful soap module okay I run it let's see okay so what you have to do is firstly we will be uh I I will be using my Roe code in this live S as well so you know it's helping me even now okay all right so as you might assume so from here we have to you know we have to send a request to a certain API and point right and for us that end point is this",
  "and point right and for us that end point is this one okay so what I will do run this and I will send a request so if you guys uh don't know yet so this is how you actually send API requests uh using python okay so it's pretty simple you just have to import this request library and then you have to uh you have to you know uh use this get module this get me not module it's a method you get method and then you have to just simply paste your url inside this particular right so this is how you get",
  "this particular right so this is how you get the you actually can fetch your API endpoints right so from this this is a page okay and now how can I access that XML code for that I guess text will work yeah text will work and or content should work as well so content is another method which will okay so it's something different in content so it's adding a b tag guess it's not a tag or something I will use text how to complicate things right so uh this is the entire XML file which was delivered",
  "this is the entire XML file which was delivered to us using uh as we saw so this is the entire XML file which you are able to see okay so what I will do is now I will use beautiful Su to pass this XML file and retrieve the required data okay let's head back to my code and let's use beautiful soup and again so how does beautiful soup actually works it's simply you have to write the name of the module then you have to so this page page so okay so this is the page all right so we have to pass the",
  "this is the page all right so we have to pass the content okay so this is the page which so this page variable actually contains the the response object which we which we actually received from okay and this this page is actually the entire the entire you know xtml content which we receive okay now we are putting we are you know passing this this XML content into this function along with another parameter which is HTML parer I doubt that this will work because we are actually dealing with XML",
  "work because we are actually dealing with XML let's see okay it worked then I will copy it from here all right so we have this okay so how you can actually know search something okay so what are you asking man you can always open your mic and talk to us because sometimes whenever we are teaching it's pretty difficult for us to know read these comments yeah thanks audio issues here uh but uh did you explain what's the difference between text and content uh if uh you could please help I did not",
  "content uh if uh you could please help I did not explain that and actually I have to look into it what's the difference between text and content but what I believe it is that uh text will kind of you know return a spring but the content it will it won't be a spring but uh it can be pared so that's my analogy so I will have to check it okay uh once so the difference between page and do text and do content okay okay thanks so let's so how does this soup how does how will this beautiful soup",
  "this soup how does how will this beautiful soup actually you know pass our entire okay so for this uh we have created this variable soup which actually contains this beautiful soup instance okay so now we can do anything with this XML using beautiful so right so uh what we did was I will just explain it in a kind of a summary so we just you know serve we just gave beautiful soup this entire XML content and now it will work for us okay so it will do the passing on our behalf right so let's",
  "will do the passing on our behalf right so let's search for the item tab okay and I guess we don't have any classes because XML if I'm not wrong they don't have any classes XML doesn't have any class so uh this should so this should work let's find out all right so it's working perfectly okay now from this from so what does what has this soup. find all item has has returned me so it has returned me the entire array so it's a list actually so I will be using the word list so it has returned me a",
  "be using the word list so it has returned me a list which contains all the instances of item tag being used in this XML okay so let's say if I wanted to search for let's say title tag okay so I will be searching for the title so as you can see that this is the title tag right I want to search the title tag let's go ahead and do that all right so you can see that we are able to get all these title tags and it has returned us the uh the you know the particular code for these tags okay and uh you",
  "particular code for these tags okay and uh you can see that these are actually the you know the titles of these articles being written on Hacker News about D DC okay so it's cheapest way to run GC R1 and a so the there are so these are the multiple articles that are being written okay so uh okay so uh this was how you can actually access these item these tags okay so I will be so for the sake of this question we have to use this item tag okay and from this item tag we have to fetch all the",
  "and from this item tag we have to fetch all the links if I'm not wrong I have to check that question once okay question once so we have to get all the link TXS okay so we we we don't have to get the links the specific links we have to get the link TX okay so this is our entire array which contains this data okay I can you know uh so this let's just store it into an variable a variable okay let's store it in item variable now what I will do is I will I will run I will I over this entire list and",
  "I will run I will I over this entire list and then I will print the text okay let's see what it okay so uh let's just you know uh all right so you can see that when I'm you know I'm iterating over this entire list of items what is it returning me it's actually rning me all those items all the all those item tags which are present in this XML right so uh okay so now I want to find the link tags which are present in the items okay so this iton tags actually contains these link tags as well I want",
  "actually contains these link tags as well I want to find that how can I do it anyone can anyone just help me in finding these link tags somehow I just open your mic and just tell me how I can do they are the a tag right uh there's a link tag actually H that's that's the link tag only but that it has a No actually that's true for that's true for HTML in XML you can create your own TS okay so this Al tag I believe it doesn't exist in HTML okay this description tag it doesn't exist in HTML right",
  "description tag it doesn't exist in HTML right so in XML you can actually create your own so that's the difference between XML and HTML there are multiple differences but that's one of the one of the main differences that in XML you can actually create your own tags but in HTML you can't okay moreover you if you if you're thinking oh XML it's so it's so good we can actually create our own tags and actually use uh it in our code so perhaps I will you I will just create my web pages using XML",
  "you I will just create my web pages using XML rather than HTML so I will just tell it won't work okay HTML pages are you know they are specifically used for creating websites there they are so you can't create a web page using XML okay so it's more it's often just you not often it's uh in the majority cases it's used for you know storing and transferring data so this is the use of EX nowadays okay so uh in XML yeah please please just tell me how I can you know access these link tags just",
  "me how I can you know access these link tags just guessing maybe i. link or something okay let's just try it but the thing is okay so we have got these link tags somehow but it's returning us the you know the closing tags okay that doesn't help us yeah but okay so it has suggested us actually okay so uh let's go ahead with this so actually you can use this so This find all function this find all function it's not limited to the soup object so this is the soup object we created so it's not",
  "so this is the soup object we created so it's not limited to the soup object okay you can use this on each and every element it returns to you okay so each and every element is actually a you know soup object kind of okay and you can actually use this method this find method so we have find all and we have find okay so find all uh okay so I guess we should use find all okay and over here we are searching for a link tag okay let's run it okay so it is saying that there is no attribute text",
  "so it is saying that there is no attribute text attribute all right let's run it okay so it's returning as a closing tag all right let's use fine okay so it's returning as a closing TX again it's a link tag inside it okay let's check what kind of Link tag we have so this is an item it is where it is okay so this is an item and here is the link tab but okay yeah so this is an item and we have a link tag over here but it's returning us the closing tag of that so can we try link. content or",
  "tag of that so can we try link. content or something link. content just guessing uh link. content you are saying link. content right content is this what you are suggesting that's like again it won't work uh I guess I do description because that was the parent right description let's just check it why not cor okay so it's returning something finally so we have so it's returning us a description of each and every of uh each and every instance of this uh you know item tag but this should be true",
  "this uh you know item tag but this should be true for the links as well okay let's search for titles so it's returning as a title but when I search for link it's not giving me the link let's go with this this one it's giving us none because obviously there is nothing inside these links so okay uh Gon Do you have any idea what's what I'm missing over here uh most likely the S of question so the link items are not in every item tag right right so when you're passing or traversing the tree it's a",
  "when you're passing or traversing the tree it's a tree like structure so you have to look inside so there is a way to navigate beautiful soup and uh the way to navigate is you've got tags that can go Nest inside uh various tags that you've got so your initial search that you did which is the find all so it found all item tags but that I think is regardless of nesting levels right okay uh whereas what you want to do is search search the children or search the descendants of particular tags but",
  "or search the descendants of particular tags but that should be true for you know so so for example if you so if you pulled up uh I mean you've called it item here ideally you should just call it tag because you haven't you don't know what the tag might be but um say for example inside the first item tag you want to pull up its descendants then what you would say is tag. descendants and it'll give you a list of it descendants and then can search you can do for child in tag. descendants and you",
  "you can do for child in tag. descendants and you will get the children of those descendants rning aat object uh just but if even if some item T doesn't have a link tag but that doesn't mean it should not return us anything inside so it's just returning us the you closing tag yeah just get the first item don't get find all right just find the first uh so you've got zero descendants uh what you do is no no not I don't think the word is descendant let me just check the keyword I think it is called",
  "me just check the keyword I think it is called uh by the way guys you can help us as well can just yeah yeah I just saw something in the documentation link that has shared they say ID is equal to link but they have to navigate to the for example description comma ID equal description comma ID I'll paste it in chat yeah yeah yeah for okay okay so it's using uh so actually we are patching the a tags over here yeah a is ID okay use a right over here but these links are not um they tags in",
  "over here but these links are not um they tags in themselves right these links yeah absolutely these links are tags in themselves so if I'm trying to get the you know description tag it's working perfectly it's working perfectly but when I'm accessing the links it's not returning me anything okay yeah first try with the so the easiest way is first try just getting a single item rather than getting whole list of and then paring it like you pass Json okay so like this right so you can see what's",
  "okay so like this right so you can see what's inside the the very first item tag right these are the item inside the first item tag so there's no link inside it yeah there's no link if you scroll up just SC scroll up uh you okay find all item can we have a look at your structure of the XML because I'm not sure what your XML structure is because I wasn't watching the session carefully so no no you can look you can look at the structure inside the soup itself because I don't know if the soup",
  "the soup itself because I don't know if the soup fetch the exact same thing so uh but it won't return us like it will just give us a last string to you know you can prettify that there is a way to prettify the output of that I think PP print or something like that will be there PV print yeah you have to import you have to that Library it as well no no as PP you can see PP print as and then uh try yeah PP do PP dot just one thing we are passing we are passing XML and we are using HTML parcel ah",
  "are passing XML and we are using HTML parcel ah that is probably what the problem is yeah it's but you know it's able to pass through the description tax just write XML so let's let me just check just write XML not xml. parcel okay try it's not working okay so the guess we have to install it so the documentation for XML passer is your is called lxml L yeah so there is I guess you have to install it somehow okay you have to install lxml and then you can use XML tag can tell me how can I install",
  "you can use XML tag can tell me how can I install it install beautiful soup 4 this is chat GPT okay this is not lxml P install beautiful sh for and then lxml and along with that lxml no comma [Music] but I got it so we have to do this so is already insted have to import it okay okay do do that XML thing now just XML now try running let use for this because this something which is not not expected from uh let's check okay so uh so there's uh another thing Saran you can use is use an XML viewer",
  "thing Saran you can use is use an XML viewer to structure file itself okay just find an online XML viewer file copl into it then you can examine theu you it's again returning the same thing that uh i. find and then it's know just print okay so it's using IF link tag is present or not let's try this once okay just I saw chat GPD again like it is it is showing lxml uh Dash and then XML in the parcel lxml lxml XML XML okay not working again I guess I have to install quity inst have work yeah let's",
  "I have to install quity inst have work yeah let's use HTML pass once again and but you didn't import x uh lxml right I actually did okay uh just copy this Cod hopefully it will work let's see uh okay can you scroll up a bit scroll up yeah you just show where you're importing it the parer thing beautiful where are you passing that one yeah it is I don't don't do don't do page do content okay okay in that XM do not do page do content okay and what I have to write lxml and DH XML find a three",
  "what I have to write lxml and DH XML find a three Builder with features you requested LL lxm okay so not to find a three Builder okay problem let's Okay what we can do is let's just copy this code once and I will run it in a Cell in a different cell let's just see is uh the is it actually fetching everything or okay so it has used XM over here all right right let's R it okay let uh we just pass this error to see Beau requires an ex F process okay so did it okay we install LML I did it let me",
  "so did it okay we install LML I did it let me run it once again okay maybe maybe try installing it from within the python file if that because because the environment you're using for the python notebook is it the same as the one in which you're installing yes okay it has given me the same thing that LX lxml pass it's saying that couldn't find a tree Builder all right this okay notbook you try the the one it is giving for jupter for J it's not giving uh separate code for exclamation mark p",
  "giving uh separate code for exclamation mark p install X this one okay safy it's it's installed I guess I have to close this file then run it again huh possibly so the passer should be called only lxml some reason you've got actually copied this from okay so it's giving me right now I just closed it and once again it's working okay the parer is only called lxml it's not anything else uh let's try lxml as well because I'm reading the documentation and that's what the documentation says it's not",
  "and that's what the documentation says it's not giving us anything with lxml but it's giving us with lxml stash XML okay let's try this in our J GPD saying you do either XML or lxml XML and has it uh used okay so it hasn't okay so we have to pass the content as it is okay let's try page is not okay I have to run each and every line once again okay let's do it won't be able to because I have to pass the content all right it's not giving us any error the moment let's all right so the entire error",
  "the moment let's all right so the entire error the entire problem was just closing this file and just reopening it so I guess it was something related to the cache so once we just closed this file and I just reopened it so the cache was CLE was clear it was able to uh use this lxm pass all right so this was the problem and this was a solution so if you guys have if you guys have facing this kind of problem you can you should just close it once okay it's like the you know the traditional way of",
  "it's like the you know the traditional way of you know repairing things so if the TV isn't working just close it once and let's hope it opens up you know perfectly fine the next time so that's what happened with us and it worked okay that's good so uh this is how you can actually get all these links okay so what we are doing uh if you guys have lost track because of that entire error thing so what we did we did nothing but uh we just remove this PP print because you know it's just spanning a",
  "PP print because you know it's just spanning a lot off okay so again this perhaps it has got its own cach this time okay so the cach is act thing again so that PP print is actually overriding the content of print somehow okay so what we're actually doing this I will uh just give you a brief summary so we have loaded this XML content with the beautiful soup then we are finding all the item tags so it's pretty you know this like this this same TX is pretty much understandable so we are just",
  "TX is pretty much understandable so we are just finding all the addon tags then let's just we just remove this okay then what I'm doing is this item tag so this item this item is actually an entire list of the item tags okay so it's an entire list of the item tags so now we are actually iterating over this list finding all the link tags and then we are exerting the text okay so that's the entire thing we are doing so uh okay so this is how you are going to extand these these links and that is",
  "are going to extand these these links and that is how you're going to you know solve this question any questions regarding this any question guys anything in the assignment we just need the first tag right the first IDE yes first link to check it once it's asking us to retrieve the link tags so there's nothing specified about the first tag or last they just want the link so we have to retrieve the link and then just paste the first link I don't think so because nothing is specified over here",
  "think so because nothing is specified over here which says that you have to you know specifically get the first link I believe that you have to use find all here to find all the links so what does this find do what's the difference between find and find all function so it's that let's say if in our item okay so this is my item tag so in my item tag I have multiple links okay I have multiple link tags the thing is that when I'm using fine just fine so it it's it's it's it's going to return me",
  "fine so it it's it's it's it's going to return me just this this the first occurrence of this link tag okay it's going to it's going to return me the only the first reference of the tag which is this one okay it won't return me this but when I will use find all it will retrieve all the links which are present in the item tag and then we will be able to you know then you will be able to get all these links in a list okay so this is how these this the difference between a find all and find",
  "this the difference between a find all and find function can can you explain how do we know whether I mean what the how the tree is U so that we can iterate over it the tree of XM so the yeah the page content how do we know we have to look for itm suppose I'm scraping a website well for that it's how you can question because I want to uh do it from a web for sure uh okay so the cash is back the cash has been clear somehow okay I will use PP print no I can uh okay what I will do is I will paste",
  "no I can uh okay what I will do is I will paste this I will use post I will copy this entire response and uh go to XML uh uh Rebuilder I guess so it's it's it claims to be the best XML viewer online let's just put it to the test okay so I pasted the entire XML file and all right so it has returned something and in this you can see that it's kind of like a Json structure okay I will open this and now you can see that what all items are present over here so we have this this title and uh I guess",
  "here so we have this this title and uh I guess it's present in this link one yeah this item yeah so all these items in these items we can you know find the links and uh yeah so the there are you know 20 items given to us so uh these 20 items so we in this entire page this entire thing about deep seek we have about 20 uh articles written on deep seek recently the most recent 20 articles and it has okay so uh you can just you know view what all you know things these uh these tags have it's just",
  "know things these uh these tags have it's just like you know passing just like you know Vie a some object okay so just Google uh XML tree Builder or tree viewer okay and this one claims to be the best one so just put it to the test okay okay thank you all right so any questions jar you have opened up your mic are you trying to say something trying to say something I guess no that's what is mon yeah what is Monica Monica this Monica is actually just extension this is an I guess it's an AI I just",
  "extension this is an I guess it's an AI I just downloaded this extension and it's you know I don't use it often it's just uh gu if you are using YouTube so using YouTube YouTube uh Sometimes using if you have this if you have the premium version of Monica then if you go to a YouTube video then it will suggest you to give the you know the entire summary of the video okay so this is how it's like an AI tool it's like an AI extension which helps you in a lot of things so if you visit let's say",
  "you in a lot of things so if you visit let's say search for all right so Monica should create something think yeah so Monica will uh you can actually ask Monica about something okay regarding this page so it will so I guess I have disabled it yeah so yeah so you can use Mona for various purposes so you can create a summary of this entire page let's say if I open Wikia then keep all right so uh I disabled it as it's not present over there but you can go to a YouTube video and then it will give",
  "can go to a YouTube video and then it will give you the entire summary of that video so also that's uh you know paid subscription based uh thing so it was I just you know gener a summary for uh for normal video and just because I was just testing it and it created a summary and somehow it was the trial version uh it was just the they gave us that they gave me the trial version for generating summary of a video and I just listed it some okay so uh this is Monica yeah one more question yeah so if",
  "this is Monica yeah one more question yeah so if I have to scrape a e-commerce website and I need to look for a certain company's products um how uh that is possible using beautiful uh I will open I have my Amazon account logged in okay all right so let's search for something uh let's search Samsung say for example so I need list of everything related to Samsung maybe okay Samsung let's go ahead and we have this ENT enre page right now if I want to search for uh let's say I want to extract the",
  "to search for uh let's say I want to extract the names of these uh of these products okay so how you can do this so this is another exercise for you so what is ask can you please show your beautiful soup code all right AR I can show you the beautiful soup code because I'm creating a new uh kind of project with beautiful Okay so we going to a new exercise for us and uh what we are going to do is uh we will be extracting we will be extracting the names of all these products which Amazon has",
  "the names of all these products which Amazon has returned to us when we search Samsung right and we will try to get the the price of these Samsung Mobile mobile phones as well okay and what I'm thinking is that we can create a CSV file for this and store the you know the name of the product and the price of the product and also the link of the product as so let's do thisise we have about 20 minutes so we can do this exercise and it would be a good exercise for you because uh you know yeah I",
  "good exercise for you because uh you know yeah I will be using Beautiful soap over here and uh it will just solidify whatever I taught until now okay so so someone just left okay let's go ahead with this exercise okay let me create and we will name it Amazon okay and by the way uh when you're using a virtual environment and you want to you know and you're also using an IB file in that case uh you have to click on over here on this select kernel option and then you will be given the option of",
  "option and then you will be given the option of you know selecting which kind of Curel you want so this EnV is this particular virtu environment and this python one this is the global environment okay so I will just select this virtu environment for this case and let's import our wonderful libraries okayy paste we need onas we need request we need PS4 I'll remove this also I'll remove lxml because now we actually have an HTML page so uh this page is is an actually it's a HTML page and it's",
  "page is is an actually it's a HTML page and it's nothing related to XML that's why we are going to use HTML passor this time right so uh by the way I want to give you guys this privilege that whenever you have any question just simply you can interrupt me or you can you know just raise your hand and I can answer that question right so also I prefer you that you shouldn't use that chat box again and again because you know when I'm teaching that's it's really you know it's really not it's not",
  "it's really you know it's really not it's not possible for me to check the chat box AR okay so if you have a question just open up your mic and speak up okay so uh I'll be creating this exercise let's go let's go okay so for this uh let's uh create a new variable which will be will call it Amazon okay it's Amazon and uh we are going to so some can someone tell me which Library I will be using first what is the first step in this going to use a request right to get the P absolutely absolutely",
  "request right to get the P absolutely absolutely and can anyone tell me why we are using request not Ric this time first connect to that uh website absolutely so this this Library will actually connect to that website and fetch the HTML page for us okay so it's going to f that entire HTML page for us and then we will be you know giving it to uh beautiful Su for the passing part okay so request do get so the get function is used for this so the get function will actually you fetch that entire",
  "get function will actually you fetch that entire response for you okay so let's just copy this and I will paste it in status so it's a pretty large link and I will run it all right so we have received the uh entire content I will print it okay so this is the entire content of this page you can also check it over here I will just click on inspect and now you can check this entire htl content over here okay so uh yeah as you can see that it starts with type and over here it starts with so yeah so",
  "with type and over here it starts with so yeah so this is the entire HTML content we have received and uh what I will suggest you whenever you are working like this always keep this particular page this uh elements tab open because uh you need to know which which element you have to you know PCH and which uh classes you have to use right so uh obviously you won't be you know actually going through this particular string which it has return because of uh we have a better option to look at okay",
  "of uh we have a better option to look at okay so uh let's go ahead and this is our we have patched the Amazon content and now I will create a soup object okay can anyone tell me how how I can create a soup object okay so all right codium thank you so it has already you know answered that question for you guys okay so this is how you will uh you were asking about the beautiful suit right so you can just uh know at this C ER so this is yes sir yes sir okay but over there we were using lxml for",
  "sir okay but over there we were using lxml for passing right because it was an XML okay once you're done just show me the code once okay done with this first do this one and then just show me the code for two minutes all right all right all right so because we are actually passing through an HTML page that's why we are using an H okay simple now I'll will run this and it has successfully created our beautiful super instance congratulations and Now can anyone tell me what's the next St we have",
  "Now can anyone tell me what's the next St we have to get to the I mean iterate through it to get to the name I that's the place where I don't know how we'll reach the uh the prices and names okay okay you are correct okay you say something you have to use that find all but then find all the things which you absolutely so the next step so let's I will just create markdown as well so this is Step number one where you are actually you know use this they're actually using request so this is just",
  "they're actually using request so this is just step number one okay this is Step number one where you have used request to actually Prest the entire content okay your step number do is creating a soup instance okay soup inance right so this is your second step your third step would be fetching you know Finding so if I head back to the previous code you can see that what we are doing so we created a soup instance then we find it out so we set out a search for all the item tags in this sou",
  "out a search for all the item tags in this sou variable right so uh we will use find all over here okay so the third uh uh the third step is you can find all okay so it would be Sue dot find all okay now now inside this find out what we have to find you have to search for that okay so uh firstly how you can you know search for the let's say the name of this product that's pretty simple simply click over this you know little arrow button over here can you guys see this little arrow button over",
  "can you guys see this little arrow button over here okay simply click over here and drag your mouse to the name of the object the name of the product right simply click over here now you can see that inside the ban element we have this name right but this obviously this entire you know this entire code contains multiple span elements okay so let's say if I head out a search for all span elements okay and these are all the span elements okay and uh let's say I run a for Loop over here I in this",
  "uh let's say I run a for Loop over here I in this and what I will do is I will run this okay so you can see that span this span tag is being used in multiple places okay it's being used in multiple places so how can I you know it's it's returning me the search the all in fact it's returning me plus and guess yeah there is this this cart this can you see this cart so this little cart text which is written over so it's also being contained in a span element so it's returning us everything so",
  "a span element so it's returning us everything so obviously you can't use we can't you know just simply use us uh you know give out a search for all the span elements right so what they're going to do is let's search for a commonality between these names right so I will head over here all right this is my span element all right so it's not much useful for us what I can do is I can look at its parent so obviously uh this H2 is the parent of span element Okay so and the span element is a",
  "of span element Okay so and the span element is a descendant of so this is how we actually you know this is this is the nor clure of uh these tags these tags okay so if something is inside a particular tag so it's a child of that tag all right so uh it's present over here and let's check for class okay so the class is okay okay and the link is over here as well and then there is a div tag okay let's search for some commonality so we have this a section okay we have this a section present over",
  "section okay we have this a section present over here and inside this a section okay so this is the entire SE so if you over over these elements you will be able to see uh what that element actually contains okay so the title is present over in this the title is present in this d t can you guys see this so the title is present in this D tag with the class of uh okay S Title instruction okay so this is the class this is the entire class S Title instruction style okay let's just copy this and",
  "instruction style okay let's just copy this and what I will do is I will uh find all the instances of the class okay so I will head back to my Roe code yeah so this is the code for the searching for a certain class okay so my class so my class is has copied okay I'll copy it once again so the class is s title S hyph Title hyphen instructions hyphen style okay so that's the class all right so uh this is how you actually you know search for classes as well so uh just a class uh class uncore so",
  "as well so uh just a class uh class uncore so that's the parameter name class underscore equals to this all right so uh this is how you search for it and let's head out okay so the class belongs to this DP tag okay so we can't let it remain we can't you know allow it to be a span let's search for all these all right so we have resed so we have received something we have received the date so we have received all the you know uh all the uh uh title all the all the title divs which contain the",
  "all the all the title divs which contain the titles of all these products okay so are you guys able to understand to this yes everything clear yes everyone just give me a thumbs up if you are if you if all of you are you know present in this meeting everyone just give me a thumbs up all right all right that's really good okay so uh this is how we found out all the div tacks which have the class S Title instructions St right now what we have to do because obviously we don't we we don't need need",
  "because obviously we don't we we don't need need this entire code we just need the you know we just need this uh where is a text so we just need the text in all these uh D TX okay so let's just store this so let's name it div tags okay the the variable name it's D TX okay now what I will do is simple I will run a for Loop for I in D tax and can anyone tell me what I have to do right now by the way it's telling me already but I guess that's not the okay that's the case all right so you know Cod",
  "okay that's the case all right so you know Cod just solves everything okay so uh are you guys able to understand what this uh piece of code is know doing are you guys able to understand so how did it figure out it was text M I mean how so text is the variable part that will vary across this is it actually text no no text the variable is this D text right but this text is actually the attribute it's fetching okay so this I it's nothing but these you know these D tags okay but the text attribute",
  "you know these D tags okay but the text attribute this text attribute it will fetch it will fetch the entire text which is present in these uh in this D tags in this D tags okay so en the entire text content which is present in these D tags will be given to you using this attribute okay I guess you can search for multiple things so if I do a link it will give me the links for sily uh okay there is nothing like link uh perhaps it can give me an anchor T okay so if I did uh i. a so it's giving me",
  "T okay so if I did uh i. a so it's giving me the the an all the anchor tags which are present okay so this is how these attributes are working okay so if I just search if I just wrote text it will return me the text which is present in those uh in those data in those deit tags right so these are the names of the products okay we got it and so uh this is the actually this is the actual title so if you if I just had back back to Amazon you can see that this is the this should be the entire title",
  "that this is the this should be the entire title so Samsung Galaxy s25 okay this is not the case Okay so thing is actually when I ran this request using python it actually suggested some other it actually suggested uh another set of Samsung mobiles instead of the one which I am seeing over here okay so it's I guess it's random somehow and uh it just returns uh okay okay okay so the thing is uh Sam okay so this is a sponsored product it changes every every time you query it will change okay so",
  "every every time you query it will change okay so every time we query it might okay so it may sponsored sponsored part only changes the other part does yeah yeah yeah so uh yeah actually this sponsored it should so I guess it's not present in this div which contains this class okay so that's why it's not returning as the sponsored one okay so this is another thing which you can you know understand that because it's sponsored it might not be included it might not have this T tag that's why it's",
  "it might not have this T tag that's why it's not returned over there okay so that's the case Okay so uh otherwise all these different mobiles are what we are able to see here so Samsung Galaxy m05 so it's exactly the one which is being given over there okay also Samsung Galaxy M35 exactly the same right so uh we have got the names of the these tags these you know these products now next thing was we had to you know get the prices and the links to these products okay that was the next part of",
  "to these products okay that was the next part of the question okay so we have to get the text and we have to get the links and we have to get the price okay and then we'll be you know compiling everything into a CSV file okay so uh let me just store these texts okay so I will create a dictionary by the name of name okay so obviously so this is the name of the product and I so let name it product name product name okay let's you know use some intelligent uh variable naming not just some big",
  "intelligent uh variable naming not just some big variable names okay so yeah thank you codium and now my names would be present in this list okay so that that's what we wanted now what we also want we want the link tags okay so let just copy this code once uh you guys may remember that uh uh we actually we were able to get the get to the links okay so if you just uh if you just know pass this a attribute along with this I uh uh this I iterator so it will return you the Anor tax okay so can",
  "so it will return you the Anor tax okay so can anyone tell me how can I access this HF this HF link from these anchor ties anyway find option find HF equals the thing is uh find will work when you are searching when we are you know actually searching within a tag okay actually HF yeah we can do HF but the difference between using we can't use find over here is that find will actually search within this element so this hre is an attribute of this anchor T that's why it won't be able to get that",
  "anchor T that's why it won't be able to get that okay so that's why we have to use the get I guess it was something like yeah get x uh the get function okay so using the get function you can actually fetch what what's you know uh you can actually f f the attributes as well okay uh but using but if you are going to use let's say if this anchor tag this Anor tag also had something inside it okay so let's say it had something like uh it has a title tag as well let say so in that case you can use",
  "tag as well let say so in that case you can use that F function that find function will be able to you know get to this title T but if you are using if you want to fetch the attribute the specific attribute of this Anor tag so this H is an attribute of this anchor tag right so if uh if you know HTML so it would be much it would be it would be you know it would be pretty clear to you why it's not giving us that if but those of you who don't know so actually these tag these Anor tag these title",
  "so actually these tag these Anor tag these title tag all these tags have attributes as well okay and these attributes Define how that tag will actually interact okay so uh HF is actually a tag of anchor tag sorry a attribute of anchor tag that's why it has to be fetch using a get function okay now I will just run this and let's hope it works yeah so we have received the L of the HF as well so if you just uh if you just you know copy this and www. Amazon Amazon and if I paste it over here it",
  "www. Amazon Amazon and if I paste it over here it should work that was amazon.in I guess oh yeah Amazon yeah so it's able to work it's working perfectly so if you just you know append this uh this prefix in front of this in front of these you know end points then you will be able to reach your desired destination okay so we have receive the links as well again what I will do I will okay I should create it will you know empty this entire list so what I will do is I will create a new variable",
  "so what I will do is I will create a new variable with the name product link and I will do I will just simply append it inside it do append and it's done okay uh okay product link is okay so I have to run this c as right so we have the product names and we have the product links as okay now the only thing which is remaining is the price so again because this uh because we were actually accessing the title tag and this this title okay so this title actually had the link to the uh this title",
  "title actually had the link to the uh this title actually had the link to the the specific page for the product so that's why we were able to get the links as well but now because we are uh we actually have to fetch this priz as well so for this you actually you have to you know search for another uh you just have to click on this Arrow tag once again and you have to you know drag your mouse over here and then it will direct you towards the specific code which is used to represent this",
  "the specific code which is used to represent this particular this uh price okay so we able to see that this a span a span element of Class A iph price hph whole it contains the price okay so it this price Now can anyone tell me how can I access how can just I you know fetch these prices somehow can anyone tell me this focus in the class do a class or a price hold something yeah so we have to focus on the class but what should be the code for this because you a tag I mean we find the tag for",
  "this because you a tag I mean we find the tag for price like we did yeah so we are going to use this find all once again and uh this time this should be span tax okay so uh you might be wondering that that this title also had you know this title also had a span but we didn't use a span uh we didn't use a span tag to search using uh in in the final above okay so in this find all in this find all we used a d tag instead of a fan tag you might be thinking about that so the specific reason is",
  "be thinking about that so the specific reason is because this pan doesn't have a unique class so actually it has no class okay so it doesn't have any class so it's pretty much useless that's why we had to resort to using the DP tags you know the parent of this particular time okay but in this case we actually have a span element which have a certain class which seems to be unique okay Al I'm not sure if if this is the case if this excuse me sir yeah sorry for the interruption but I have another",
  "sorry for the interruption but I have another meeting to attend can you please show me the code of that beautiful soup once all right yeah are so are you looking for this code this piece of code uh yes sir I was looking for this piece of code only okay is done second all right so now I'm going to find the spam and uh the class would be this one okay I just paste it over here let's hope it works all right uh because I have no idea it will work or not let's just print it and yeah we are able to",
  "not let's just print it and yeah we are able to find the prizes of all those mobile phones as well okay now can someone tell me how you can actually you know uh and someone tell me how you can actually fetch this fetch this uh know this price somehow can someone tell me how can you F this price out out of this you know piece of anyone so this span tags is so this soup do find all function this piece of code has actually returned us an ed is still a text right yeah so do text if you do we should",
  "a text right yeah so do text if you do we should get it yeah absolutely if we do a do text for instance if I run a for Loop or I in this I run a for Loop simple IO text will return you the price right so that's done and uh uh what you can do is that uh okay so let's just store this in another uh list let's call it it product price okay and it's an empty list and I'll be storing this product price. fend right so it's done all right so uh by the way you might be thinking that this is these prices",
  "you might be thinking that this is these prices should be numerical right but somehow it's you know it's being stored as a spring so this is not right right so can someone tell me how you can actually fix this this is you know just basic python stuff this just basic python pythonic logic you have to use to do this particular thing so can anyone tell me what should I use and how can I you know convert this to a numerical value rather than a string value so this is actually a string I want to",
  "value so this is actually a string I want to convert it to 6499 a proper a proper integer value can even tell me this is just crude pythonic logic nothing Rel to beautiful so for request canone tell me remove the commas and use the int function exactly exactly so this is the way we are going to know proceed so uh it's pretty simple I will create a new variable inside this as well okay so I will store it right here now what I will do is I will remove the comma so can anyone tell me how can I",
  "remove the comma so can anyone tell me how can I remove these comma values anyone so codium has done the job for us and you can see that it can be simply replaced using the replace method okay so this is the replace method and it just requires the what you want to replace with what okay so we are replacing a comma with nothing okay so this is an empty string so we are replacing a comma with an empty string and it would do the task for us if I just print this prize now so yeah so it has removed",
  "print this prize now so yeah so it has removed those comma separators and now again these price values are if I just use a type over here the type function so the type function actually uh you know informs you about what type of object is this okay so it's a string object so to convert it to integer simply use integer okay so it just converts this string to an integer and this is an integer so this is going to be an integer okay so what I'm going to do is I will simply copy this and paste it",
  "to do is I will simply copy this and paste it over here okay this should work let obviously it will work okay and uh okay okay okay I have to actually you know rerun this product price because it actually abended all those values inside uh this product pie okay product price we'll run it once again and now it will be perfect okay so these are the prices for our products and uh we have got the the links and the names as well right now All That Remains is to create a data frame and store it as a",
  "is to create a data frame and store it as a CSV right so how can you actually save it in a in a CSP that's using Paras okay I yeah because we've extracted these prices separately and the product name separately like how do we ensure that these are all in the same order they will be in the same order when you are fetching they will always come in the same order yeah exactly will always yeah you can also verify it so 6,400 this price should be that blue mid one yeah so this is the pride of price",
  "blue mid one yeah so this is the pride of price of this uh mint green uh Samsung Galaxy and you can see the price okay so also you can confirm the second price is 18, almost 500 so you can see so it's it always beautiful so always returns you in the same order ittl okay so now how many of you know about Paras Paras Library anyone the P Library anyone we know about P that's okay so also because uh four people know about FAS that's good uh but we have uh you know part we have about 12",
  "uh but we have uh you know part we have about 12 participants excluding me Carton and this shared screen so we have about uh we have about nine people so I guess I will explain how I'm going to create a CSV file so it's a pretty simple process okay let's create a new variable okay so I will name this data because obviously this is this is our data and what I will do is uh I will create a data frame instance okay I will create a simple data frame instance so data frame it's nothing but a table",
  "instance so data frame it's nothing but a table okay data frames in FAS are just like tables okay so you just have to remember this okay so we have created a new empty table so if I just print this it's going to give me nothing because this data table contains nothing inside okay so how to create this table simple PD so what is what is this PD uh this is actually this so I imported pandas as PD okay so this as is short for Alias okay so pandas has been imported as PD and you know you can use uh",
  "been imported as PD and you know you can use uh you can use par Library using this PD uh text okay this PD uh call okay so I just created this I just created this empty uh table okay that's data creat data frame now simple what we have to do simple we have to create the columns right the First Column would be product names okay product name just product name and I will equate to the list we have okay so you guys might may remember that this was the this was the list which contains the names of",
  "the this was the list which contains the names of our products right now what I did I just simply you know I just uh you created a column in this data print I just print this now I have execute this so if I print this now so we have received we have created a so it has added a new column into this data F right so exactly like this you can add new columns and next one would be uh product price and it would be product price and the next one would be product uh link okay and it would be uh it",
  "be product uh link okay and it would be uh it would be product link all right now if I will execute this particular line of code okay okay so it's saying that the length of values hasn't isn't matching okay I have to check something think the thing is perhaps the the uh product the product link yeah so this product link perhaps what it's doing is let's check the length of this this so 15 there should be 15 values in it okay so I I suspect that it's actually okay so it's actually giving the",
  "it's actually okay so it's actually giving the price of this watch as well okay uh you have to keep in mind so these things you have to keep in mind that uh if there is an anomaly like this so if there is an error like this so the length of values doesn't match that means there is an extra value present in dat okay and in the in most cases it's either the first value or the last value okay so it's I did it for the link okay let's check the name as well so name is 16 as well okay so price okay",
  "as well so name is 16 as well okay so price okay it's the the price is lacking something right okay the price is lacking something and okay okay all right so I guess we should uh you know we should consider the first values for this okay I will consider the first 15 values because it contains some kind of error I guess because U I guess there is some element at the very end in these in these lists which uh which it has just picked up somehow okay I will run this once again and saying this time",
  "I will run this once again and saying this time of values doesn't match data okay okay I think I have to this right so it has worked Let's uh see it so this is the uh our data frame now how to convert it to a CSV file that's pretty simple simple uh simply just uh use the 2 CSP method sorry 2 CSV method okay so when you have this variable data you can simply use the 2 CSV uh method on this simply name your CSV as well so this is how you can name your CSV and it would be Samsung Amazon let's just",
  "CSV and it would be Samsung Amazon let's just name it Samsung amazon. CSV okay and also you can uh use this index. Falls then actually it's not necessary to specify this because index index is equal to false it's just uh used to you know truncate this uh these index values to you know just prevent these index values to be transported to your CSC files okay I will just run this and did you guys see that it created a new CSC file for us okay so let's go ahead and you know check this CSV file in",
  "go ahead and you know check this CSV file in Excel it is yeah here is our Samsung Amazon F and let's open this all right so this is the uh you know this is the fruit of our hard labor we did and uh you can see that we have the name of our products we have the prices and then we have the links okay uh so this is how you can actually extract and convert it to a PSP file let's say if I want to you know if I'm a guy and I want to you know search for all the product for all the Samsung products",
  "for all the product for all the Samsung products which are present on Amazon I can do this I can execute this function uh sorry not function I can execute this uh entire procedure and then I can you know rather than you know you scrolling on Amazon and you know looking into each and everything I can simply create a CSV file and then I can you know search okay so this is the price and now the better thing with this is that I can you know use filters over here so I can you know OD I can you know",
  "over here so I can you know OD I can you know sort these values as well so if I just sort it so you can see that this is so let's say if I if I'm considering if I want to see uh products from low to high price rate so this is how you can do it okay so there is a product for 6,500 and then there is a product for 72,000 as well okay you can apply multiple Fe es in Excel for this particular data okay so this was it about using the how you can use beautiful so and then you can convert it to a CS",
  "beautiful so and then you can convert it to a CS okay very helpful thank you sir I think couple of things I need to figure out maybe I'll try by myself is that how to do it across different pages and because this heeld it probably only from page one and the other thing was that maybe all website don't allow scraping so how to check whether it's allowed or not so well every website will allow scraping because they have you know publicly deployed their website and then it's our right to extract",
  "their website and then it's our right to extract it okay so not if you extract it multiple if you if you do like a very heavy extraction then it's a problem but normal then that can be a problem because uh actually you know I was banned by nomin a few months back so nominating AP I just told you about so actually I was banned by nomina because I was sending a lot of requests I was actually building a project of mine where I uh required the latitudes and longitudes of multiple locations so I was",
  "and longitudes of multiple locations so I was using nominative for that and because I was you know sending a lot of AP request in a small time frame that's why they banned me for a while and uh thankfully they unbanned me and now I'm able to use nomin yeah okay I also need to use it for my project only so I don't know maybe I don't have to do it all at the same time and give but but another thing was that um I read it that um they don't many websites they don't allow you to use so we have to",
  "they don't allow you to use so we have to check whether it's allow well uh in beautiful so you can extract anything okay so if a website if you just you know right click on a website and then it gives you this inspect option then you can do anything with that website so their entire code this entire code of their website is open source kind of Open Source okay so you can you know you can manipulate anything you can you know fetch anything so we are not actually so that problem actually occurs",
  "are not actually so that problem actually occurs when you're using an API okay so for instance this nominative it's an API right so I was using nominative in a in a you know a very bizarre way probably and that's why they ban me otherwise if you uh otherwise if you are just working with is that yeah so otherwise if you just working with uh you know just scraping data using Beautiful soap you just requesting the HTML content so this so what the what did that request uh like that request",
  "the what did that request uh like that request requested get function gave you it gave you this entire HTML function this the entire HTML code right so that's allowed for anything you can you know give them multiple request you can just know you know you can give multiple request to this uh particular page so that's not a problem that's yeah just uh just interrupt you here so legally uh when it comes to scraping sites you have to actually follow their terms and conditions so if you uh if you do",
  "their terms and conditions so if you uh if you do not follow their terms and conditions then uh you are liable like you said to be banned the second thing is um some sites have uh the ability to know where your request is coming from so if it's not coming through a browser then and if it's coming through for example python code it knows the difference and so it knows the agent that is actually requesting the site so certain web servers protect against that by not giving you data uh if you do it",
  "that by not giving you data uh if you do it by Python program there are ways around that uh yeah yeah there are ways so actually I guess I came across a website of that sort and actually I use selenium for that yeah so that's a different workflow there's something called senum which acts like a browser and then navigates the site as if a person is doing it and it's a little more involved than beautiful Su but those are ways to get around that problem actually we will be teaching you selum as",
  "problem actually we will be teaching you selum as well so it would be a I assume that it would be really fun lecture when we introduce selenium to you and uh uh actually I created a project where uh it went to uh you know it went to indeed it went to the indeed website and then it SC the entire web the entire web page and it was able to you know give me all the job requests which have come which have been posted in the past seven days so this was a project then which I created before getting",
  "was a project then which I created before getting this internship actually this daip so actually I was searching for an internship and rather than going through indeed Page by page I just executed this uh I just created a python script and you know just ran it sat I just sat there and it just did the work for me it returned me the the entire all those job request in a CSV file and I just ordered it so yeah I created that that project but eventually I got I got this dhip and then I just dropped",
  "I got I got this dhip and then I just dropped it off okay by the way uh manmit you were saying that uh you have to find a way to you know uh open another page so there are multiple pages over here right yeah pages so it's very simple simply you have to enter you have to you know uh so you have to pass another parameter over here so if you just pass this page parameter so if you just uh in front of this URL if you just write and page is equal to two it will reir you to the second page right if I",
  "it will reir you to the second page right if I just change it to seven it will take me to the seventh page okay can you see this this is the seventh page this is how it works okay if I so the maximum page limit is 20 over here if I just uh change it to 20 it will redirect me the 20th page so you can just create a for Loop for this and you know fetch everything inside got it okay thank you so much yeah all right guys so just use a use a sleep timer so that it's not yeah exactly you should use a",
  "so that it's not yeah exactly you should use a so actually what C is saying is that when you fetching these HTML entire HTML content from a web page what happens is it requires a few seconds to fetch right it it requires a few seconds to fetch and you have to give that relaxation time in between executing this for instance so if you are running a for Loop let say I'm running a for Loop and I have something something something okay and now uh whenever you are you know uh let's say I'm let's say",
  "you are you know uh let's say I'm let's say I'm doing something with that page you should always give a sleep timer okay so this is actually a library so uh sleep uh and two inside this function means a sleep timer of two seconds okay so this can actually be know imported using from this from uh time maybe maybe it also kind of uh prevents that web page from yeah yeah yeah absolutely abely like when you do email marketing we like use the same concept that even if you are sending like 100 Mees",
  "that even if you are sending like 100 Mees you you should be a time frame yeah you give a time frame of that they will B you five minutes five minute automatically so that the API does not block you or something yeah absolutely so always you know you should use a sleep timer for your own sake and for the sake take of the end point as right so uh I guess it's pretty late and uh this was it for this entire session and uh uh J you are saying something and probably you are using some some German",
  "and probably you are using some some German letters as well can you just open your mic and speak up yes for all right he's not willing to his mic all right so uh that concludes this live session and uh okay your mic is not working all right so uh if you have time can you please explain how many packages you have to install in vs code and to delete all these packages okay so uh to install these packages it's uh it's always depends on the project you are developing right okay so for instance I",
  "you are developing right okay so for instance I was working with Beautiful soap request library and few more things that's why I had to install only these few things okay so I just installed pandas request and beautiful soup and also XML lxm to pass that XML file right so that's why my EnV contains only these uh few so some of these are default and some of these have been installed so it totally depends on the product you okay and to delete that you can just simply Google or you can ask chat",
  "you can just simply Google or you can ask chat how to delete packages from python okay that's pretty simple all right so if there are no further questions we can end the session sir uh yeah sorry uh did you cover this PDF to markdown because I tried that question I I cover what uh the PDF to markdown uh no not yet because I tried actually all the tools you know which are listed there I even installed docu Ling and tried it but uh that PDF seems to be quite complicated uh none of the tools are",
  "to be quite complicated uh none of the tools are able to par it and actually question has been changed actually so it is uh you can give it a try again because the question has been changed okay okay sir okay also after even changing it you it it might require you to you know do some manual checking as well so yeah it is a tedious task you have to do okay in the last question and uh so we will be covering the other questions in the next live session uh right so see you guys next week okay thank",
  "uh right so see you guys next week okay thank Youk was a really great special for me as well so explaining you the entire beautiful Library it was really EXP really very helpful thank you",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/jXj6bqy4R4c =====",
  "okay just just give me one second okay okay so good evening everyone uh this is um first session for week five uh but we will be discussing project U exclusively today I've noticed that a lot of you have joined um G5 deadline uh we're in discussions of moving the deadline but we don't know exactly at the moment what date we are going to fix it to but it will not be this weekend that much I can assure you uh that's so that you can have some bit of extra time to do Focus just on project one and",
  "of extra time to do Focus just on project one and also because we can't cover the content of week five this a week so today's session tomorrow's session day after session all three sessions will be focused on Project one um if you're uh done week one through week three well then you should be well on your way uh with regards to being able to solve it what we will do today is um go through um the steps required in order for you to execute on it it and um so we'll be taking you through through",
  "it and um so we'll be taking you through through that process our goal today will be to um get now for some of you this might be very straightforward and you already know how to do but we get a lot we've got we got lot of private messages emails um and things like that other than discourse where students have said you need to help us with B these basic things so what we'll do is we'll take you through the basic steps okay uh and for some of you that may not be necessary but you'll have to bear",
  "that may not be necessary but you'll have to bear with us because we're trying to get everyone to at least submit a project right get to the point of submitting a project so we'll take you through the basic steps some of it may be too easy for you today but we will then once we um so first part is getting GitHub sorted pushing code to it um writing some code which will be uh running uh a at least task A1 on your project and the reason we say at least task A1 is because without running task A1",
  "least task A1 is because without running task A1 you you will fail your project anyway right so if you can't get task A1 to run you cannot run the rest of your project so we will get you to task A1 and then we will give you some code um a code skeleton to get you working on other tasks as well so with that minimal structure then at least you should be able to to execute on on the rest of it because then it's kind of I won't say copy paste but it is um just altering making some alterations um in",
  "is um just altering making some alterations um in your code to run the rest of the task so this is this is the goal will we cover everything today I'm not 100% certain um but we will try to at least get you to task A1 today does that sound like a plan that works for you guys okay right so if you [Music] see starting and ending steps as well yeah uh so what do you mean by that an can you just clarify a little bit for [Music] me steps related yeah yeah we will do that as well uh is on our agenda",
  "yeah we will do that as well uh is on our agenda for today yeah we will talk about that as well the evaluation how it works okay uh I'm just waiting on getting this up done here [Music] have you put the markdown file in markdown file okay got it go to the drive hi ripin are you a student uh in uh in the TDS course rips ripan Kumar are you are you a TDS um student am I audible yes sir AUD uh hang on I'm just trying to pull a file here okay just give me one second [Music] where is the Mark is",
  "give me one second [Music] where is the Mark is this the markdown no oh there it is yeah got it got it to share my [Music] screen okay is um is my screen visible okay what I was trying to do is uh get a um a clean BM running so that um we can kind of show you everything from the start that's why there was a little bit of a delay in getting this uh uh getting this uh session started um I'm not entirely sure this VM is working correctly but um we will see explain Part B as well so today we might",
  "will see explain Part B as well so today we might not get to Part B okay uh if we can get at least to uh getting to task A1 then that would be I would say U something that we trying to get to today the SEC um there's a session tomorrow and there's a third session so we will um be discussing project all through this week so don't worry about Tas um yeah Kumar open your mic and ask you sir is this session recorded and available on YouTube also so that we can watch it later yeah it will be",
  "so that we can watch it later yeah it will be recorded and available on YouTube but the only thing is you won't be able to ask questions on YouTube right so okay sir okay so that's the only thing that's the downside okay okay sir sir actually I am trying uh working on my project sir and I had generated data folder as the way you explain on the git and uh on discour Portal yeah so right now the I'm currently encountering an issue like how can I verify if I am defining the task correct or not sir",
  "if I am defining the task correct or not sir like how can I verify that with the help of evaluate that five file okay so um just a just a caveat before I start okay I've created uh so this what you're seeing on the screen is a is a VM okay I'm actually running inside a VM I haven't verified that this VM works okay so there might some issues today but we hopefully there won't be any issues we will try and see okay um okay so let me just get the session started anyway sure so as you know um there",
  "started anyway sure so as you know um there um there are few deliverables that are absolutely required with regards to um uh project and uh the first thing is you have to create a GitHub repository so can some can so there are 54 people of you here can any can you raise your hands if you don't know how to do a GitHub repository okay thisit anyone else okay so the rest of you all know how to get a GitHub repository running right now for the sake of rishit and also people who are going to be",
  "of rishit and also people who are going to be watching this session later I will just briefly go through how it's done okay so effectively rishit you will have to open your mic and respond okay um the first thing is do you know how to get to GitHub and create a new repository through the site you have to just created the deposit okay you have created one on GitHub yeah yes sir okay so the next step is you have to add an MIT license to it do you know how to do that no sir okay normally when you",
  "know how to do that no sir okay normally when you create a repository so I'm going to use this as an example okay um normally when you create a repository there should be a files setting where it allows you to add it it's typically when you create it itself is this not scrolling that's what I'm trying to [Music] scroll okay that's weird that's not scroll okay open this again okay [Music] okay it's working right [Music] so actually I'm not sure where the typically what happens is we get uh okay",
  "the typically what happens is we get uh okay I don't know why my mouse is not working that's very weird there we go [Music] typically usually when we create it itself it we are able to put a license file so maybe I can just create one so can you go through the step one yeah yeah so what I'll do is yeah I think I'll just create one that's just the easiest thing to do so uh okay so so when you uh log your GitHub right you can just create a new repository okay says new put a name so we'll say TDS",
  "okay says new put a name so we'll say TDS today's Tuesday session I'll call it TDS Tuesday and then um you can choose it to be public or private uh for today's demonstration we can try to make it private because then we I can show you how to put a token and um get uh get the token to um access your repository so that way your repository can in private but one thing to remember is if you make it private don't forget to make it public before submission if you don't do that you will not pass the",
  "if you don't do that you will not pass the project okay so just keep that in mind um but I'll show you how to create a private one today because it's a little more involved and then you can ignore this add a read me file but you see over here where it says choose a license so this is where you say select and you say you can you have to use this license okay MIT license sir can you tell me the purpose of this the purpose of this in order to pass project you need to do it no the purpose of MIT",
  "project you need to do it no the purpose of MIT license what is the oh the purpose of the license okay so different licenses right allow someone else who looks at your code it tells them what they can and cannot do with your code so if say for example if uh if you use a a close cled license okay here there are no closed licenses but let's say you don't want anyone to commercially use your software uh and make money from your software then you have to give it a different license term your",
  "you have to give it a different license term your solicitor or someone who deals with IP protection they are the people who will be able to advise you what kind of commercial licenses are available the licenses available here are generally public licenses but they are different types of public licenses so the most common one is this uh gnu which is General public license or Apache license or MIT these are the most common ones that are usually used uh MIT is usually used in education circles uh",
  "uh MIT is usually used in education circles uh GNU is a you know generally used for open source software and so is apach there are slight differences it's not worth me discussing that what the differences are today and I'm not a legal expert on what what the claes are you can always look that up but these are the purposes of license um and for project you are required to use this one okay don't use any other license so if if you don't have these deliverables right you will not these are like",
  "deliverables right you will not these are like your minimum requirements you must must have this you see here it says prerequisites must be followed for you to be EV eligible for evaluation so you will not even be evaluated if these are not present just remember that yes saki sir actually I want to ask if uh is it okay if we initially take repository to be public uh yeah you can yeah you can there's no issues with that you I'm just showing private today because some of you may want to do it",
  "today because some of you may want to do it privately and then but the important thing to remember is if you look here this is a requirement it has to be public okay so you can change it to a public uh repository later but don't forget to do it so I'll make it private today and then later I'll show you how to get it back to public okay sir the repo is created click on ADD file ah to create a new U Abit you're saying to create a new license is it ah fantastic that's a great suggestion thanks AB",
  "ah fantastic that's a great suggestion thanks AB so but if you're creating it for the first time this is how you do it you can select over here what you want don't don't worry about a read me file or get ignore just make sure that there's an MIT lense click create repository and it creates it we'll also try abijit route just to see if that works so I was working [Music] on see more um was called TS projector that's not [Music] one I have lost track of it tools TS oh my let me yeah here this",
  "track of it tools TS oh my let me yeah here this this one okay so the other way is abijit suggestion which is go say add file create new file so this uh and then uh where is what is it uh create new file in file name type license okay we type license oh choose a license template oh that's fantastic that's Prett convenient so as as soon as you typee license it will this will pop up over here saying choose a license so if you've already got a repository this is how you can add a license to it",
  "this is how you can add a license to it okay say okay and then you can select one of these we say MIT and uh I do say review and submit and then it's created the license if you go back here you can see that it has added the license file so that's a fantastic suggestion so that's how you create it create a license if you already got one okay everyone's fine with it so far right yes okay great right the next thing is uh we need to me look at our list of things that I need to go [Music] through",
  "list of things that I need to go [Music] through okay now right so the next thing we need to do is configure git on our system okay so if I open up so I presume that most of you are working in WSL um for the purposes of this demonstration okay I'm not going to show you how to run or create WSL but there are there are some simple commands you can run in your um shell if I go poers shell okay if you type WSL dash dash I think it's install Okay um I know it says the name of the WSL but if you have",
  "know it says the name of the WSL but if you have not installed WS at WSL at all see here if you not installed it at all then you only use this okay and once it runs through this uh command don't don't worry about this okay just if you run WSL D- install once it completes you have to restart your system okay and once you restart your system you can verify that it is installed correctly you just put- l- oops D okay and then it will tell you if it's been installed and what what's running on it and",
  "been installed and what what's running on it and all that sort of okay so that's um then the next thing you want to do is after WSL is installed you wants to install a particular ver version so like Ubuntu or something like that then what you do is you um you say WSL um install and the uh distribution name that you want to give it so I would recommend this one 2404 because it's a very stable long LTS version so LTS means long-term support it's usually for corporations so it means there are very",
  "for corporations so it means there are very less bugs in it okay so the code is tested before been put out so use this I would say so what you would do is you would say WS this is after you restart your system okay you would say install and you would give this um why do I keep using my mouse okay you use WSL and you say Dash Das install and you give it this name and it'll run it I'm not going to do this now because it's already installed and it takes a long time so that's not what I'm going to",
  "takes a long time so that's not what I'm going to show you that's you share the link for this T file this one right yeah I can stick it in the browser here for you sir why do we need WSL because um first of all it's a separate environment from the rest of your system so if anything messes up it's not going to destroy your system uh um so that's the Great Value about it and almost everything that we do right most of the packages we run typically run through Linux and they run well on Linux that",
  "run through Linux and they run well on Linux that is does not mean you can't do it in Windows you can um but the way you do it through there will be might be a bit different so that's why I'm showing you through WSM okay but that's the Assumption that's the Assumption I'm making okay um so once that's ready run vs code uh we we can give commands on WSL using vs code as well yeah yeah you can do so that's what I'll show you next uh if I do so if you want to so next thing is of course you should",
  "you want to so next thing is of course you should have vs code on your system and um I've just installed vs code on here and then the extension that you would need is called WSL and you can see this right WSL install so install this extension okay you go to extensions in vs code and say install okay that should be done all right the next thing is I believe I can just type dot code over here should oops [Music] okay just give me a couple of minutes here sorry today's session might run a little",
  "here sorry today's session might run a little long okay I hope you guys don't mind if you're using Mac it's no problem you don't need um um you don't need to worry about running Linux commands on Mac Mac natively supports most Linux commands without any issues and in fact I'm running this Windows VM on my Mac okay so if youve noticed now I've uh if you notice the difference between these two uh vs codes so this first vs code put this on this um come on oops okay if you look at the difference",
  "come on oops okay if you look at the difference between these two okay this I ran from within WSL Okay I uh typed this word uh code and it launched the uh vs code and it launched this window over here and if you look over here carefully at the bottom it says WSL 24.0 this is running inside your WS inside your Linux machine this one is running on Windows and that's why you can see over here it doesn't have this uh indication over here okay so we will be running this one if I open if I say open a",
  "be running this one if I open if I say open a folder and in fact and it'll show you these folders and these are inside the Linux machine so if I open uh if I open actually the terminal which is control yeah you notice it's got this kind of a terminal because this is inside the Linux machine see this is inside the Linux machine so that's why whatever we do now will be running from inside this Linux machine so that's the next thing okay the next item on the agenda is once we got that running uh",
  "item on the agenda is once we got that running uh is my next okay so next I've got to show you how to so you'll write some code you have to push it to GitHub so if you look at one of the requirements of the project right is you have to commit and push your code to GitHub okay that's a that is a requirement um is it evaluation yeah it exis yeah so you'll have to push push it uh push your Docker file basically to GitHub repository okay so we'll just make some write a little bit of code and push",
  "make some write a little bit of code and push it now okay oh actually before we push that code we have to initialize your GitHub repository so the folder I'm working in right now is just my uh home folder um and so we can just make a directory and call it TDS Tuesday okay and then uh make this a bit bigger okay so the next step is to um start so inside your computer is uh WSL will have its own git I think it does anyway let's just make sure yeah okay so yeah so when you install ws and",
  "sure yeah okay so yeah so when you install ws and particularly Ubuntu it comes with git already part of the package okay so uh this git is different from GitHub okay uh this git is a package that keeps versions of your code locally on your system but you need to connect this to GitHub you need to push code to GitHub which is online right so first what you do is you do git in it which initialize the repo so that's what it's done here and then the next thing is uh we need to add that repo that",
  "next thing is uh we need to add that repo that you have created on GitHub to uh to your local machine okay um but before we do that we also need to um configure git uh so that it works correctly okay so for that we need to use this command called git config D- Global user.name okay and then you put your name and then you say get config Global if you don't do this by the way it will you will it will not work correctly your GitHub uh your git repo okay when you're trying to push uh commits and",
  "okay when you're trying to push uh commits and things of that s okay so these two commands one is your username you have to set and one is the user email you have to configure this and uh then your git is ready to um start adding repost to it and pushing uh code to it so next thing is we will add this what we call the remote repo so this is the remote repo because this is uh not local so it's somewhere away from your system right so it's called a remote and um if you go to this button called",
  "a remote and um if you go to this button called code you can see this URL here right you can copy this URL so there's the copy button here go back to your terminal over here and then just uh just one thing in G uh in global user.name you have mentioned the name but uh in the um in the Chrome your GI have uh username was different so is it uh is it will work for different username as well yeah so this git right this is this is uh specific to your local machine here but you have to configure this",
  "local machine here but you have to configure this because whenever you push something to your remote repo right it needs to know who has sent it so it will just say cartton has sent it you know it could be someone else also right so you could have a team working on it so you could have jrj or you could have sarange and they all need to be identify so that's why you need this username so because so that you can identify who is pushing what okay hello yes okay yeah all right so after this is",
  "hello yes okay yeah all right so after this is configured uh now we can do get uh remote add and you to put the repo name here right so you do okay and so you put the repo name here and then uh oh sorry not sorry not the URL the repo name so in this case we'll call it TDS Tuesday or something okay repo name and then the URL thing this is just to identify it and this is this is the um URL of the V now this is yeah that's a different exper TS 25 yeah that's okay yeah sure yeah that's okay we have",
  "that's okay yeah sure yeah that's okay we have I mean uh it's to demonstrate how to add uh your url right so you just put the URL and put the um name of the repo okay this is your local name of the repo this is the remote repo you're trying to add okay okay okay okay um so let's see I think it will not work because it's I think it's because it's private but we'll see oh it added it okay fine maybe this one is public I'm not sure I don't remember let's um let's have a look uh uhuh so then we",
  "let's um let's have a look uh uhuh so then we need to pull some code so get pull TDS Tuesday and um I think it's called main branch right okay so It'll ask you to sign in and then we just have to sign in over here this is the advantage of doing this via vs code by the way you don't have to worry about tokens I think I think you're able to just authenticate this way why did this not work room that's correct just give me one second might on here which ones I can [Music] yeah okay yes update okay",
  "ones I can [Music] yeah okay yes update okay here authenticator app so I've got um two Factor authentication so just give me one second hello [Music] [Music] great so you notice I didn't even have to um get the tokens or things of that sort because we have installed the extensions and we've installed um running this through vs code it plays nicely with the GitHub okay so that's one advantage of doing it this all right another extension that might be worth doing then is called is GitHub",
  "might be worth doing then is called is GitHub extension I'm sure let's see uh get actually now typically I have all these already installed on my system but I'm doing this on a Windows VM for your for your benefit so that you you can uh so could you just specify all the required extensions to be installed in vs code yeah yeah I'm just um the GitHub actually let me check on my system okay hang on extensions what do I have here H actually I think it's already natively part of uh yes code let's",
  "it's already natively part of uh yes code let's have a look yeah you don't have to install a GitHub extension it's natively part of vs code so if you go to Source control over here the file we just pulled yeah you can see that it already gets it gets the folder and the license so you can see this right so it has already done that which is which is very nice let's uh Tuesday yeah so that's the that's the workflow for uh getting your uh GitHub linked to your uh place where you're doing your",
  "linked to your uh place where you're doing your working on your code okay so the next thing we want to do is we want to um so we'll start creating an application we'll call it app. okay um and let me just uh grab some code over here that's been made already yeah just open your mic and speak because I can't see the screen at the moment what uh if you have raised your hand or something or sir uh I've raised it uh sir just one question uh whenever uh we'll call we'll type code on WSL terminal yeah",
  "we'll call we'll type code on WSL terminal yeah for system uh every time the window for vs code which will open is every time is New or uh the one which we are working in you'll have to repeat that question again just say that again please sir uh whenever we type code on the terminal the window which will uh open uh vs code window uh open do we have do do this window is every time new or uh it will uh the previous one uh I I still didn't understand the question does did someone else understand",
  "the question does did someone else understand what uh who's speaking sorry sir um saki actually yes sir sir I'm asking that uh you uh you type code on WSL terminal to open this uh this this oh this vs code yeah yeah understood okay okay okay so you're saying so if I just close this for example right if I CL yes sir I close all this let me close all this okay so you're saying on this terminal if I type code yes sir it will open exactly where we were working before okay sir that's what that's",
  "were working before okay sir that's what that's what I'm asking okay thank you sir yeah okay uh in fact um what we can do I'll just close this go one step down type code here and see what happens yeah it just opens to the previous one that it was working on okay thank you sir all right okay uh meanwhile okay so uh the first thing okay let's let's have a look back at our project one so we've got okay okay so we need to create some little code that we can push into Docker right um pushing code by",
  "we can push into Docker right um pushing code by the way is also straightforward from from WSL so let's say um you created an app. file and um excuse me sir yeah are you live streaming this session no it's not live streamed it's being recorded so will you share this later on for typically it'll come tomorrow morning okay sir thank you thank you so yeah so this um so let's say we create this file this is the project file okay and now we want to push this so you see it turned to green and it says",
  "this so you see it turned to green and it says you so what that means is it's been modified and pushing to GitHub is just as simple as uh saying um you need to put a message here so create Creed app okay it could be anything it doesn't have to be but just for your reference and just say commit and then say yes and then publish and it's done okay that's it that's all you have to do to push code if you're doing it via a terminal then you would have to use um so share the command for you for that",
  "to use um so share the command for you for that it's um get push okay so before we pulled code remember so we pulled code from the remote server now we pushing it to the remote server so TDS Tuesday we called it okay and which branch we say main branch uh oh yeah we are not in the correct folder TDS Tuesday fail to push uh doesn't match any maybe it's not called main it's called Master okay right so then I have to do this again uh I think here most likely I have to give a token most likely but",
  "likely I have to give a token most likely but we'll see yes okay so you see the difference now right so I've um tried to push it from terminal but it failed because GitHub does no longer accepts taking passwords through here it only if you did it through vs code it opened up uh authentication window in the browser and it accepts authentication through the browser but if you push it through your terminal it will not accept passwords and usernames you have to put a username but you'll have to get",
  "you have to put a username but you'll have to get a token and to get a token from GitHub you'd have to um go here and say I believe it was sender settings and then if you go to the bottom here develop settings and then here you get personal access tokens you can go classic tokens and then you can say generate new token can generate a classic token okay it's asking for authentication so I to do that again but basically it's a long convoluted process right so to avoid all this you can just um use",
  "right so to avoid all this you can just um use vs code to connect to GitHub and it's just simple 3 right and then we can see TDS Tuesday [Music] toen and then you have to tell what permissions you want to give this token so I'll just for now just put all this and say yeah I want all the permissions typically you just read through these okay and uh decide what is appropriate and what's not appropriate just to avoid any complications for today okay so generate token and you get a token here you",
  "so generate token and you get a token here you can see this right over here so you copy this and once you go away from this page you'll never see this token again it's lost forever or you'll just have to generate a new token okay so you can see make sure you copy this token you won't be able to see it again so we copied this token go straight back here and and um we go get push and we um use uh put the username and we paste our token in here taada it works now but it was a lot more convoluted",
  "it works now but it was a lot more convoluted right so but I've shown you both ways in case you're on a different machine you're not using vs code you're using ID eclipse or idle or some other ID you can at least know how the G how git works so you know completely how git works now so let's move on to the next thing any questions over everything's fine right I know it's a bit fast but hopefully it's clear anyone who didn't understand what was going on okay okay great so I just verify that this",
  "on okay okay great so I just verify that this is worked as expected I go get out and we look at uh DDS J I thought oh okay right never mind it was main branch but I pushed something onto Master Branch okay so now there are actually two branches but I should have actually pushed to main so yeah okay right I'm going to delete this one oh that's the active bch all default [Music] active okay right I think it's we now on this Branch right only mean yes okay let's try and push back to this branch",
  "yes okay let's try and push back to this branch this is interesting I don't know why this says Master that's okay we'll not worry about this now but um typically okay we not worry about that now but uh keep keep it consistent whatever Branch you're pushing to keep it consistent and just like I said if you use code then you don't have to worry too much about branching and things of this right now the very first thing is we have got to get a server running okay uh a server that delivers end",
  "server running okay uh a server that delivers end points so that's what we're going to do next we do script so anyone knows what I'm doing now you can open your mic and talk UV yep that's exactly right I'm putting UV so UV requires metadata remove this bit over here a question here Caron yeah so so the question here is in order to like for example we are we are mentioning these requirements which which which should be like whatever the require project requirement will be there it will be",
  "project requirement will be there it will be completed by UI so my question is for example if we are doing these things we need to run the UV like we need to run this script in the UV environment if my understanding is correct is there something like that yes so the script you're running okay um so before I get to that uh your question um right now what I'm going to do is the reason I'm showing you this now is in your project you're going to be delivering a server okay that's effectively your",
  "delivering a server okay that's effectively your goal okay what does This Server do it responds to two end points okay one Endo is can can those of you have done worked on the project can you tell me what the one end point is one end point will receive the qu from the user and another will petch the file from the back end and correct so there are two end points and if we go thanks for that who was that AES okay thanks AES so um there are two end points that your server has to respond to okay",
  "points that your server has to respond to okay and you can see that over here and in fact you can see it in evaluation so one is this Endo right and the other is this end point so that's what we got to create but how does this server run you needed to uh run this python file that we creating the python file will create this server that is going to deliver these endpoints the technology we're going to use to run the python file is called UV why because U U is able to without pip installing and",
  "because U U is able to without pip installing and doing all these sorts of things UV is a is a complete package manager it's able to take a python file it's able to look at the dependencies get the dependencies install the dependencies create the virtual environment launch the server it's able to do all these things so that's why we use UV because it's a fantastic package manager right there's no man is that available in vs code sorry is it available in vs code uh it's not vs code is just just",
  "in vs code uh it's not vs code is just just a this is only an ID what we call an ID it's a integrated developer environment this is just to edit files it's basically a glorified text editor that's what vs code is it has some extensions that makes it useful U but that's all it is okay but UV itself is a package that uh is a is a package that manages Python dependencies and python files so in order to install UV we have to pip install it so pip install UV cuz I don't think we have UV installed on",
  "UV cuz I don't think we have UV installed on here all right I need to install Python 3 as well okay install install so the reason why these are not on this system is because this is a clean fresh uh system okay so that I can show you these things from scratch I'm just hoping sir so U is compuls like code yeah yeah you will need u in order to not only run your server in that I can understand but say we are doing some other way like flas flas we can use U but the thing is if we are like importing",
  "use U but the thing is if we are like importing everything in a python file yeah uh do can we do like that or you should do UV compos see the reason to have UV on the system right in your oh I think we'll have some problem okay okay anyway so the the reason why uh it's important to have UV on the system okay because this is what will eventually get uh put on your uh Docker image okay so if your code doesn't uh know how to use UV then you could in theory write your server to launch a flash so",
  "in theory write your server to launch a flash so you could do that but uh then what will happen is the evaluate py is going to send some code okay send some tasks to your application those tasks will not run unless UV is running okay do you see the problem okay right okay we it won't be able to automate the code that is being generated cuz your your uh server will generate some some of its own unique code right through the llm or through some function calls it will generate something and in",
  "function calls it will generate something and in order to run those tasks or that code that you have not written but the llm has written how will it run it you know it we might need to pip install or it might need to create a virtual environment or any number of dependencies might be there and the other problem is if you pip install things and run them uh these sublet codes or these small little micro codes that are generated it may corrupt the rest of your system right but then your tasks that",
  "of your system right but then your tasks that you're running in the future are not going to work right because you don't know what the code is doing but the beauty of UV is it will run the code and whatever happens at the end of the day it will once it stops functioning it disposes of the virtual environment it created it's a complete package manager you see what I mean okay once the code stops running U disposes of the virtual environment that it created to run that piece of code so whatever",
  "it created to run that piece of code so whatever dependencies it f fetched also it will just get rid of them so anytime you run another UV task it will again get uh either from its cash or either from from the internet it will grab the fresh dependencies and it will then uh use your the code package it together run it once it finishes execution dispose of it so that's uh that's what you will do yeah yeah yeah yes okay okay yeah now I think we will have a problem because for some reason the this",
  "have a problem because for some reason the this um uh WSL package that I installed earlier which I didn't have time to test um there was some error with this dpkg application so I am not 100% sure UI will run or not but if it doesn't I'll just uh send this code over to J Who's in the session and then then he can run it on his system or I can um yeah no he will be able to run it on his system okay I apologize for this that we didn't have this virtual environment ready in time but uh we'll see",
  "environment ready in time but uh we'll see how it goes okay Caron I have one more question to ask if you may so so what I was asking for asking is for example like I'm working on my system yeah okay and do we need to create an virtual environment using the um UV you don't have to create any virtual environment UI takes care of it all so what my understanding is I I just have to create this script file and in the terminal I just have to install the UV and from there onwards if anything is",
  "the UV and from there onwards if anything is written there under that under that markdown that will be installed that will be the responsibility of UV yes and every time if for example if I've done half the thing then again I'm opening that thing in that particular folder the UV will still be there I need not to run it once again yeah yeah okay yeah okay um right let's um okay so in order to create um a basic server which responds to endpoints so okay and then um we'll have to so we create a",
  "so okay and then um we'll have to so we create a fast API object we will need um to make sure that it can uh get requests oops we can get requests from anywhere so we'll do app. add where so this enables it to get cross domain requests because we don't know what uh the tasks will require and so this uh this over here uh you need to be a tell it what methods are allowed okay so there's the get method uh for get requests and there's the post method for post requests hopefully I don't have to",
  "for post requests hopefully I don't have to explain what these are um do we want delete no I don't think we want delete yeah just get in post requests okay and then um allow headers and then we want ERS from any any location okay so this allows header and this allows from all Origins uh and what else this commas here here yeah okay that's fine okay so that's uh that and then we need to check if our server is running so I usually like to have uh a dummy endpoint which tells if our server is",
  "uh a dummy endpoint which tells if our server is running so it's easy to know if the connectivity is correct so this is something most students forget okay uh but this is actually a a great thing to have they straight away go working on some complex solution without just checking basic connectivity so and all this will return return is yay T [Music] Tuesday is awesome okay right that's all it will return and um then [Music] [Music] if so one thing is I'm not getting um what you call for that U",
  "is I'm not getting um what you call for that U AI assistance CU I haven't installed the uh haven't installed the extension for it so but if you've installed um I think it's GitHub co-pilot and codium these two I would recommend codium or GitHub pilot uh it's very very good um so it's c o d e i is it c o d i I think it's called we'll just we'll just double check it here but it's very worth it okay if you guys don't know about this it's super super awesome Cod so there's a fake one and there's a",
  "awesome Cod so there's a fake one and there's a real one okay maybe it's not let's try that one this is the one okay so don't put c o ium okay it's c o d e that's the uh correct one so 2.2 million users five stars I mean that's amazing okay uh you C so uvon is the U server that will launch the fast API um app so what's happening here is uh we're launching this app it will at the moment only respond to this particular endpoint which is just the home endpoint and we are telling what uh address to",
  "endpoint and we are telling what uh address to run this server on and we're putting the server on 000000 if you don't know anything about IP addresses this particular IP address means it is available to any anyone on your local machine okay so then we give it a port number and it'll run on Port 8,000 so it'll respond uh to anyone on this machine and it will respond to this particular Port 48,000 okay so I think we done getting a basic server running which is good now let's Let's test this shall",
  "which is good now let's Let's test this shall we so control now this part I'm not sure is going to run the main reason is I'm not sure that the V the WSL has worked correctly because when I was installing UV some errors cropped up so I have a suspicion this is not going to work so the command for running UV is UV run and I believe the file name app.py and then oh yeah s it's app colon app sorry you run app colon then app because no that's for uvon right yeah but s is running UV yeah I'm running",
  "right yeah but s is running UV yeah I'm running UV yeah it's just um UV run app.py but the problem is it hasn't installed correctly on here so what I'll do is U I think GJ will take over at the moment because this um VM that I installed has some errors on it so I can't demonstrate this here um I'll push this file across to J and then he'll be able to run it so just give us a second [Music] here this one I not okay that's [Music] [Music] weird so over here right uh this is no [Music] it's let me",
  "over here right uh this is no [Music] it's let me let me just rename this sorry I I I wrote all of this I all of this and language and result and then I saw what I not that okay so J will take over from here and run the file okay and demonstrate it for you so while he's uh just getting his system up and running yeah you got it yeah okay that's fine and then while he's just getting ready to run that file you guys have any questions meanwhile because the next step will be uh once uh he got gets",
  "the next step will be uh once uh he got gets the server running we're going to push this image no we're going to create a Docker image we're going to push the docker image onto Docker we're going to pull that image back and then we're going to run that Docker image so that will be the next steps uh so can we complete A1 task yeah yeah we will complete A1 as well yeah sir yeah sir how much time it will take to complete the this project figure totally dependent on you brother I cannot say how",
  "totally dependent on you brother I cannot say how much time it will take right okay I mean if you're good at function calling and uh working with then it will take you maybe a day I would say or two days yes go ahead yeah can you show me how to call effectively H how to yeah we will do that as well okay it yeah okay meanwhile while he's getting it up and ready next thing let's have a look at our to-do list [Music] today right yeah so once we get the server running we will show you how how to",
  "the server running we will show you how how to create The Bard and upload and pull the Pod then the next uh aspect of it will be uh creating um uh and creating the API call to run task A1 which is um running the data genp so before we start codes that I'll explain what that is and I'll explain what evaluate. POI does and um then we will show you the how to code um at least A1 so that you're aware of how to get to the first step because without running task A1 you won't be able to run any other",
  "task A1 you won't be able to run any other [Music] tasks okay so he's ready and uh he will take over from here okay soton have already created this application am okay so I will just execute it this it will be PR easy let's I think we'll need to import it um I don't remember the Imports integration fast API like you can us the promt I usually yes yes you can use this are you trying to integrate course in this H yeah I'll send you the code wait I'm sending it on chat okay um I think now we have",
  "sending it on chat okay um I think now we have integrated codes let's try to run it again name uorn is unic okay oh sure sure sure okay now this application is running so let's check if we are able to access it through local host or not it's running on 8,000 yeah so now it is accessible through browser [Music] okay okay so now what I will be doing I will be putting this code to something called Docker file that will create a Docker image which can be pushed to dockerhub and then later it can be",
  "be pushed to dockerhub and then later it can be pulled from dockerhub so Docker is basically a repository similar to GitHub but instead of we will be having a whole image so just pull it and execute it h is this correct name so uh what are the things that we need to install basically in order to run this application for project one we need python to be installed in our container and we also need UV to be installed so I will just type UV talker and I will go over here uh so this code it will get",
  "I will go over here uh so this code it will get python from this particular image that might be on dockerhub or some other repository and then it will uh run some commands to install UV and at the end it will create some binaries so once we have UV and python both installed what is the other task that we want to do we actually want to put this uh can you tell us where like like tell me where you have sourced all these things from like the file which is there uh so I have got it from the UV",
  "which is there uh so I have got it from the UV official documentation MH so just typed UV Space Docker and then I went to this particular URL and over here uh this is the one Le four or six yeah so it's very important that you use Docker file okay for this um because there are lots of things on that install but this particular piece of code is what you need so just be aware that this is the piece that you need to in order to create your Docker image uh so we also need this particular file in in",
  "uh so we also need this particular file in in our Docker container and then we uh right now what we have we have Python and we have UV right after these two things what we need we so UV doesn't require these dependencies if this file is there it can actually run by just typing UV run and then name of the file so in Docker file we just need this tuore appy [Music] right there is a way we can copy any file from our local machine to this stalker container so I will use copy command and now I will",
  "so I will use copy command and now I will mention the name of the file and then where we want to um Kumar mute yourself okay so what this would do this would copy tuore oh Pi should be there so it will copy this file to the root of your uh Docker container so in case if instead of putting it inside root folder if you want to put it somewhere else then we can create create a working directory I think it is W KD work so this will create a new uh folder or repository inside uh the container and",
  "folder or repository inside uh the container and now I want to copy this file to that folder and after copying maybe we can call it app. or else we can keep the same name so now we have python installed UV installed and then we have also copied this particular file now the next thing that we want to do is we want to execute this file from container so for that we'll use this command so over here I will need list the commands that needs to be executed du eore app. Pi so this is the docker file",
  "du eore app. Pi so this is the docker file that will build a [Music] image I we just stop the server and now we will use podman so before I have already configured this podman but if you want to configure it then you can go to this installation page and then if it is Linux machine since we are working it inside a WSL so you would need to install I think this dbn version because we have installed open tool this is the command that we need to execute to uh install podman into the system uh once",
  "to uh install podman into the system uh once you install podman you would have to authenticate it so that is easy command to do that so if I just do podman login so it will actually ask me to log in since I have already logged in it will just tell I have already logged in and credentials are there so now what we will do will um now I now I will actually build this image podman build and I will add a tag to this image to identify it and we can call it TDS QD and is there something else and then",
  "it TDS QD and is there something else and then we need to put from where we in this Docker file where is this Docker file is available so I'm putting dot to indicate current working directory okay there is no Docker file okay it should be a small F instead of capital F so it is first getting the image from python to install Python and then it is running these tasks to install um I think some certification okay it is installing curl and yeah now it is installing UV so once it builds the image we",
  "is installing UV so once it builds the image we can look for all the available images by typing podman images so it tells the repository of that image so if it is uh pulled from Docker Hub then it will tell docker.io and then this is the actual path so this is the python image that we have used to build our Custom Image so we have used that python image over here and then this is this is our image which is which is on Local Host and this is the name so now we have image ID what we want to do we",
  "so now we have image ID what we want to do we want to run a podman container so so before uh we had the system running uh locally on our system okay the server was running on our system now what we are going to do is we're going to have the uh server run from inside the doc image okay so that's uh what's going to happen and you may ask well why do we want it to run inside Docker it's already running on our local system so why do we want it inside Docker can anyone answer that question for me I",
  "Docker can anyone answer that question for me I mean apart from the fact that it is required for project what's the actual reason why do we want it inside why do we want the server running inside Docker image or inside a Docker image just open your mic and speak for processing the images and translating their text and understanding them sorry say come again [Music] please I said just for getting the transcript from the images and understanding and getting meaningful insights from them no no",
  "and getting meaningful insights from them no no that's not the not the reason why do we want why do we want a server inside a Docker image we do not want any personal changes to our image or app so it Mains an copy of an image that's right okay so anyone else anyone else has a can you tell me a reason Okay so so the reason we have the server running inside a Docker image is because now it becomes distributable right you can distribute the server anywhere it can be deployed anywhere that's why",
  "anywhere it can be deployed anywhere that's why we run the server inside a Docker image it doesn't matter if it's a Macbook it doesn't matter if it's a Windows Server it doesn't matter if it's a Linux server you can run your server or your service on any system anywhere in the world so that's why we put it inside a Docker image a second reason we run it inside a Docker image is if your server crashes or if it does something that it's not supposed to do or if it um has some issues only that",
  "to do or if it um has some issues only that image gets damaged it doesn't damage the server or the machine it's running on it's completely in that sense isolated now it's not perfect security but it is much better than running it on your local system because our project if you if you remember it'll do do all sorts of tasks it'll be creating files it'll be modifying files and the code itself maybe is not being generated by human beings it will be regenerated by a machine and we have no control",
  "regenerated by a machine and we have no control over what that code is being generated right so that's why if you put it inside a Docker image it can do whatever it wants as soon as the docker image uh is stopped then it disappears it doesn't affect your local system at all so this is the value of putting it inside a Docker image so so that's why we have created this server inside the do image okay right okay Carry On so now next what jaraj is going to show you is he's got this image he's going",
  "to show you is he's got this image he's going to run this Docker image okay he's going to it's like starting a computer he's going to start a Mini Server and it's going to be your server that's going to be running from inside this document so before if you remember he ran it from his local machine and you could access it so now he's going to show you how to run it and he will explain how you connect to it because now it is a separate machine in of itself Okay carry on and now we need to put the",
  "itself Okay carry on and now we need to put the image ID so it have started the machine we can say and after starting the machine then it will this machine already have Python and UV installed but in order to run this command it will install few dependencies that are there so now it have install all of this let's try to get it okay okay okay we won't be able to access it right now that is because uh right now I haven't set up a connection so it is running inside a Docker container right but I",
  "is running inside a Docker container right but I want to access this port number outside Docker container so we don't have visibility to this port number outside the container so for that we will have to put the port number I will rerun this image but this time I will mention the port number is it port or Dash PE so I will map 8,000 of my local machine to 8,000 of do container so that now it can send a request from make 1 5,000 okay um so on my local machine I will keep it 5,000 and on in doer",
  "local machine I will keep it 5,000 and on in doer we will keep it 8,000 that is because uh we have 8,000 here H sure T so now let's try to access uh 5,000 it will be because on our local machine it's already 5,000 okay yes so now we are able to communicate with the docker image and so are there any questions what's happened at this point is it clear what's what this command has done do you understand what's happening if you didn't understand just speak up sir I don't understand okay so your",
  "just speak up sir I don't understand okay so your Docker is running the server you understood that right yes sir okay do you see on the screen where it says uvon running HTTP 0000 8000 do you see that yes sir okay inside your Docker machine you remember our code said that we are running the server on 8,000 correct yes sir okay but the 0000 is only for the local device that the server is running on okay but now it is not running directly on your local machine it is running inside a Docker image",
  "local machine it is running inside a Docker image which is fully self-contained it is not visible to anyone else except the applications inside the docker image when it was running on your computer I know right now it's running also on the computer only but I want you to think about this imagine this Docker file is not running on Jr's machine it is running on my machine now you imagine he cannot see this number 00 8,000 why because it is not on his machine anymore right it's running on my",
  "on his machine anymore right it's running on my machine right so only I can see this application correct you understood that right so yes so Docker is like running it on someone else's machine you no longer have visibility to what's happening inside that machine okay so the question is how do you get visibility to what's happening inside Docker how do you get access to that service that is on Port 8,000 inside the machine and the answer to that is if you look at the code that is written up",
  "is if you look at the code that is written up there wman run- P 5,000 8,000 you see that 5,000 call in 8,000 yes sir so 8,000 there is the port that is inside the machine which which machine the docker machine the docker image that is the 8,000 that is running inside the docker image but on our computer where we want to access that service we saying map all the functions from that internal machine which is running on 8,000 map it to our machine which is 5,000 000 we want to access it on our",
  "which is 5,000 000 we want to access it on our browser our machine at 5 Port 5,000 so it's a bridge a bridge from the from the docker to the bridge that is on our local machine that bridge connection allows us then to connect through 5port 5000 on our computer did you understand that now how that works yes sir okay so that's what it is thank you sir s so just to condense you said that that 8 000 just shows that the particular the particular code is being run on our our machinery and when we use",
  "is being run on our our machinery and when we use podman it converts that 8,000 to 5,000 and could be used by anyone is it something like that um okay let me I'll just illustrate it I've done a session on this before actually but uh I'll just illustrate it for so that it's just a bit easier visually if I show it to you just give me one second uh yes delin by the you were going to ask something is it something related or you want to add it yeah I want to add one thing so here the P has been",
  "I want to add one thing so here the P has been forwarded right to right yes that's the correct word for it yeah so I have a doubt in know project they have given like 8,000 8,000 right so in that case what will happen so that will so what so that's why I'll show you on the U visually what what's happening so that it's a bit more clear yeah okay visible okay so this is the doer books this is the docker image okay your server is running a service okay on this port 8,000 okay but this is visible",
  "okay on this port 8,000 okay but this is visible only to applications that are inside this machine you can imagine this machine as some a computer a separate computer okay so 8 so if this say for example there is this application here uh that requires a service from this server then it will only only be able to access it via this port 8,000 but it's only visible to the applications inside this computer to give you an example when it was not running inside Docker I imagine this was your uh",
  "running inside Docker I imagine this was your uh initially we had made this computer right and U you were running it from WSL so even though we were running app. it's called Tuesday app right so even though we were running tuesday. py and it was running 00 8,000 right even though it was running on 8,000 what was the application we were running we were running a browser right but this browser could see that remember I I will need some auditory cues from you guys to know make sure you're",
  "cues from you guys to know make sure you're understanding the browser is a part of the Machinery itself huh browser is part of this machine okay okay so that's why it can access it any application can access this 8,000 B why because we have said Put it on 0000 and 0000 means available on the local network okay and where it's accessible to this port 8,000 so all applications can access this but when we put it inside Docker right what's happening is we are isolating it you can think of it as a",
  "is we are isolating it you can think of it as a double wall like this okay we are isolating it from the rest of your machine for all intentions and purposes it cannot connect now to it this is is like as if this is a separate machine now we have packaged it in we have packaged the server inside a Docker container the whole point of the container is it's an isolated machine so whatever it does inside is not going to affect anything that is inside your machine here it's not going to affect but",
  "your machine here it's not going to affect but also equally none of these applications now inside your computer including your browser cannot access this machine now this Docker image do you understand the separation now hello so what is the use for like what is the purpose for doing this okay so the purpose for separating this okay is now I'll give you a good good good example okay the purpose for separating this is now uh we uh now six uh around 1, 600 students will submit their application",
  "1, 600 students will submit their application to us okay we're going to stick it on our server do we know what it's going to do no right is it safe for us to run we don't know is there a virus on it we don't know right is it going to damage our files on the server we don't know how do we run it safely now do you see the value isolated ah the value in isolating it we've isolated it so that it cannot be accessed it cannot access anything on our system and we cannot access it directly but we still",
  "and we cannot access it directly but we still need to communicate with it right we still need to send it some tasks because U ostensibly I written this program okay and I've told you hey run this program it will do this task for you you can think of it like Outsourcing right you're a big defense contractor you're Outsourcing um the building of some components uh to this company okay uh but you want a limited contact you don't want this outsourced uh group to have full access to your defense",
  "uh group to have full access to your defense military apparatus right you want them to only provide you the service is required and he needs only access to the things he needs to know correct so we need to build a communication bridge between these two right a carefully controlled Bridge so that's what we do we will make a hole here right and now I will say this port 8,000 that's on the inside actually I should put it the other way around but anyway this port 8,000 that's on the inside I want",
  "this port 8,000 that's on the inside I want to communicate only via this port and on the outside I've got lots of other things that I'm communicating with on the outside I want to communicate VI Port 5,000 so now sudden ly your browser which could not see 8,000 before it could not see this 8,000 before now the browser via 5,000 is able to communicate inside your Docker machine did you understand yes sir okay so that's what that command does um so when you say podman and you give it the um run",
  "so when you say podman and you give it the um run command and you give it the dash p um uh the dash p u parameter you tell it hey I want to communicate with this Docker container on Port 5000 but inside the docker container the application itself that I'm communicating with runs on Port 8,000 so build this bridge for me so that's why we we run that command we say um [Music] bman run run right yeah dasb and uh we say 5,000 8,000 and then of course the image name okay so that's how it works so",
  "the image name okay so that's how it works so it's clear now I hope right so now you able to run this safely and you're able to communicate from your browser which is Port it doesn't have to be 5,000 okay it could be 8,000 also if you look at the um if you look at the uh specification on uh TDS for the project there it says use 8,000 itself so there it's directly mapped 8,000 to 8,000 I deliberately asked jaj to show you 5,000 so that you understand what is actually happening internally so that",
  "what is actually happening internally so that you you are better able to appreciate the separation that is there between the docker image and your physical machine in his case it's running on his physical machine but that is that separation and we bridge that separation using ports to communicate okay Carry On You okay now we are running this squadman container [Music] okay uh now if I just to control C then it will actually stop that container and now if I to podman PS this will get us the",
  "and now if I to podman PS this will get us the information about all the active containers which are running currently so right now okay so uh here G is showing you some something else that is important and a place where many students had issues so in one of the G if you remember you had to have a running Docker container uh in order to submit your GA okay because your uh container was not running in some cases your G were not succeeding in the checks why because your application or your pod",
  "checks why because your application or your pod man was not running either on the port that was required or it was not running at all so how do you check it's running your server or your pod image you check it this way so that is the purpose of checking it this way and uh yeah carry on so this will display us all the active podman containers which are running right now so right now there is nothing that is active uh because we have finished this this particular process uh we have shut it down",
  "this particular process uh we have shut it down right so we have shut down that particular container or we can call it machine so now we'll see which all containers were previously running or are running it this this minus a it will list all the containers which were either earlier running or they are right now running but right now there is nothing that is running so whatever it will get us will be the older containers right so this is one container that is running and then this is another",
  "that is running and then this is another container no not right now we have run it earlier actually this is the one that we run earlier without bridging ports and then this is the one which we run later with the the port connection right so now we have this container ID we can actually restart this stopped container or this is similar to like we used to shut down our machine by clicking over here and then it will just shut down our machine so stopping a container is similar to shutting it down",
  "a container is similar to shutting it down and you want to restart your machine not restart you you want to power on your machine then you can run podman start and then the ID of that particular container this would restart our container all right now it doesn't show uh something like this so we don't get any information about like uh it is down loing this or this server is running right but if I try to access it through browser since we are running on the same port 5,000 we send a request oh",
  "on the same port 5,000 we send a request oh so can someone say why it was not running so we use the previous one used the previous image which ran the container but didn't have a port map to the outside world right as in to our machine so therefore we cannot access anything inside the Pod M so that's a good demonstration thank you J okay okay so right now we are running that particular machine actually at the same time we can run multiple machines so right now if I just do podman and then PS it",
  "so right now if I just do podman and then PS it will show us all the active Machin so this is the one that is running right now but I I won't uh turn it off I that means I I won't shut it down I will start one more machine what is the command podman start and then container ID okay so now we have a started this container which have this bridging so now it should work yeah it is working so that's the thing we can actually create multiple containers and then they can parall run so both of them",
  "and then they can parall run so both of them are running at the same time and now actually I don't need this container because it doesn't serve my purpose of linking to Outer world so I will just stop this particular container stop and then container ID so this machine will shut down okay uh but we have sent a request to this particular uh the other machine that is running which which is the other one this one but we don't get any information about what is happening in that machine whenever I'm",
  "what is happening in that machine whenever I'm trying to access this particular Endo earlier it was sending this get request and then it was telling if if it was a success request or some failure whatever it is but right now we don't have any information of that but that is a way we can get information about um what is happening within a container so that is podman logs and then ID of that container right so this is that container so earlier it have downloaded few things that is because we had",
  "have downloaded few things that is because we had executed UV uh right and then it started the server and we did not uh we we executed few commands after that we shuted it down and then we had restarted it so right now is it running or server finished um if I I send one request over here and then if I get the log okay it's not getting me the log I think I'm again using wrong container ID let me check PS yes I'm using wrong container ID that is log of the other machine which we haven't networked",
  "of the other machine which we haven't networked so this display is uh we have started the machine and then we sent few request then we shuted it down after that we restarted it and right now it's running so now if I send one more request sure so if you notice something now right these logs are from inside the Pod man okay inside that machine so what can it see right if you look at the log can you see the the IP address it's coming from 10.0.2 100 so podman or this image does not or your server",
  "so podman or this image does not or your server does not know what's happening in the outside world all it sees is some information is coming via Port 8,000 uh to itself and it's coming from this address 10.0.2 100 which happens to be Jr machine and it is coming via different different different port numbers that's because of the way um the network is structured okay so incoming requests coming but it's coming into podman but the important thing here to notice is podman doesn't know what's",
  "here to notice is podman doesn't know what's happening outside he doesn't know the environment it's in it is completely isolated from the outside world so from its point of view this is what it can see so do you do you see this difference right I hope hope you guys understand what I'm saying yeah okay thanks D at least someone's someone's giving thumbs up others are not so sure is it okay okay Carry On sir sir I have a question sir yeah yeah sir my friend is running sorry sir my yeah my friend",
  "my friend is running sorry sir my yeah my friend is running a container suppose so how can I access it h you can't access your friend's container right it depends on where the container is running unless your friend how can I how can I send request to the machine so that depends where so if you're running your friend's container is that what you're saying sir could you explain it a bit more sir my friend is running a container okay online so sir how can I send request to the machine to his",
  "sir how can I send request to the machine to his container or to his machine to his container is what you're asking how do you send a request to his container so for that he has to build a bridge from his container to the outside world wherever that outside world is so if it is um so this is where a little bit of networking knowledge will help okay uh and it's a little bit beyond the scope of uh is showing it for today's session but uh if we have some time not anytime soon uh but say sometime",
  "some time not anytime soon uh but say sometime next week or the week after we can discuss these things in more detail but that's effectively what happens is I'll tell you in short what happens he will have to create a first of all a bridge from that Docker that he's running onto his local machine then from his local machine he has to create another Bridge Okay from his machine to the internet okay and once that bridge is created on the inter you also have to open up a firewall Port as well uh",
  "also have to open up a firewall Port as well uh then once that bridge is created there then from anywhere in the world you can access the docker container so that has to follow a two-step process one quick way to get around that is to use enro which is what uh is called tunneling which is uh making it making your uh container accessible via enro so that is one way to create this bridge and so now if you look uh jivaraj has now opened up an enr app with this container running and he is going to",
  "with this container running and he is going to open it to the outside world and now anyone of you can uh as soon as it's ready will be able to access this uh Docker that he's running from inside uh his machine okay so it's uh running now okay so you see this URL right if you guys try this out right right try this out now we have a double bridge the first Bridge was the Pod man which connects the machine uh to his local machine to the docker image the second bridge he made was using enro to open",
  "the second bridge he made was using enro to open his local machine to the outside world and that's what he has pasted in the um window for you so if you access it now from your browser you should be able to access this very Docker image that is now currently running on this machine yeah so that's 48,000 to 5,000 and then that's 5,000 to the internet right go ahead let's see who someone stand telin yeah go ahead telin just one second sir sir these connections actually what you are telling uh and",
  "connections actually what you are telling uh and we need to learn and all like that can you put these ones as a small small Snippets in the in the uh what we have discussed earlier is putting in a web space I mean Google space kind of thing where you can give the links and we will learn through that one by going into the going to that particular website and learning a bit of that one yeah we will put some resources for you it won't be imminent but it will we will put some resources I'll make",
  "but it will we will put some resources I'll make some I'll take make some notes that you want some resources for it okay please sir please sir okay I hope it's been useful so far is so useful but but the thing is naturally after this class we may forget that one and if you wanted to uh tweak the things in a proper manner yes uh it would be useful with just just more information regarding that sure and tunneling and I know it very well and I'm asking you to pipeline the total stream of the",
  "asking you to pipeline the total stream of the information to us in our machine learning language I talk you sure sure thank you sir okay right I made a note of it okay sir uh just one thing uh While submitting the project do we have to run uh do we have do we need this uh podman uh Docker images running to into a system no no because what we will do is we will pull your Docker image see that's that's why the have we pushed Docker image yet no okay so the next thing we are going to show you is",
  "so the next thing we are going to show you is so we shown you how to run the docker image so that you can test your application but next step now we're going to show you is we're going to push this Docker image to a repository okay called Docker Hub then you will we will show you how to pull it from there so what will happen is when you submit it there and you will fill up a form for your project you will give us the URL of where your Docker image is hosted so that you don't have to keep",
  "image is hosted so that you don't have to keep running your Docker image what we will do is we'll take a copy of your Docker image from the repository where it is kept we will run it on our server and we will test it out so you don't have to keep your Docker images running okay Kelvin you have another question or yeah so I had a question so here we are exposing 5,000 Port right yes like okay so in my case my WSL is using 8,000 Port yes and I am exposing my app in 8,000 Port so it's not running",
  "exposing my app in 8,000 Port so it's not running so in that yes how will this it's not running is it yeah uh we'll have to see what command you're running I'm not sure if you have run the command correctly no I took the solution and I shut down my and I ran from local only but I am asking so in Project it's mention 8,000 8,000 correct so that's it just want I mean if you if you run the command EX exactly as we told you right it should work you will be able to access it on your local machine",
  "will be able to access it on your local machine okay yeah just make sure the order of the numbers are correct okay the first number is the uh local machine as in the machine you want to access from the second number is the number of the docker machine so the do Port that the docker server is running on just make sure we are using 8,000 that if you use both 8,000 then you will have no issues you can still access it the only time you will have a problem the only time you will have a problem is if",
  "the only time you will have a problem is if that boort is being used by something else already then you you then you will have a problem so if there is some other service running on your computer somewhere that is using 8,000 then you will have an issue so by default WSL will use right there's no such default it is just something we have chosen arbitr we can change it to anything else you know we could make it ,01 or any other um Port whatever you like but the only thing is for the sake of",
  "you like but the only thing is for the sake of project we require you to run it on 8,000 uh as in your code should at least run it on you can test your code on any other number okay if you want to run it on 10,000 I think the maximum is like 65,000 or something okay you can R run it on any port number you want that's not occupied on a machine but before submitting your code and packaging it as a Docker image make sure that you change it back to 8,000 because we will test on 8,000 okay okay",
  "to 8,000 because we will test on 8,000 okay okay could you show like which which is actually running in 8,000 Port yeah there is a command uh you can run on your system it dep depends on your uh if you're running in Windows or if you're running in WSL both those have different sets of commands to check what uh ports are currently being used so J is uh typing it for you now on the screen so if you you can use net stat is one of them I think or SS also is another one I think the options are the",
  "also is another one I think the options are the wrong ones there Che so net stat you would use N St a dash t l NP so the T stands for TCP connections U stands for UDP connections L stands for listening ports so that tells you all the ports that are currently listening so listening means an application is waiting for some information to come on those ports okay so you can see over here right what all ports are being listened on so one you can see is 53 53 is uh typically used for uh I believe it",
  "is 53 53 is uh typically used for uh I believe it is email I'm not entirely sure um then there's a way to look what these ports are commonly used for as well so if you look commonly used ports yeah so okay DNS so domain name so so the when you're whenever you type something in your browser right if you type google.com that's a domain name but your machine doesn't know where to go for uh google.com What is the number of google.com so it looks up so it looks up a server to tell the address of",
  "up so it looks up a server to tell the address of google.com so it sends that request on Port 53 so that is what P 53 is so like that there are other ports that are in use you can look them up what ports on your computer open and incidentally there's a good way to find if something nefarious is going on on your computer there's some application that's misbehaving or something and you don't recognize why these ports are being used that's a good indication that there is some application that's",
  "indication that there is some application that's doing some dodgy stuff on your computer but it's opened up a port that you're not aware of Sir uh sir sir can we get back to the project like yes yeah yeah okay so the next step is now uh we are going to to create we're going to push the uh podman image to the uh Docker Hub okay because this is required for your project so for pushing a local image to Docker Hub I will need username I don't remember my username sign in let me create a Appo and",
  "my username sign in let me create a Appo and what should be the name of Ru tdst tdst du and let's create the repo and let's keep it public for now so once we get um it we can actually copy this particular piece of code and I can paste it oh so podman and doer they are both command line tools and they work exactly same all those commands which are available for Docker are available for podman as well and what is this tag one actually let us say you want to create versions of your application so",
  "want to create versions of your application so this is how you can do you can keep V1 for the first version of your application and then V2 for second version of your application and then that particular version can be pulled using Docker pull image not known TDS image not known okay let me ask GPT I did I configure it e is why so this problem is because we are telling uh I need to push to this particular repo but uh we are not telling which particular image we want to push so let me list down",
  "image we want to push so let me list down all the images uh this is the image that you want to push so I don't exactly know the code uh so we would if the image exist has a different name then we'll need to use this okay so we need this command image ID oh that was very fast did it push it I want to push let's have a look at doer images uh we have this image I think we need to put Docker IU over here then maybe it will push to Docker instead of Local Host [Music] I want to push I'll past it in",
  "Local Host [Music] I want to push I'll past it in the window oh right now I have just tagged it so I will have to uh push itage ID and we have tagged it so now let me push this image odman images so we have d i and then frent then R TDS and version one so let's push this image existing let's check if it have pushed H yeah now we have pushed this image and now if I look at the version one and uh this is the version of image and we can actually pull this image back to our system I think we need",
  "this image back to our system I think we need to put let me try pulling it so right now we have these images so modman pull and then the name of the images it is from dockerhub and then usern name is JT and now TDS hyphen view is the name of that image and I want version one from it so before we pull it again we actually have the same uh image this particular image so we will delete this particular image so that there is no confusion I think we can delete these two images because they have same",
  "delete these two images because they have same image ID [Applause] anyway um man RMI and um I will have to use unable to delete this pick my ID with more than one tag please Force REM so now all those three images have been deleted this is the python image that we had installed so now I will pull the image from docker use why are they giving like tag name uh we are giving tag name so that if there is this version one you have multiple version of your images right so you can pull a particular",
  "of your images right so you can pull a particular version from there I have already logged in so why it is asking for credentials again anra 18 is the username yes this is correct login doer. IU and sure you log out first and then you log in again and R okay while um CH is um sorting that out uh the next thing I want to mention is that um you should in the Google form so I'll just share my screen meanwhile while he's getting that sorted out sh okay so uh in in the project page am I am I audible",
  "so uh in in the project page am I am I audible hello hello yes sir you are audible yeah okay so in the project page uh many people miss this okay they ask where do I submit my project or how do I send project it's under deliverables there is this line here that says submit in this Google form and in this Google form is where you submit your project there is uh this is the how you get your project evaluated you must submit this form and you put uh your GitHub repo name over here and you put your",
  "your GitHub repo name over here and you put your Docker uh image name over here so it should be in this form okay username slash image name so don't put whole Docker iio slash this that no just put username SL image name so whatever your username is and the name of your image so put that in here we will pass it from our end on our server we'll automatically run a script that will be looking for these two things okay so just remember to do that and um uh the next uh thing if we are not able to",
  "and um uh the next uh thing if we are not able to so the pulling part is just to see if you are able to pull the image of the docker image so it's not important from the project point of view it doesn't matter but what does matter is um we you should push your image onto Docker okay and push your code uh commit and push your code onto um GitHub okay uh the next step is we're going to develop the server image that we have now because it responds to endpoints and we will try and show you how to",
  "to endpoints and we will try and show you how to do this first task now this first task is very important because this first task produces this um fetches this file called Data gen. py now some of you may think okay if my project cannot run without this uh without this data genpi I'll just sneakily uh just get this ahead of time and run it and do it the reason why that's not going to work for you is because this file will be changed when it comes time to running the actual evaluation so there's",
  "time to running the actual evaluation so there's no point in hardcoding this instead what you ought to do is and we will show you how to do this now shortly you will send this request whatever this request this kind of request that will come through your task end point which is this kind of endpoint slre um then this is a query parameter right question mark path equal to so to this end point or sorry not read sorry run it will be okay it'll be a run U endpoint to this endpoint we will send a",
  "a run U endpoint to this endpoint we will send a task and the task will be something like this install UV and run a script and uh it will have this parameter and that is what will come to your end point okay the so right now we only had one endpoint which had a slome right uh but now we will have two end points which we will show you one is to read the file and one is to uh run a task so running a task and reading a task the first task that will be executed is this A1 task okay and don't",
  "will be executed is this A1 task okay and don't hardcode this task because if you hardcode this task you will fail fail the project uh instead we will show you how to parametrically run this task so that what you need to extract you need to extract the URL of where the uh uh data generation file comes from because this file will generate all this you know the format. MD dates. text contacts. Json all these files it will randomly generated based on some key I suspect the key is going to be your",
  "on some key I suspect the key is going to be your user email that's why you to provide user email and um once it generates that text then you can run then your application will be able to run the other tasks so that's what we will be showing you next how to get uh A1 running uh yes ai go ahead sir actually I want to ask that the post request does not work on the Google Chrome as it uh only uh take get request so is it okay if we check the uh app with post request on the postman and if it",
  "uh app with post request on the postman and if it working post on Postman correctly then it will be working on the uh project for the assessment correct so in your browser from the URL you cannot send a post request it's not possible to do that I mean there are some hacky ways of doing it but that's not how this URL works okay anytime you enter something here right it's always going to be a get request but when you send a form or when you send some data to uh an application then uh it the",
  "some data to uh an application then uh it the application that is running in your browser that sends a post request okay but when you type something in the URL you cannot send a post request in the URL it's just not possible to do that you either have to use inspect tools and do it that way or through console or through a form or some other way but not through a URL it's not possible to do that okay and the whole reason why he's put a parameterized u uh query there is to make you aware that you",
  "u uh query there is to make you aware that you can't do it that way okay so that's not the way to solve it you cannot solve it by putting a post requesting your browser you have to use either um uh API client uh like thunder client or Postman or you can if you want you can even send uh write a program that sends a a post request also so you can send some headers and things along so you can write a little python program that sends requests either way is fine easiest way is of course through",
  "way is fine easiest way is of course through Thunder client or Postman okay ready no okay um okay um instead of showing you how to pull from Postman he will now just um demonstrate how to create the uh create the task all read and [Applause] task um dius so we'll create another uh get method for getting data from a file so it should be read and and it will get a parameter file path and that will be named as path so we'll put path over here and then string over here so this will get us all the",
  "then string over here so this will get us all the uh Ur URL and coded parameters so if you have question mark over here and then we put anything here for example q and then equal to um 1. Json or something then it will read this Q variable if I have a Q over here so now uh what we want to do you want to read this file so for reading this file I want to open this file with open and we want to open this path file and we want to open it in readable mode okay so and after that we also need to",
  "mode okay so and after that we also need to return we want return f. read so this will get us all the content of that yeah yeah as file I will have to read and I will have to put it inside a try uh Block in case if this particular file doesn't exist then it should raise some exception so I'll put it inside a tri block if it is successful then it won't do anything and then exception as e and now I will raise an exception [Music] they you push it okay wait a second I'm not seeing something so how",
  "wait a second I'm not seeing something so how do you read and exception in for epi so let's continue reading I think handling errors is this one so we need to use HTTP exception and we'll raise it like this so a status code would be 4 not4 that is because this particular file doesn't exist and details we can tell that file did not exist file does not exist okay so now we have created this particular endpoint I will just execute this file using UV on my local machine otherwise what I would have",
  "on my local machine otherwise what I would have to do I would have to create the image again and then we'll have to run r that image Tu app and this is running on 8,000 is it is still running oh okay I know I have shut it down now we want to go to read then we want both to be random. Json so this particular file doesn't exist on my machine so it says file doesn't exist and it would get in response it will have status code 44 right uh so if there is some file for example let's try to read this",
  "is some file for example let's try to read this toer file talker file so now it gets the content of that particular file so these tasks what they need to require is to do they want for example this need us to sort something and then we need to write the result to this particular file so whenever you do perform this task at the end it will read through this file if whatever you have done is correct or not this is to validate this read must be there in your application and then I will make a post",
  "in your application and then I will make a post request this is to execute any task we need run function and we want to pass this task as qu parameter so the way to read G parameter is we just put it within function so let's call it task Runner and it should be task and data type is string now whenever we get a task what we want to do we want to um actually see these are the two things that we had to do regarding reading so we have now we want to we'll get this task as an English sentence and",
  "to we'll get this task as an English sentence and then we'll have to execute it on our machine so now we'll send open a to write it code for us so for that we'll use request Library uh which we have already imported and I will need to import it and after importing we'll need to send a request to open um chat completions and then we also need to pass headers where we have token and then we need to pass the actual Json data which have uh prompt and what task needs to do and then the response",
  "and what task needs to do and then the response format and I will store response in response so what is the URL that we want to use URL we want to use is chat completions URL so during week three I have seen lot of students have made a common mistake uh they have used either open AIS python module or they have used some other um URL for sending request to but we need to use this particular URL which have ai proxy dos an so this is from an service proxy and I will Define headers now it should be",
  "proxy and I will Define headers now it should be content type um application Json and then authorization and this should be the token and over here it should be AI proxy _ token and this token you can get by going to this particular URL and if you will sign in then you will get a token which you can use so uh now actually we don't have visibility to this particular token at the moment so we need to get this token from the system so AI p xycore p n is equal to um I will use OS module to get this",
  "n is equal to um I will use OS module to get this token from the environment get EnV and the name of the token a i p r o x Yore token so I am keeping this name because uh when they will be running podman within podman we need we we will be able to access AI andore proxy so this is the name that must to be there if there is some other name for the environment variable then it won't work okay now we need to create data is equal to model we are going to use gp4 Mini and then we need to send",
  "going to use gp4 Mini and then we need to send messages and then there will be two messages user and user will provide task and actually GPT doesn't know about uh what we uh how that particular task needs to be executed so that's what we have to tell um so we will be having two functions uh one is script Runner and then the other one is Task Runner so what is script Runner would do okay for now we'll just focus on the first task so the reason why there are two uh primary tasks as I would call",
  "there are two uh primary tasks as I would call them is because uh if you look at the way project is designed project has a single script that will run in the beginning uh and it's an important task and then the rest are just various kinds of tasks that uh need to be done right so the first task is a data generation task the other tasks are either reading or they um running um various tasks that the user gives so this is by no means the only approach to do it you can choose any other approach",
  "to do it you can choose any other approach but we decided to use this approach because it is uh just simpler to demonstrate for you um the separation between these two tasks uh of course you can again like I said there is no one way to do it all you might come up with a better way or a simpler way but we thought this might serve the purpose well so that's why we have two tasks or sorry two functions in particular that we will run one is called Script Runner and the whole point of script Runner",
  "Runner and the whole point of script Runner is to install a package and run a script from a URL with some provided arguments so if you looked at uh the tools in data science the website with the project you see task A1 and task A1 you basically what it is it needs to pick up a file right it needs to pick up a script uh and it is from a location so one of the parameters that we have to give to it is a script URL and the other one is the arguments for the script so in this case there is only one",
  "for the script so in this case there is only one argument but this can be a well defined function we don't have to necessarily have GPT right code for us to run this script right to pick up a pick up where the script is from and what uh the argument is we don't need GPT to create code to run it but we do need GPT to parse the task itself as in extract the URL and the user email from this uh from this uh uh task that the user has given us so that's the first task the script Runner we call it",
  "the first task the script Runner we call it because we are going to take the script and run the script the second um uh function that we will run is called a task Runner so these are all the other tasks that will be um these are all the other tasks that will be running which are from A2 onwards so that will be handled by task R so how does GPT decide that is what is J is going to demonstrate for you so I will put the prompt you are an assistant who has to do a variety of tasks if your task",
  "who has to do a variety of tasks if your task invols running a script and if you want want to run some other task other than uh running script and downloading some data then we'll use task Runner [Music] so we'll now decide Uh define the definition of those two uh functions um this function and then the actual function definition so this function uh calling we have done in one of the session on 31st January uh we had a long session so that's why I won't explain each and every steps so I will",
  "I won't explain each and every steps so I will just give the definition of this particular function what it supposed to do so it will install a package and it need to run a script from a URL with provided arguments and the parameters that it that function takes are it needs to be part of function itself and these are the properties name backage name so and the type of this particular parameter will be string and then we'll provide the description about it the name of the package to install",
  "about it the name of the package to install leave empty if and installation is not required and then the other okay we actually don't need the name of the package maybe we'll just keep the script URL and then type would be a string and description would be the URL of the script to run and this will contain the arguments for for uh so this is the python PR function that we actually want to execute uh now I will send a request to openi and um we need some task we have this data and then we need",
  "need some task we have this data and then we need to also mention the functions and then tools choice automatically pick one tool return response. Jason so now I will have to get the so now I I'm just exporting stop sharing the screen I know oh that is because I want to export the variable rate all right um so I will be running it from here in [Music] so now I have exported the variable so now I will execute the file um and UV from app. P oh what happened to app. Pi oh it a CD and cdds Chan and",
  "happened to app. Pi oh it a CD and cdds Chan and then project one and then subdirectory UV run du app. and let's go to this Docker file yeah we are able to read it now we need to send a post request that's why uh I will use vs code um HTTP iph iPhone 127 uh Local Host back slash 8,000 and then back slash it is run and then how it should be call in and then it is run and then task is equal to we'll provide the task till here give it anail and I will have to parameterize it st. m. ac.in even if I",
  "have to parameterize it st. m. ac.in even if I send this request now it won't get the request because module object is not callable let me send one more request okay it's still getting some error and module object is not callable earlier it was not saved so oh it should be request on post4 or min [Music] spining the neck yay so now it identifies this is the uh URL where request needs to go and these are the parameters H so so from this Json object we can actually get this function name and then",
  "we can actually get this function name and then arguments so it should be our choices and within choices it should be choices of zero call it a list and then it is m message what is it messages and from message we have tool calls and then from here we need function and let's return this oh server error and must be integer or not string list indices must be integers or slices not a string okay now we are getting these two parameters and the name of the function and then the arguments that needs",
  "of the function and then the arguments that needs to be passed through the function so I hope you can see that uh this particular llm that request that we sent GPT request that we sent when it receives the task is able to extract the URL um this function it needs to call because remember there's a task run and there's a script Runner function and it is able to identify that yes it needs to use the script Runner function and it also is able to get the arguments of the function so in this case it",
  "the arguments of the function so in this case it would be the email so once you're able to extract that out you pass those first of all you select the function to run so there will be a um block an if block that will you will run next and then you will tell it okay this is the URL that is one of the arguments you pass and you also pass to that function a second argument which is that email address that you require then we will run the script Runner function in order to fetch the file that is",
  "function in order to fetch the file that is required which is data gen in this case and it'll use UV to run that data gen. py which will then generate the files that are required to run the rest of the tasks any questions so far so I know that was a bit quick this section but we want to try and get you to A1 as quickly as possible question okay go ahead yeah so here it's script run right and we are def defining like scpt to be running from the URL so if you give a similar wordings and give an",
  "URL so if you give a similar wordings and give an prompt will it automatically pick this prompt yes so yeah yeah so so the whole purpose of um using this uh function call as it were script Runner is so that it's able to par out the package name that we want I mean not package name the pack the URL of the where the script is and to pass the arguments that go into those are the two things that are required from from task A1 right if you remember correctly task A1 has two two parts to it there's a",
  "task A1 has two two parts to it there's a script a location of a script and and a single parameter that passes to of course here we take more than one parameter we can take multiple parameters as well so it's a little more General the script but it's able the fact that it's able to get the script URL and the uh arguments that go to it that's what we need right then once we use that then the next thing is to use subprocess and run UV with that uh script location and the argument that you want to",
  "script location and the argument that you want to uh send to it so that's what jaaj will demonstrate next is it yeah fine can you show me that post request once yeah okay so uh so from uh this particular thing we need to get the arguments which have this particular script and then the argument we need to use uh we need to import Json because this is a string that we are returning and I will do Lords and then we'll get the arguments from it and within this argument we need a script URL but let's",
  "this argument we need a script URL but let's first sa arguments and then we need a script URL and then we also need uh email so email is the first argument so I will just use arguments of arents okay we uh have arguments then we need arguments of args of zero which have emailed and then we need to so now what I will be doing I will be importing subprocess module and using subprocess we will execute uh UV command so the command that we need to execute is UV and then run and after that uh we need",
  "is UV and then run and after that uh we need to provide the name of that particular script so this is script URL and then it will have email so this is what we need to run but we won't be ex able to execute it directly from this file so for that we'll need to import sub process and now we will run a command from sub process so this is command that we need to run and let's run this command and let's do it inside the container so I will uh rebuild the image pman these are the existing images that",
  "the image pman these are the existing images that we have and pman build hyph T task Runner we can call it and then uh we'll build it from the current working directory so after it have build I will run this particular image word run and then we we want to access a proxy environment variable inside Docker so we'll have to uh so this AI proxy right now is sitting within our machine so it doesn't have doer machine doesn't have access to AI proxy so this is how we can provide that exess and now I",
  "this is how we can provide that exess and now I will do Port mapping 8,000 to 8,000 and then we need to put the image ID it do start so now we have board mapping we can send the request internal server error and this error is from here just an object must be string by it or by not dictionary must be string white or white not a dictionary is it already a valid J let's remove [Applause] this and let's stop this particular container and let me rebuild I spe teachers El not spelling mistake here",
  "I spe teachers El not spelling mistake here got spelling mistake these are two different things you not see this sping the C and the interchanged okay now um so I need to get these commands but rather than building image every time what I will do I will just stop this particular Im so right now I'm just shutting down this machine so it should not be running now I will uh get inside that machine and then I will just update the script so it is exact and then I think I8 then the container ID so",
  "and then I think I8 then the container ID so this will list all the container IDs which were previously running so this was the latest one that we have created and now we want to use p man exact I it and container ID the container which I want to go to and then this should be bash okay maybe bin Bash I thought it will restart the container by itself but I will have to manually start it now after starting let's get inside that container we have this particular file and we want to I want to just",
  "particular file and we want to I want to just change content of this file but right now VI is not available so we can install VI editor so VI is just a kind of text editor which we can use so these are the four lines that I want to change and s c rpt s c i r PT okay let's save this file and exit out of this container and let me stop this machine uh so that we can restart it and server will get redeployed stop and then container ready so what J just quickly showed here is if you have a small",
  "J just quickly showed here is if you have a small error that you want to correct and you don't want to rebuild the image over again again you can run a small text editor inside your Docker image and so that's what he did here because if you remember Docker image is like a separate computer almost right so he installed Bim and then he just made the small so there's a spelling mistake in his code over there which is why he's getting the errors so instead of rebuilding it he has just corrected it",
  "instead of rebuilding it he has just corrected it inside the docker image itself okay hope you understood what he did just now let's restart the container and I think now we can send a request and it gets us some error but let's list down those errors okay I don't know why this is getting some error it is some indicis [Music] thing maybe we'll continue this session in the next session okay uh thanks gaj just it's just um what do you call for it some Json parsing right so that hopefully you guys",
  "Json parsing right so that hopefully you guys should be able to do easily I think because it's been a long session uh and we've been working all day as well so and then at the end of it we had a three-hour session so that's why we have um we have I think we have reached the limits of uh our ability to see spelling mistakes and things of that sort okay so we do apologize for that um but hopefully we've got you to the point where you can run have you uh have you shown UV Run for the um okay so",
  "you uh have you shown UV Run for the um okay so sub process okay yes Telvin go ahead yeah so I have seen that script I have a doubt so here we have like cling getting the image from the getting the image from the doer and running in the container right yeah yeah so actually the code we edited we edited in local and we did not push it to get itself right yeah that is true I mean ideally you should not do that okay in this particular situation what happened is we were just a little bit impatient",
  "happened is we were just a little bit impatient and wanted to get to the end of the session so that's why doing shortcuts and trying toct theod but yes right do all the debugging first and the end only page and then push it once you know it's okay because when I tried I create on acction class withf flow where will be pushing to the gate and automatically it will be building image itself yeah that is good that is a very good approach actually that's fantastic approach that's really good and",
  "that's fantastic approach that's really good and this script will be shared with us or this particular script won't be shared because um this has generally been our practice where we don't share what we do um but uh I hope that you have gained all the knowledge that you need from it and plus the video will be available so you can then write out the script yourself you can skip ahead and get the bits that you want right so you can then reconstruct something that's suitable for your yeah F yes",
  "something that's suitable for your yeah F yes sang sang go ahead hello sir uh hi sorry I was not able to unmute myself uh sir could you please guide on the B tasks the B group tasks for okay yeah so beat asks you have a specific question maybe we can talk about it but but if it is to solve it then we will have a session on how we can approach those tasks as yeah yeah the specific question that I have sir is that uh you know you've mentioned like you know compress uh the image or you know",
  "like you know compress uh the image or you know transcribe MP3 file so those files will also come as part of data J or how will those be provided uh to the script and how should output be shared yeah so what will happen is data gen will will create some files okay the current data gen is not going to be the final version of the data gen okay so you shouldn't expect the same same things to be evaluated or the same files to be created and things that but um in B tasks what will happen is a clear",
  "but um in B tasks what will happen is a clear prompt will be given the prompt will be similar to these kinds of prompts where there will be a path name and there'll be a file name all these things will be there it'll be a clear prompt actually because we have uh uh discuss this with Anand about what students can expect so that some little more clarity is available so he said the prompt will be very clear it will specify the file name or that has to be worked on and what the task it has to do",
  "to be worked on and what the task it has to do with that file name those two things will be very clear okay okay sir so it's not like we would have to let's say some base 64 you know as a response to the function or something for I mean so yeah so over here um compressing and resizing images um I I suspect that the task will say here is this so this is an example of what could be a task right so right they get this image from this uh file and uh you know it could be any number of pillow",
  "and uh you know it could be any number of pillow operations right so I don't know what kinds of pillow operations are available but he has mentioned here um that U compress oriz yeah yeah so these are possible two things that it might need to do um is he going to give more than that I'm not certain I mean the only thing I can say is that over here if you look over here it says but they have not defined it more precisely than this so I would take it as this being possibly the the limit of what",
  "it as this being possibly the the limit of what is required but you could also make it broader so we when we um show you um a more advanced way of coding possibly your program might be able to deal with u something that goes beyond compressing and resear possibly uh so yeah but at the end of the day I suppose if you can compress or resize an image then um you know that might be sufficient for Visa I say might because I myself have not seen the final version of evaluate uh py which brings me to",
  "version of evaluate uh py which brings me to another point I wanted to make very clear so I'll just go to this discourse thre this is quite an important thing actually so if you all go here you see this um at the top of discourse there is a link here right this is U actually quite valuable if you go here you can see that there are three files there's a read me which is this file but then there's the data gen py so evaluate Pi gets this data genp and you can actually inspect this file okay and",
  "and you can actually inspect this file okay and this will give you some help or Clues as to how you might construct functions now again if you rigidly code your functions to do this then more than likely half your functions will fail because it may not necessarily want you to do precisely this right you understand my point yes sir yeah but it will give you what it will give you some help in understanding okay H this is the kind of function I need to build okay yeah the thing is sir we at least",
  "to build okay yeah the thing is sir we at least this is very good because we at least have one use case to run against and perfect you know all the errors and then we can make it more General yes exactly so you can that's what you can use this code for you can use this code to get a sense of first of all what kind of tasks it will send okay so if you scroll okay so this is the data gen file this is the file that is being generated so this is one aspect of it but if you look at back at here",
  "one aspect of it but if you look at back at here there's an evaluate this is a more important file okay the evaluate. py file um will um have these um tasks so you can see these are the kind of prompts that it will send okay uh here's another example of prompts it will send so these kind of prompts it will send and it will then uh run a um U run the task uh send the task to your run URL and then send one to your read URL and then it'll compare the outputs between the two okay okay so these two",
  "outputs between the two okay okay so these two files will help you construct your project uh but do not use this to hard code again you hard code exactly the way it's made you more than likely more than half your project will okay understood sir sir just one more question sir specific one is this uh for text trans transcribing yeah uh we should embed the model within this container itself is it this faster visper or something else or I just could you say that again I didn't quite understand the",
  "you say that again I didn't quite understand the question uh there is a task for transcribing an MP3 file uh I think it's uh ah this yeah so the way I would approach that that is you will get a obviously you will get a file um and then you will have to write a code that can run the transcription against that file but it will need a model offline model um no no it doesn't have to be an offline model I'll okay I'll tell you what tomorrow we are having a meeting with Anam I'll clarify that does it",
  "a meeting with Anam I'll clarify that does it can it run using an offline model or do we use uh open AI itself okay I'll just clarify that so I'll just make a note of that um okay one second just [Music] uh this on here just give me one second [Music] it [Music] was V8 okay right okay uh okay any other questions before we wind up yeah I know there are couple of more raised hands so I don't want to take time but yeah I just want to for this making a commit to the git repo we need some G",
  "making a commit to the git repo we need some G credentials also right then will those also be provided in the [Music] prompt there will be public repos it will access so you will not need credentials okay so then uh the code is should essentially clone it and then make a commit but not necessarily sync it or um so when it clones it U it will just get the you will run some commands on your CLI right that's effectively what will happen and um the then once those uh commands are run on the CLI",
  "then once those uh commands are run on the CLI then committing also is made on the CLI right so you will not need uh I don't think you will need any credentials for a public repo I don't not entirely sure do you need public for public repo do we need credentials to make commitments no right you do the local commit will happen but like for the code to be like you know again then mered with okay yeah yeah I understood I understood so this is G repo right it says git repo so that that means not",
  "right it says git repo so that that means not GitHub right GitHub okay got it sir it will be local only yeah yes yes got it sir thank you so much and yeah I'll wait for the session on bask sir when when do you think you we going to have sir um we still have to we have some work that needs to be done before we get that ready I would say possibly most possibly tomorrow okay but I not 100% sure but if not tomorrow 100% it will be there will be a Thursday session okay okay sir okay thank you so",
  "Thursday session okay okay sir okay thank you so much sir okay yes next who who's next sang is it uh it was me sir sang all right sorry okay sir sir is it one yes sir yeah uh thank you uh sir just know uh J said that he will be continuing the session in the next term sir please let it happen sir why because some of us are directly from data sence stream kind of thing we are not so much TI in in this regard so even though if it is explanation of 10 minutes that is okay for us yeah this we will",
  "10 minutes that is okay for us yeah this we will continue the session we are not going to I mean not today obviously but we will continue next session we will be continuing to develop this skeleton project that we are doing showing you yes sir thank you that's a thank you yeah okay yeah sir I was next in line project yes sir sir the project criteria says You must complete all these three steps get so sir we have to be able to finish all A1 to A10 to get the complete score or if some of them are",
  "to get the complete score or if some of them are not working in between uh you know I just wanted to be uh I just want to understand the criteria there sir uh where did what um what are you referring to I'm not sure what you're referring to I'm referring to the the project one me just paste this link in the the chat uh I mean this is Project one right you can see the screen right uh sir he's talking about the portal portal the portal portal let me okay just give me a second I'll pull up Port uh",
  "okay just give me a second I'll pull up Port uh okay [Music] so yeah you must complete all these three steps so there are three steps here right oh these three oh sorry sir I confused this with so sorry apolog yeah so you must complete all these three steps to get a score okay which is fill the form complete the deliverables and complete the prerequisites yeah so if you look at what the deliverables are these are all the deliverables you must complete all the deliverables we didn't say complete",
  "all the deliverables we didn't say complete all the tasks but these you must all of these must be done which is create the repo add the license this is why we started from the very first itself if you were at the beginning of the session then we showed you how to uh create these end points post and get end points we showed you how to push code we showed you how to build the talker application we showed you how to publish it and publicly to dockerhub then we showed you how to so pulling is not",
  "then we showed you how to so pulling is not necessary that was just a little bit extra but publishing it is very important uh being able to make sure that this runs using this token and this uh construction by the way there's an error here in this uh in this um um what do you call for it in this command you see this dollar image name right uh that is that should not be there if you put it here it will not run it's an error so instead of putting it here I don't know if you can see my marker can",
  "it here I don't know if you can see my marker can you see my marker yes yes yes sir can so this is wrong okay this instead should come at the end over here okay this image name has to come at the end okay yes okay um we will correct this I've sent a correction request already so hopefully it will be corrected by tomorrow and then um the next thing is uh yeah so this is another deliverable right so these apis should be running and this is a deliverable you must submit the Google form right this",
  "you must submit the Google form right this form essential if you don't do these you will get zero all deliverables have to be provided okay okay second secondly these notes are also essential as part of the deliverables using AI proxy token in the environment from the environment okay obtaining it and sticking to GPT 40 mini that's the only thing you should use okay and um uh this is something else that is important okay many of you must have skipped past this so I'm telling you now so since",
  "skipped past this so I'm telling you now so since you're in this session you have gained the value of it your each call to any of this every task that a call is sent to must complete within 20 seconds if it does not complete within 20 seconds if you're doing some very fancy code in the background that's taking 30 seconds or 40 seconds then you know you'll not get a mark for that task and uh complete all these three steps complete what complete all prerequisites in evaluation so we don't say",
  "all prerequisites in evaluation so we don't say complete all of evaluation but these prerequisites are required okay prerequisites see your repository must meet the following criteria to be eligible repository exists publicly accessible so if it is private make it public iTab repository has a license with MIT iTab repository has a valid Docker file this Docker file must be in your repository so you remember J show you when constructing the Pod man that he showed you there is a Docker file that",
  "that he showed you there is a Docker file that you have to use to construct the uh uh to construct the uh Docker image right so that Docker file must be in the GitHub repository okay if it's not there guess what you'll not be eligible for evaluation Docker image must be publicly assessible Docker image should run using this command and um Docker image uses the same Docker file as in your GitHub reposit okay these two thank you sir sir just one request to the team would be would it be consider",
  "request to the team would be would it be consider postponing the date ofine by sometimes for project yes I don't think it will happen for two reasons one project was released a month ago and uh two um we will be moving the deadline of ga5 anyway so uh so that you can focus on Project one so that's why I don't think it's going to happen I will we will discuss it in tomorrow's meeting but I would not have high hopes for that than you if I if I was a betting if I was a betting man and I'm not then",
  "a betting if I was a betting man and I'm not then I would not bet on it being moved okay okay sir please several such requests kindly consider we will discuss it I can promise you we'll discuss it but I cannot promise you it will be more okay okay thank you sir thank you sir that's the minimum that's the best I can do right which is sure sir raising in the meeting okay thank you sir sir please at least request this evaluate uh script which can be a sample script for tasks B also um no I when I",
  "a sample script for tasks B also um no I when I last spoke to Anand he's not going to do that I don't think he's going to provide an evaluate for B but again I can always discuss it I can ask the question sir but whether it will come or not I wouldn't bet on it because I understand if he creates see valid p is a very good file actually because it gives you a real sense of what expect right yes so he's kind of showing his hand if he if he does it for B tasks right anyway but I don't know maybe",
  "for B tasks right anyway but I don't know maybe he will be kind and decide okay you know it's yeah so if you could put a request on that I'll ask the question okay yes yes telin yeah so regarding the task we right we have B3 to B10 and in on meeting could you ask like Clarity on what is the input what is the parameters and what is the output will it be stored in file or something uh so the inputs will be given in the as part of the request itself what the inputs are I'm asking whether it's URL",
  "what the inputs are I'm asking whether it's URL or it's an file name it might be anything right it could be a file name it could be a URL we don't know uh it your your code should be able to handle the location whatever the location is so it's better to think of it as a location the location could be a local file the location could be a okay and but I can ask the question just for clarification I don't know if you'll give Clarity on it but uh my understanding so as far as We Know is that it",
  "my understanding so as far as We Know is that it could be so this is for tasks P3 so yeah because every task it's looks like we can have both the cases yeah yeah yeah of course because I mean particularly if you think of audio files and things like that you know it might be local right rather than fetching audio file from something so that's possible but then equally possible is uh you know getting for example cloning a GitHub repo is definitely going to be a URL right yeah so yeah or maybe",
  "going to be a URL right yeah so yeah or maybe it's not a URL maybe it's a local git repo from somewhere else I don't know but point is you should think of it as a location it might be a URL or it might be something local yeah so I am expecting some brief description on this one like all the task B3 to B1 okay because we are unable to understand like f data from a it's just rest AP so what should we return if it's a should we save it out or what so even uh so even so that I can give you Clarity",
  "so even uh so even so that I can give you Clarity on the output will also be mentioned in the task because if you look at uh task a right you can see clearly the structure there's an input file and there's an output file right but that's part of the prompt itself The Prompt itself will be like this yeah yeah see in prompt it's showing input file output file but the process is in the description right yeah according to we have to write right so in here same thing will happen a prompt uh uh there",
  "here same thing will happen a prompt uh uh there will be an input and an output file defined for sure yeah that I mean that is other you cannot run the task right you can't me the task we can't measure the task yeah that's fine but the parameter we are getting out is that is it a Jon parameter or should we have an output that's not different you oh you mean in in in I know what you're talking about you're talking about this right yeah like this if you want to have an AP call the return type",
  "if you want to have an AP call the return type should be a Json or should be a response yeah have it will have to be this right even if it's a b task same thing applies for B task in B3 task if you see there it's giving F data from the AP sure yeah and save it right compl so if it completes the task successfully you have to return a HTTP 200 okay response yeah that I'm asking that AP end point is same as our run end point just consider the I didn't understand your question AP is 8,000 and we",
  "understand your question AP is 8,000 and we are we are calling this this PO post right yeah yeah this itself can be given as an AP input [Music] right uh the API input will be what see the input will come here in task okay yeah I mean that's what jaraj was showing you right yeah he basically took this whole thing yeah that's fine that's prompt that's prompt yeah he took whole and he that has been taken and it will be giving a response of 200 or some response these these These are the responses",
  "some response these these These are the responses that are expected yeah so like this response should be there for like B3 task also yeah yeah yeah these are Universal a or no this is running right running the task you are I'm telling in the task itself they are given F data from the task in B3 if you see fet data from an API yeah fetch data from an API so what will happen is the task will say petch data from and for an example I could I mean I don't know I'm just giving a example okay like",
  "I don't know I'm just giving a example okay like Pokemon API or something right so it'll so it'll say so the task will be fetch data from this API okay okay that's what the task might say so return type would be the or the response I'm asking uh the return type so the return type is uh so it says fetch data but the data is being fetched and being saved right yeah is it response or Jon data that's not what whatever you get from the API what it does an API normally give you API will give you Json",
  "an API normally give you API will give you Json right yeah no no response we have right basic response we have inser the response you have the data I think he is asking response status or content yeah that's what content or full response itself that's not the it Clarity is not ah okay in that sense uh um that might uh depend on the prompt itself that's given I don't know what he will want to fetch from the AP because the here everything is broader and we can think anyway so true true but that's",
  "and we can think anyway so true true but that's see that's why I said you can't hardcode these functions if your functions are very hardcoded right it will fail these tasks because that's why they are vague so it could be fetch data from an API but it might be so to be so the response so the fetch command might say fetch uh fetch this key okay from this API it could be that right yeah that's what that's what I want the parameter yeah so we don't know right what the parameters no if you could",
  "know right what the parameters no if you could ask that Clarity on what because each and every task we can imagine any some should be the right but you're asking specifically for B3 right no each and every task needs like same for clone repo like we can clone it yeah we can commit it in local and we can push it also that's what the actual commit is yeah so get the clarity out so this is straightforward right this doesn't no if you want to push it to GitHub again we have to have a password and",
  "it to GitHub again we have to have a password and usern no no it won't it won't be this won't be GitHub this will be to git only get repo and make a commit I'll check though but I'm pretty sure it won't see you need credentials right you need cred that's so and I doubt he will put credentials in the uh in the task itself I doubt he will submit a credentials while running the task it will be having a prompt where it will ask the credential then we will enter then it will be commit that's what",
  "we will enter then it will be commit that's what the intermediate step is yeah but I don't think he will make it that complex that would be very cruel and unusual yeah and for the B task it's telling run and escalate query yeah and that's escalate du TB so TG DB is an optional or what yeah you what he's trying what he's trying to say is you don't know what database it's going to be but you'll have to run a query on some database yeah run a query means it will be given a prompt to be a query",
  "means it will be given a prompt to be a query itself right yeah I mean again it's not specific right so it could say run an SQL query on either of these databases so I don't know the prompt will be a precise SQL query or it or it will be a text that says find me all the gold tickets that were sold yeah that's what that's what and then and then it will have to construct a query to fetch that information from from a database right that would be the workflow so I don't know what it could be yeah",
  "workflow so I don't know what it could be yeah so that one and scrap data from the website is should we have an tag name based scrapping or should have an saved it into CSV like that all that will be provided by The Prompt it won't be specified here okay what you do with the what you are supposed to do the prompt will be detailed okay right okay see I understand why you're asking this questions because to a certain extent you feel you can create a function that will be able to solve the problem",
  "a function that will be able to solve the problem right and I'm saying maybe there is a better way maybe you get llm to write you the code from a prompt yeah right yeah yeah understood then you don't have to worry about it right yeah yeah okay okay next and B8 task MP3 file is there right cannot we try it like online models and try to transcribe it um I'm see what he has given is he said only to use 40 mini so I have to SP no still because not audible hello hello am I audible yeah hell okay",
  "audible hello hello am I audible yeah hell okay yeah B task like we have isper model so we have different models right so here I'll CL yeah on that one okay and the last one bet task they filter the CSV and so filter column name and value will be single values or multiple we will have we don't know okay that is also that okay and last question is like API token got little bit expired so oh uh API token is expired okay yeah that's one of the things on our agenda to discuss anyway yeah okay yeah",
  "on our agenda to discuss anyway yeah okay yeah so if you could postpone a little bit for deadline then it will be for me okay sorry who is this telin okay okay I think I saw your post on this yeah I have stuck four last three to four years okay okay well uh that's something we need to discuss as a team so I can't uh I don't know them my gut feeling is that you will get some extra maybe okay but we will uh yeah at least I need just a week because I cannot proceed right h no when I say extra I'm",
  "I cannot proceed right h no when I say extra I'm not talking about time I'm talking about uh maybe you'll get some extra tokens I don't know okay okay no even if I take get the token on the last minute I cannot do right ah yeah yeah last minute no but if we are going to do it we will you will know by tomorrow for sure because tomorrow morning we have the meeting yeah okay okay so if it is decided that there is a mechanism to extend credit to you or some specific students or a whole bunch of",
  "you or some specific students or a whole bunch of students whatever it is the decision will be made tomorrow morning and it will be immediately available whatever the because it's very trivial for us to increase the budget in the sense from a operational point of view from a decision point of view it's a very different thing because if we say for example if we increase the everyone's limit by $1 that's roughly 1.38 lakhs we have to suddenly ask operations hey can you spend 1.3 lakhs on TVs",
  "ask operations hey can you spend 1.3 lakhs on TVs students you know they will turn around and say get on your bike you know so but I'm not saying that they won't do it but obviously someone has to authorize it and that can take a little teeny bit more time okay yeah and uh and uh for tracking purpose you as right for tracking of the amount of C yeah you asked about the costing right for each prompt M so do like larger prompts and stronger prompting cost more yes because prompts um definitely",
  "cost more yes because prompts um definitely the amount of tokens you use is what it's based on so the the more larger The Prompt is the more it cost but to give you an idea right so so far we have done we've constructed um I would say 34 of project okay so far project one and we have used up what 20p we have used up 23p so we have used up less than 1/8 of the uh total allowance that you guys have okay so it is possible my suggestion is do all the testing in like some Jupiter file or some",
  "all the testing in like some Jupiter file or some something to test whether your functions work whether the expected outcome is what you expected to see then you compile it all together in a proper python file and then push it okay so you can test things like that right yeah we can test it but still we have to get the prompts yeah but if you run the evaluate. py file it will test all 10 in one go right yeah but that will be very wasteful so that's so even for initiating that I need token right",
  "so even for initiating that I need token right yeah yeah so yeah anyway we will discuss that tomorrow and we will see what can done okay I expect you will get some more allowance but the amount uh is to be decided yeah and get us a mail on that okay yeah definitely we'll send a mail those sort of things we send a ma okay yeah thanks for the yeah sure yes next Mah uh related to task a so once we get the arguments right whatever is shown in the so once we get the arguments then we will get the",
  "so once we get the arguments then we will get the input file and as well as we will know the in which file we have to write so again we have to call llm to execute that prompt against that uh data or we should write some function and based on that see there are different approaches to this okay there is a you can either have llm to create code for you uh or you can write functions that are generic and are able to be parameterized so in the next session we'll show you a parameterized version and",
  "we'll show you a parameterized version and in fact you've seen one of it today actually A1 is a parameterized function the parameter is the what the location is and the argument so in a similar way you can construct some of the a tasks I won't say all of the a tasks but some of the a tasks you can parameterize and construct them but if you do all of them that way then it becomes a bit too rigid so if there is some difference in what's expected like from the then you might fail a couple of tasks",
  "from the then you might fail a couple of tasks see the way he's going to valate he's told us is maybe a third of them will be e easy okay so maybe three or four of them you will be able to get away with some hard Cod and stuff then there will be some medium prompts these will require parameterization you know so it has to be a little more flexible so maybe you will get uh another three more points then some hard prompts he will give so these will need to be really uh what do you call for it",
  "will need to be really uh what do you call for it clever code okay but what is clever code clever code is getting your llm to create the code and generate it for you right so but for example like dates right or sorting one if I say sort based on first name and then last name yeah so this can change based on the prompt yeah of course it can change because it's an array of contacts right so it could be S by phone number or it could be S by so when when I pass this to LM llm to generate a code",
  "when I pass this to LM llm to generate a code right it will give me based on the prompt itself it will not give me uh so you are saying that in first place whenever we are getting arguments we should ask for code itself and execute that code that's probably uh that is probably the most um useful way right because that's what an assistant does right an assistant is flexible able to do anything you ask them to do okay got it so but that requires a higher level of uh logic uh in the way you",
  "a higher level of uh logic uh in the way you construct so we will demonstrate how to write self correcting code okay okay okay uh because I was trying to write functions and most I think that every task I have written a different function okay so is that the right approach or there could be different approach taken it may work for some of some or maybe half the tasks it's possible to work that way but by no means but if I write T function for each task right the function list itself will be H",
  "task right the function list itself will be H so it will be considered as a token right so it will be yeah yeah yeah of course so that is the reason I'm just checking is what is the approach to yeah yeah this is the tradeoff so the tradeoff is you can Define all the functions then the function calling is huge how you can or you can have llm generate the code okay got got your point thank you but uh just llm generating the code also requires some very careful prompt engineering so you get some",
  "very careful prompt engineering so you get some very precise output from it and you need a error correcting Loop so you need uh the code the error it generates then if the error then you run the code if it produces an error you take the code the error and the context and then rerun it through the Alm and then you have some limit say three times or five times or whatever it is and so it will keep correcting itself until gets the answer right that's one possibility got your point thank you okay",
  "one possibility got your point thank you okay next please Ashish yeah uh hello am I audable sir sure sure yeah sir so what I wanted to ask was uh is data genpi the link can we hardcode it can you hardcode it yes sir you can hardcode it but uh when the evaluation is done right you will not get the same data gen file anyway this is only for your uh uh for helping you so if I go back to is it if I this one see you can hard code this okay data to test in order to test your U test your uh project",
  "test in order to test your U test your uh project you can hardcode this as in what we that's what we did we downloaded data gen instead of fetching it all the time and all that sort of thing we downloaded the data gen file we run the data gen file and then we just test against the um files it generate but if you hardcode this into your Docker image right I can 100% guarantee you will not pass the project why because the files that will be generated won't be what data gen is currently doing",
  "won't be what data gen is currently doing it'll be a completely different data gen you see yes sir no sir I'm not saying the data gen file itself sir uh I'm just saying of the link can we hardcode the link will the link be same for the DAT for data gen no there is no guarantee of it being the same so we'll have to get the link as the first input or the first prompt yeah I mean that's what J showed in his session right he got it as a parameter he didn't hard code it right okay sir understood sir",
  "didn't hard code it right okay sir understood sir uh that's why this session was very important so you understand how to get out parameters out of a prompt if you can get parameters out of a prompt that's wonderful right yes sir okay uh yes Andrew uh good evening sir I just have like I want to discuss I have like three or four points can I just go through them quickly uh yeah sure Andrew are you the one who's posted your code on discourse yeah yes sir uh it's pretty good man it's I was very",
  "yes sir uh it's pretty good man it's I was very impressed yes I have that that also but first this self correcting code you discuss no sir uh I tried with crew Ai and autogen like the code interpretors but the problem is the model like it didn't recognize the UV package or the package like I think it was like little bit older model because I think UV was quite recent like correct so I that that I ran into an issue I hardcoded it still it kept giving UV con and interpreting it but sometimes",
  "giving UV con and interpreting it but sometimes maybe two out of four times it gave the right code but that was one issue I had so and the other one is today's session no sir I just wanted to know the code uh link or the like where I could just access because I I wasn't able to attend the session I might be able to attend the session so I just wanted to know if I could just get the yeah so we will not be providing the code brother I'm sorry about that uh but uh we will be uploading the session",
  "that uh but uh we will be uploading the session itself okay that's no problem then in that TDS in in this uh screen you're sharing it has the live sessions right this option yeah yeah yeah yeah so we so that will come come out tomorrow okay and the other one the extra credits no sir uh those who haven't use their credits with They al because I use the local llms to test sure sure yeah yeah that's fine because but at the end when I I just wanted to make sure after everything was working then I",
  "to make sure after everything was working then I would use the AI That's brilliant that's brilliant approach use local LM and check everything is working first yeah yes so I just want to know whether we' get extra credits for that um that's up to Anand no no like if everyone's getting I I don't want if everyone's getting a dollar dollar is I think too much maybe 50 cents to 2550 cents little bit extra just little bit for testing like one yeah yeah yeah so so see that's what tomorrow's morning",
  "yeah so so see that's what tomorrow's morning so some students have run out of credits so tomorrow's morning session we'll discuss how much and all those things we'll be discussed and the other one I just you said we couldn't hardcode the functions but that that was I think week three that was the main topic right function calling with schemas I just wanted to just just just show you some code just to see whether if that is somewhat general or even more General than that can I just share my",
  "even more General than that can I just share my screen okay uh Andrew what see this is not going to be the only session we started this session at 5 it's been going on for 4 hours so we really need to stop here okay I hope you appreciate that right okay yes yes sir okay I I'll just join toor I just wanted to discuss so I just want to get last point that uh so how I just how do we basically go about it I gener I like okay just if you could just go to task one or two or three or task n a n or a",
  "go to task one or two or three or task n a n or a 10 in your screen uh yeah yeah yeah see the 10th one right A10 Could It generally be just query a database um the most General one the so we can get arguments as the database file the name tickets and the type I mean column names and everything could be arguments but the main thing is just query a database would that be General enough is what I yeah I I yeah I mean it sounds fine to me yeah no because I I I'm not clearly sure exactly how General",
  "I I I'm not clearly sure exactly how General it is because if I tried a code interpreter it doesn't generate the code and I rerun it four five times not hallucinates it it it goes back to the same thing and gives the same output again and again and again the context even use the error code message so I just want to know how General it should be so A1 could be just I don't know query a database A8 could be get text from an image right okay I just want to know yeah so I'll see what Andrew I",
  "just want to know yeah so I'll see what Andrew I really have to make a hard stop okay we are really exhausted here okay so uh we'll take up these questions next session but uh put on discourse if you can okay you just joined right we've been going at it for four hours yeah yeah so uh just put on discourse these questions tomorrow morning before our meeting I'll have a look at the discourse post and meeting tomorrow what time the morning sir our meeting is at 9:30 so if you post morning yeah",
  "meeting is at 9:30 so if you post morning yeah okay so what you do is make a detailed uh deta report like I'll go through everything again now today ask your questions in detail and then yeah tag Anand on it and uh we'll uh we'll discuss that in tomorrow's meeting yes sir thank you okay thank you everybody uh thanks I hope this session was useful for all of you and um thanks for being with us Whoever has stuck with us from from uh from the beginning of the session okay thanks thanks good night",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/NMnwKp5tR-w =====",
  "we will look at who published the code first okay so GitHub enables us to check when commits were made and things of that sort so Anan said he will um Pro have us have an analysis script looking at all the submissions and whoever publishes a particular piece of code first obviously that's the original creator of the code right so that's the person who will get the diversity marks anyone else who copies it won't get it so that's how it and then uh with regards to the other bit which is",
  "then uh with regards to the other bit which is additional tasks that just means how clever is your program right can your program carry out a task that has not been described here at all so that's that's what it means okay so the recording is started sir just one thing uh actually I've tried the code which you uh which you guys discussed in the session before yesterday yeah uh but uh I'm getting the same issue where that JV sir was having uh session in the in that session that in the you're",
  "session in the in that session that in the you're muted saki you're not audible but anyway regarding Tuesday session actually uh uh I'm sending the post request uh but it is it's showing me some error it is giving me error message invalid schema for function script Runner I uh I have sent uh an email to JRA sir also he said that I should uh write message in messages in place of message I've done that also and it it is still showing me the same error okay can I share my screen so today we'll",
  "error okay can I share my screen so today we'll take the doubts at the end of the session uh because we still want to get through some of the things uh that we have planned for today as you can see the agenda on the screen uh we really need to get through this agenda first so that uh even others who need to do the project can get them done there is a slight correction from the first session that we did uh something that uh we forgot to mention so that might solve your problem so wait till this",
  "that might solve your problem so wait till this session is completed and then uh you know we can we'll take doubts at the end of the session is that okay okay sir thank you sir all right thanks you guys can uh Carry On Now Okay so let me open the code editor [Laughter] jaaj just make your screen slightly bigger so that the text is a bit clear okay is it okay now yeah that's good no just give me one minute okay so in the meanwhile to demonstrate let me lay down the agenda for today's session",
  "let me lay down the agenda for today's session first we going to discuss something Dock dock F and after that we'll be demonstrating how you can do function call we'll be demonstrating functions this from this and after that we will be showing you something yeah uh I'm audible guys yes sir clearly my was breaking it was breaking but now it is clear what I said the mean is preparing going to do in today's session it's still breaking uh let me uh is it fine now yes sir and yes there is some yes",
  "is it fine now yes sir and yes there is some yes it seems fine yeah so there is some no in the background because there are other T in the room as well who are taking their live session so you might you guys might face some background noises but you can just completely that okay so uh if my voice is clear now I will lay down the agenda for today's session firstly we are going to show you guys how there was something Docker image Docker file I'm sorry and after that we'll be demonstrating how",
  "sorry and after that we'll be demonstrating how how you can do function calling in the project uh I'll be demonstrating two or three functions from the phase a of the project all right to just give you guys an overview of how you can get started with it okay after that we'll be showing you a self correcting Loop so this is a surprise for you guys and the biggest surprise of this entire live session would be the efficient PR one okay and after that they will be giving we will be solving your",
  "that they will be giving we will be solving your doubts so uh you know if you guys want to see those surprises and uh just clear clarify doubts so remain with us till the okay so jaaj you can so uh how many of you have tried installing uh like when reading data using UV data gen file that is there um basically task even and failed in that because of some permission issue did anyone face that sir I did but uh at first I faced the issue but then uh I just chat GED it and then it was solved okay",
  "uh I just chat GED it and then it was solved okay sir I have also faced it but I am not able to resolve that it is still uh asking me to install UV con and uh still asking me to uh install fast API and all uh okay okay sir I getting an error regarding the AI proxy token okay okay we we'll talk about uh those errors later okay at the ending of this session we'll take the doubts uh so sir actually what I did now uh for that issue I just uh used uh run command and pip install in this Docker file",
  "run command and pip install in this Docker file itself uh what did you pip install sir uh the things which were missing like uor and these type of things so I use run command here in the docker file itself and pip install uor like that and it was working uh I'm talking about so this is the data gen script right uh when me go over here and then if I just copy this path and let me open my terminal first okay BH and now the way to uh so basically the way to download this data set is let's create a",
  "way to download this data set is let's create a folder let's call it dumore project or something and let's get in that folder uh now let I want to install or if you want to just download the data set so we'll execute this file and we need to also have some so we also need to pass our email so that it generates data for us uh study. ac.in ds. study. ac.in yeah this is correct um J do we need to put down our student ID for authentic uh so basically it is not authenticating this data gen file what",
  "it is not authenticating this data gen file what it is doing it is taking your email address as seed and then it will generate data on based of that email address for this yeah yes yes yes no no like when you're trying to download it it might get you this error it might not happen and sometimes it can happen because of some permission issues right no I have used the ID should contain iitm also when you type uh no that is I mean okay okay sir I thought it was for authentication so it should be",
  "thought it was for authentication so it should be correct that's why I'm saying no no no no no it can be any email address even it can be some something so B basically it will generate some random data using this as seed so every time you pass this email address file generating the data it will generate the same data set okay this is purpose of but the thing that you have to keep in mind is that when we will be evaluating your script that would be done using email addresses so you should keep",
  "be done using email addresses so you should keep that in mind and uh I would suggest you that so what ja is saying is that you can use any email address and that will create a special unique data for you okay but what we are going to do on our end is that we will be taking your email IDs and then we will be using that data which was given to you which should be which should have been generated using your ID for the validation part so if let's say you are using your personal IDs for data",
  "say you are using your personal IDs for data generation part that won't help you so you might be able to solve everything and your app must be working perfectly fine but what we will be doing is that we will be using your email ID for the data okay so it would be better just use your email add okay yeah so basically it might be some other email address as well so for example if I just go to Project fun page uh TS uh so over here in task A1 we need to hit this particular end point right it it",
  "need to hit this particular end point right it it can even change it should it can change and then this is the user email address so this email address it can be some other email address as well so don't try to hard code okay uh Shan will show in next function calling how you can parameterize it okay so basically sometimes you might get this permission denied error so in that case uh within your Docker file you just put run mkd and then minus p and then data so this will create a data folder",
  "p and then data so this will create a data folder with appropriate permissions for um fetching the data then it won't get you any error so this this should be the part part of this file and the other thing that can be done is you just put root I mean I want prefer to do it this way okay because it it it may change so if you if you put this particular Dot and then backstr data it will create a data folder over here but uh in general it will try to create a data folder in the root directory",
  "try to create a data folder in the root directory itself so it should have a pro proper permissions so this is how you can add permissions to the data folder okay uh Shan you can go ahead with the function calling all right so the name of the folder would be data only right it would not change uh yes so I have I have created a custom folder but you should not do this okay no not here the earlier example that you gave in the docker file okay yeah now here we have data now in the prompt we are",
  "now here we have data now in the prompt we are going to get data only right the question that we are going to get yeah that is correct okay thank you I stop presenting all right guys is my screen visible yes sir and is my voice clear can you speak again please yes sir okay so let's just make your screen a little bit bigger maybe one sure sure sure sure is this fine yeah looks good looks uh can you change the background as well if possible this background yeah all right that why because like um",
  "yeah all right that why because like um I tried to look too hard and like it started to give me headache uh the thing is that uh usually while programming I prefer a dark te that's why I keep this thing but no that's okay that's okay like due to age also might be like part from my end but I started to get headaches while I was looking at so do you want it to a light theme or light lighter theme lighter theme and little bit bigger because I think you are recording on your uh desktop screen only",
  "you are recording on your uh desktop screen only mhm not on the extended monitor so yeah yeah so because of that only the fonts are a little bit small yeah is this good yeah yeah a little bit good yeah okay cuz I guess I don't have any light uh light H yeah to much light yeah I think yeah this one is good a little bit bigger little bit bigger just something like okay this is better San if you wanted to go through them you can just you don't have to click them you can just sort of use the cursor",
  "to click them you can just sort of use the cursor and go through them it'll change on the flight can you please repeat so the themes right when you're looking at themes you don't have to click on them specifically to um change them you can sort of just yeah do that and it will change it okay okay but the thing is that that would hide the code as well so okay this is what I guess this is good all right so let's get started and uh so first and foremost we will be creating a basic uh CL API okay",
  "we will be creating a basic uh CL API okay so for that okay all right one thing you might have noticed that I have created this API key this API uh key which I'm using in an environment variable so this is preferred and uh this is recommended uh because obviously if I share my apq over here that would be you guys can just copy it and use my $2 so that I I won I won't want that yeah this is where we are incorporating course in our application okay and uh okay that's enough all right so I will",
  "and uh okay that's enough all right so I will just copy and paste those little questions that okay so this is the end point okay and uh uh uh uh okay I have to place this as well so basically the entire function of the entire concept behind function calling is that uh it's nothing so the name of function calling it sounds like Okay so this might be something very Hightech and you know very complex to understand but the thing is that it's really simple okay the entire concept of function calling",
  "okay the entire concept of function calling is that you are providing your llm you providing chat GPT with that you are telling it that okay I have these these many number of functions ready with me and what I'm going to do is that uh I want you I will just pass a text message all right so if I just head back to my post man this is my post man okay so can you guys see this that data tasks over here I can magnify this as well okay it won't be magnified okay so this end point will take an",
  "be magnified okay so this end point will take an argument of task okay a parameter of task and over here I can write any English Gat I want okay so this is generate all the data this okay so the llm would interpret this entire text and then it would extract out the parameters which are needed for your function okay so it will just or let's say if I create a function where I am let's say I'm calling out I'm just I want to generate the data okay so that function will will require the URL from",
  "so that function will will require the URL from where it have to it has to PCH that data from and next it will require the my email obviously okay for data generation so the thing is that after passing this text to chat GPT GPD for mini what it will do is that it will extract out those parameters these these two things these the the URL of this data. pi and the email ID from this text and it will return me those parameters which I can pass to my function and then it return work okay so that's",
  "function and then it return work okay so that's the very basic concept beond function calling okay so it's nothing much complex it's it's just you know just if you just copy this uh you just copy this text and ask chity to you know extract out these uh parameters from uh this text it will be able to do it okay so that's the entire thing that we are doing this is the entire concept of function calling okay and that's what we are going to build so uh if you guys see this that the function which",
  "uh if you guys see this that the function which is going to take the so this is the llm call okay so this is going to take the uh that is the okay so this is the Run uh if you guys are you must be definitely familiar with fast jpa and this is an end point on fast jpa okay let me just run this once and then I will be a to show you okay so I have uh activated my environment and that's recommended okay so what I will do is it's U ion so this is another uh method to run your past API applications",
  "uh method to run your past API applications which is UV icon the name of your application and then call an app so this app is nothing but uh this variable over here which contains our F appearances but you don't have to go to the much deps of that okay so U icon the name of your application column and then the name and then I re this will trigger up your uh P AP application and all right uh sorry guys I I had some technical difficulties okay is my screen visible okay so let's resume so our",
  "is my screen visible okay so let's resume so our first API endpoint is working perfectly so uh okay so this is the end point that we are okay so let's head to the this end point and what we will do is run this should be like this SL run task and then we're going to Define okay so uh let's say uh prepare a cake for me okay A C for okay let's Okay so this method is actually not allowed because okay the thing is that we are using a post okay so this is another thing that you have to keep in mind",
  "is another thing that you have to keep in mind that this function of your this run Endo of your should be a post function not a get okay and that's really that's very specifically mentioned in your project one documentation as well okay so you have to keep in mind that this should be a post function but for the moment I will just change it to get and one more thing if you guys are wondering that uh I have you know because some students have this had this problem that I am using a PCH over here",
  "had this problem that I am using a PCH over here and uh somehow Google is not allowing me to you know it's showing me this stupid error of method not allowed so this is actually not the error of Google because Google actually only supports get requests okay this is one thing to remember that Google always supports get requests and whenever you are going to uh do a post request open your post man okay so that's the best way open a post man and then you will be able to uh run that okay but for",
  "then you will be able to uh run that okay but for the sake of the session we make it get okay and I have to perhaps make some imports as well what I will do is I have few Imports already ready with me I will just copy and paste them all right they should solve all these yeah it solves everything okay so uh this is done and let's head to my one okay sh I think you are using oh get function you are using okay that is yeah I should Chang it okay so the thing is I guess uh let's try okay let's see",
  "the thing is I guess uh let's try okay let's see what's the issue this is okay it's allowing your methods uh you have a run and task prepare this this for me and it should get running okay what we can do is perhaps use post managed it once again okay so go run task and uh say prepare a cake for me okay let's run it method not allowed that's unexpected can you check your terminal where you running this server service yeah so showing me a bunch of stuff okay okay so tools not defined all right so",
  "stuff okay okay so tools not defined all right so the thing is that I'm utilizing tools let's just create a MP list okay this go to let's check okay it takes few seconds to Lo uh can you che check in the course if you have a mentioned all methods are active okay then what is the problem let's check once again uh okay so it has restarted the terminal once again let's check it meod not allowed okay okay can we check in Google developer console shift F12 uh sh developer control okay let's check",
  "F12 uh sh developer control okay let's check Network tab Network tab won't work because uh we are not ping anything from so it's just local storage and you know all those stuff so Jon this won't show much uh okay [Music] so unable to run it okay let's uh okay so it's head to run task and uh repare a cake let's go okay so method not let's let's head let's you know start making our uh application and then perhaps it would work let's check okay so we are so it is required let's check if it is",
  "so we are so it is required let's check if it is taking this task or not okay so let's check if it is taking our task then we should see we should be able to see prepare a cake for me over here and is it or is it not okay okay it's not printing it over here okay perhaps it's a fault of this AP this environment variable I assume no no no no I think otherwise it will get some request to machine let's let me just restart it there okay I think that I should this once now have we finish the task",
  "I should this once now have we finish the task yeah okay it's taking a lot of time I guess I should close this okay my was to be ion app app this open name and we will be running task and prepare a okay not allow uh Shan it's not even able to get the get request for back SL end point MH so can can you check if any of your mod man images are continuers are running right now maybe that I don't think so but let's check once yeah I guess it was running this closer let's check it once again it",
  "running this closer let's check it once again it should work yeah now it's working so that was my bad because actually I was running a p man service in the background and it was consuming this uh 8,000 Port that's why it was getting that okay so as you guys can see that I am able to fetch this prepare a cake and what I will be doing is that I will uncommit first and let's remove these and uh okay what are we going to do that we will be using tools and okay so let's save it and I will run",
  "tools and okay so let's save it and I will run another request of prepare a cake okay so yeah so it's not able to find so why did it give any uh an internal server because it's not able to find uh you know a function to call okay let's do one thing let's create a really simple function of what we're going to do okay so we uh I assume that I won't be creating a function from the pages but I will be creating a demo function okay so let's create a demo function for that uh we have to create a",
  "a demo function for that uh we have to create a function like we always do using Des okay uh let me create a function okay I'll be creating this function which will be death create oh let's make it bake a cake okay so bake cake and we'll take two arguments which will be uh let's say number of people number of uh people who have ordered it okay a number of people and it would be an integer and the flavor we want okay so the flavor would be a string all right and this a function and what we're",
  "all right and this a function and what we're going to do over here is that we will be returning a Json object with a message that uh let's say uh I will be creating a F string so if you guys don't know what is an F string so this is the time to know so uh I will be writing a message your uh let's add the flavor PST so this is how you can actually you know use variables in your uh strings so using an F string so just put an F in front of your quotes and then use curly brackets to add your",
  "quotes and then use curly brackets to add your variables okay so your flavor and cake for number people is now ready all right so this is our uh function and now the thing is that you have to pass this function somehow that LM will be able to understand okay so LMS are good with text okay so they won't so if you just pass your code to them then they will be able to understand so that needs to be a spring okay so for that what we're going to do is that we will be creating uh just copy an already",
  "that we will be creating uh just copy an already made function of mine because that's a lot of work to do okay so this is a function which I actually you know created for that extract the 16 chit code one okay that credit card one if you guys know what I'm talking about so uh this is this is something which you have to prepare for each and every function okay so let's name it big KCK and if you guys are wondering that why am I using you know caps lock over there so that's just to make a",
  "caps lock over there so that's just to make a distinction between the functions name and the name of this you know kind of pro name of this tool okay which I'm creating so tools are nothing but let me just create it then I will be able to explain you guys okay so uh what I'm doing is that I am creating this kind of you know prompt and uh it's actually a tool so it will just if you just just start reading it you will be able to understand so it's a type of function and the function its name is",
  "a type of function and the function its name is bake cake then the description so let's add a description so this uh uh so it's like uh this function D GES for only itm students okay so it has a kind of bias and it will only create only bakes for itting students okay so uh all right so it be takes all right and now uh let's add one more thing item students and need the flavor and flavor of cake so this can be so this description can be any text so in this description you have to tell what you",
  "so in this description you have to tell what you are actually expecting so you know whenever you are using multiple functions in your uh code so needs to figure out which function to use in this case Okay so let's say if I give a prompt so this is a prepare a cake for me prompt okay so it should understand it should relate which function it needs to use in this particular case Okay so yeah so it needs to figure out which kind of function which M so you have given multiple functions to it okay",
  "M so you have given multiple functions to it okay you have given multiple tools to it it needs to figure out which function it has to use in what case and to help it to assist it in that we are providing this this description okay so this is the fav of cake and for how many people I would recommend you guys to you know make it more detailed as possible because llm needs to you know the more detail you make your description llm will be able to figure out much quicker okay and much better so",
  "figure out much quicker okay and much better so there is a parameter and uh so in your parameters you will be specifying the the the the parameters that you are expecting from the user so these are the number of people okay so just remember that this is this should be the exact name and uh I will just copy these okay and this is an integer and over here we have to specify what this particular parameter is about okay so let's say if I give a prompt prepare a CES for me uh with flavor vanilla for",
  "prepare a CES for me uh with flavor vanilla for three people okay so this is going to be the prompt which I'm going to give it okay I won't run it at the moment because I know it's going to fail but when we create this it won't Okay so so when llm will be able so when llm will pass your uh text this entire text it should be able to figure out that vanilla is the flavor and it's being prepared for three people and for that you have to specify what you are expecting for the parameter okay so this",
  "you are expecting for the parameter okay so this so the number of people parameter should be the number of people uh the number of of people who want Ki all right and for the flavor the flavor of G okay and uh just pass it okay and just you know just keep these parameters as uh they are and simply add this in your tools okay so this should be able to work let's hope and let's run it internal Ser let's check the issue so it's saying that choices all right I guess it should be rerunning the",
  "all right I guess it should be rerunning the entire thing let's run it once again inter server choices name okay b g and we the response and should be a it's G us the choices one and we are using choices over here all right let's print this query once okay whenever you face any problems just print something okay can you demonstrate this thing using Thunder client also because uh you you referenced that while we were using yeah sure okay because I don't have that uh installed so post man yeah",
  "I don't have that uh installed so post man yeah yeah okay I can do that first at first I have to figure out what's the error the hold up and uh okay print query and is it printing query or not check okay okay it's not able to pass this somehow okay okay okay so when you see so this is the pro which I actually gave it just remove it remove this and this should be enough let's hope and uh it's expecting the Json response let's run it again internal server error it's not even printing the query",
  "server error it's not even printing the query okay P token none is invalid okay so is it not extracting the environment the environment uh okay uh is it [Music] passing what I will do is I will take it to another screen uh you guys can look at this s man for sry Postman for some time I will just figure it out because it is related to my uh you know my key so let me just have a look at it for okay [Music] okay done I guess [Music] okay it's taking some time yeah so uh it was an error of my",
  "taking some time yeah so uh it was an error of my environment variable so I just figured it out and uh this is your response so your vanilla cake for three is ready now okay so this was what we were expecting and this is what we got so this is called function calling and for this project you have to you have to make several uh you know you have to make uh several functions for all those questions and that's how you are going to solve it what I can do is uh because this was a really simple",
  "I can do is uh because this was a really simple example what I can do is I can uh show you guys that sorted contacts uh one as well okay so let me just copy it from my location all right so just like that one uh we are I'm going to you know use this sorted contact and before that let me generate my data okay because in this certain directory I don't have that data as you can see so for that it would be pretty simple uh U run and uh okay I have to go to that url url yeah this copy okay and I'll",
  "go to that url url yeah this copy okay and I'll be passing my email ID DS atm. a.n okay let's hope okay also I have to create this this parameter so this root parameter so if I just run it without this root parameter what it's going to do is that it will be storing it will be creating the data end point that data folder in my erve okay so this is this uh it won't be creating it inside this particular folder so for that what I will do is I will uh give I will pass another uh uh parameter which",
  "uh give I will pass another uh uh parameter which is this okay and it should be in that P one it all right so it has been created as you can see okay now uh I will be demonstrating how you can do this sorted contacts uh question so uh I just copied this from my actual code where I'm actually building my project one okay so this is the uh code for the sorted contacts and as you can see that in that question what we have to do that we have to sort the Json data so this is where we are where I'm",
  "the Json data so this is where we are where I'm actually you know uh reading the D Json data I'm just sorting it by last name first and then by first name and then just I'm you know converting it back to Json using Orient records so this is something which you can figure out using chat GPT that's pretty simple and Orient records and I'm just sending uh return message which St this this was successful and and the output location which we are expecting all right so uh what I will do is I will",
  "all right so uh what I will do is I will copy back that oh I don't think I need okay I need that so thing is that uh in this query gpg I gave a uh system prompt as well which you guys have to figure out why I won't be telling you okay so so this is done and now just like this I'm going to create another uh tool for it okay so can anyone tell me what should I how should I begin this how should I create the tool and what's the for Tool so first and foremost just someone open up your mic and just",
  "foremost just someone open up your mic and just tell me why what is the need for a tool to be created because obviously I have created this function what's the need for a tool to be created anyone understand the structure of the query correctly and switch it automatically yeah so who needs to understand the correct structure of the uh you know system system needs to understand actually it's going to be the L yeah going to C which needs to understand the you know the entire structure of your",
  "the you know the entire structure of your function okay so it won't understand what is this so if you just pass this code it perhaps it would but what we are going but we have to you know get specific directions to it so we are expecting this we are expecting this and then you have to give me this you have to you know you have to give this description as there so just like that you have to create a tool for it so can anyone tell me how can I how to begin with creating this tool anyone just open",
  "to begin with creating this tool anyone just open up your mic okay so let me initiate the first process which is copying this okay simply copy it no need to rewrite it again and it would be sorted contacts all right and just tell me what I what all I need to change any just open up your mic and you you can tell me what all I need to change the name should be uh sorted contacts exactly the name of the function exactly what should be the description the description uh can be the containing the",
  "the description uh can be the containing the last name and the first name of the contact or kind of that okay so so this is right not exactly the first name last name but uh the uh variables that last name should be there or first name should be there okay so the entire purpose for this description over here is that you have to the LM has to figure it so I just told you right so this particular Point LM has to figure out which function should I use okay so you have to tell it that what does",
  "I use okay so you have to tell it that what does this sorted contact function actually does okay so this would be this function sorts contacts in contacts uh this function sorts contacts from a file uh okay so it should be so it sorts contacts uh okay so let's make it more explicit it would be this function uh takes data from a Json file and what it does it starts the data first by last name then by first name okay and you also need to mention that then it stores it inside the specified",
  "that then it stores it inside the specified location all right so this so you should create a really good description for your functions that's why that's the only way will be able to understand okay and what should be my parameters someone just open up your mic and tell me guys this is your project and you should be you know stepping up and uh giving answers at this moment what should we parameters over here should I change this input input file and shorted Keys yeah uh input and what sorting",
  "and shorted Keys yeah uh input and what sorting is if needed like by first name and last name we are given right so if he wants dynamically pick up we have to give sorted that can also be done that's a really good option so what is uh telin is saying is that uh rather than specifying what uh rather than specifying the last name and then the first name what we can do is the user can also pass what all parameters it's it's you know it needs to uh the data needs to be sorted so let's say if the",
  "the data needs to be sorted so let's say if the user wants the function to be sort the function to sort the data and first name first and then the last name so this function won't be able to do this okay unless and until you make specific changes in this function okay but for the sake of the sake of this demonstration uh we'll be sticking to the asked question and what I am going to do is that firstly we will be passing this input location so whatever you are asking in this function you need to",
  "you are asking in this function you need to specify over there okay so input uh so uh okay so input location and output location okay and this needs to be a string obviously and uh the next one should be so we have to specify the relative location of the input file okay okay and the next one would be just copy this here location of the output file all right so our function has been our uh so one more thing we have to specify the requirements and these are the requirements all right so this",
  "and these are the requirements all right so this requires uh key actually specify that do you actually need this parameter or okay so the name is sorted contacts simply add it in your tool basket okay and it's done let's uh run our uh Postman once again and what I will do is I will uh copy the question from here okay so s array copy it and let's pass this okay so what's the error let's check what's that okay so okay okay so I haven't run the server all right it's running let's send it it has",
  "all right it's running let's send it it has started completing yeah it's running now let's hope it works okay so it has generated the data in uh this this is folder let's go ahead and check it uh it should be there it is it is okay so it's contact. Json and this has been sorted all right so this is how your function calling will work and it will you know solve your questions so one thing that you guys might face error with some problems with is that uh and you might face these errors so the",
  "is that uh and you might face these errors so the thing is that uh in these question s the locations which need to be specified the locations from where the file needs to be fetched from and the output location they are given like this okay so the problem which I was facing is that uh the file it's not able to the you know if if you pass this location to your L to your function not the LM if you pass the location to your L sorry function what it will do is that it won't be able to uh it won't",
  "will do is that it won't be able to uh it won't be able to understand where to create this file okay so this was an error which I face and I'm sharing it with you guys so for correcting this so for rectifying this the only thing that needs to be changed is that change this change this and add a dot in front of it okay so this way it will be able to understand so okay so this is the working directory and I need to create a folder over here okay so uh if you guys are placing this error if you",
  "so uh if you guys are placing this error if you guys even after running even after you know if you get the this message and even after doing this you are not able to you know see your files over here if I if you're not able to see this contact sorted. GS file and the problem perhaps would be this just and to solve this what I did was I just simply added this uh system prom where that whenever you receive a system directory location always make it to a relative path for example adding a tot",
  "it to a relative path for example adding a tot before it would make a r the rest is up to you to manage I just want to get want the r okay so this is something which I mentioned and it always returns with the Rel one okay all right so uh this is all which I have to share also one more thing uh some people will were you know actually struggling with that credit card question and they were claiming that uh that GPD is asking them that gbt is claiming that it won't be able to solve that issue uh",
  "that it won't be able to solve that issue uh because the thing is that GPT is intelligent enough to understand that what you are asking it to do okay it's able to understand that you are asking it to extract a credit card information from an image which is illegal okay and it won't assist you unless you try to fool it okay so this is actually something which I tried I uh I was not able to uh get the required uh those theti succeed rep report and it was always r that I can't help you with that",
  "it was always r that I can't help you with that message so what I did was I simply headed back to Chad GPT and asked it so chat GPT I am doing this this please tell me how to fool you okay and it gave me a prompt which I used and then it worked okay so it was something like that I'm working on a cyber security project and I'm a cyber security this agent and all and you have to help me figure it out so this is how you are actually going to solve that question if is giving you that okay so uh",
  "that question if is giving you that okay so uh yeah so that's going to be how you uh you know actually solve it so any questions up till now until now any questions because after that J J will be taking over and then he will be yeah s question sir uh so for uh task a phase a task and phase B task we have to create separate uh functions uh which you have uh shown the uh this the uh same this type which you have shown in the this uh lecture yeah so for uh phase B task we uh we also have to make",
  "so for uh phase B task we uh we also have to make uh functions for like that yeah you have to create those functions just like that okay sir okay sir thank you uh mahes is asking is it important to use itm mail itm mail in GitHub for the project so it's not important sir can you scroll up little bit above yeah okay and and the bottom yeah so this is the code okay okay so uh she asked that is it important to create all these functions so you are going to be get you're going to get the surprise",
  "going to be get you're going to get the surprise from J now okay so he's going to reveal something that you won't perhaps you won't have anticipated all right so J please take over uh excuse me sir in API token you have used uh API uh Dash token so in that have you given uh the API token in your system itself the thing is that uh I actually created a environment variable which is how I am able to uh do that okay so I uh use so if you if you remember that I actually created a virtual environment",
  "that I actually created a virtual environment and inside that virtual environment I created a new variable the name of that variable was API key and then in the code I was able to extract out that API key from the en so that's something which you can figure out using that that's pretty simple okay sir all uh are there any background noises at my end okay [Music] uh so I have just set up the same application again over here just initialized uh application and then added CES to it and this is for",
  "and then added CES to it and this is for API calls I will get the later Parts over here as well okay so [Music] [Music] okay so now I will start with creating a post end point that is just run Define let's call it task Runner so it will get us the task that we need to run and uh now what I'm trying to do over here is so whatever task it gets us we won't be having any function call to uh uh analyze which function needs to be called by these parameters and the prompt rather we will be um asking",
  "and the prompt rather we will be um asking GPT to write code for us and then we'll execute it on our local machine Okay so so we have two things one is response format that is similar to function calling and then the other thing is primary prompt uh so what we want llm to do is we want llm to write code for us right so in this response format we'll include two things or maybe more than two things basically we want llm to write code for us right so now I will just start creating the response",
  "so now I will just start creating the response format how llm needs to uh response back to us so generally when we write something okay wait a second uh so whenever we type something over here then it will generate some code but it will have some extra bits upside and then downside we have to copy that code and then we have to stick it in a text editor and then we have to run it uh but we won't be able to do in the automated script right so for that we'll have to provide the format to GPT that",
  "that we'll have to provide the format to GPT that we want in this format so that we can just get the code out of it and then we can run that code right so response now I will Define the response format it is just similar to the uh function calling we can even use function calling over here and then it syntax is a bit different but uh we can even convert it to function calling okay so name of that function is Task Runner and then we have schema that contains the information about that particular",
  "contains the information about that particular function and it's type as object and now we will define the properties PR p r p o r okay so when when you get code back from GPT what all are the things that you are uh you actually care about um we only need the code right mostly that is the important bit but while creating a UV script we also need these additional bits uh for installing some dependencies right so in properties that is what we going to Define so I will see it is python code and",
  "to Define so I will see it is python code and then this python code so we need code so code will be in string format and then we will put some description for that code DS p and this is the python code that we need for executing a particular task and the extra bits we need is we also need the uh depend dependencies that we need to install Okay so and dependencies can be more than one so it must be a list of values right python tiend denes D okay and then it will be array and then each array",
  "and then it will be array and then each array will have a object and let's define what that object will be module is the basically name of uh the module so for example this is fpi so its type will be string and then we need some description DC d c i p t o n name of python module okay and now let's mention what all things are required so from this particular um list Fe basically need each of these modules and we don't need anything extra than this so setting this additional properties as false",
  "so setting this additional properties as false will not generate anything extra other than just getting the list of modules okay and after that we have already defined python code we have defined Python dependencies and these are the two things that we required to exec Ute any code that is ined by llm so let's put a required block somewhere over here r q u i RoR is it okay so Python dependencies and then the other thing that we need is python code all right and now we need the primary Pro promp",
  "all right and now we need the primary Pro promp so for any request we'll be having a generic prompt let me Define it here uh so basically when we are sending this task what it requires to do it actually it is kind of an automated agent right which generate which is expected to do these tasks or these additional bits so for that we'll first say you are in um okay you will be given a task to perform uh your response must just use or or rather we can say just your you are you will be given a task",
  "say just your you are you will be given a task to perform um let me make it more you are an automated aut agent so please so generate rate python code that does the specified task and then we'll also mention uh assume UV and python is pre installed um I assume that code you generate will be executed inside a Docker container in order to perform any task if some python package is required to install provide name of those modules okay uh I think this much is so this this prompt is is not very",
  "this much is so this this prompt is is not very robust but this is just a basic prompt by giving a more robust prompt we can make things very explicit so now we have prompt with us now we'll make a request request. post and then URL is equal to URL headers is equal to headers and then Jason is equal to this data so we have response format over here and then this primary prompt is over here and then R is equal to tr pa. Jason uh we need to store it in response variable and for now let's just",
  "it in response variable and for now let's just return all okay um so now what I will do I will just get one of these task and then uh just pass it to GPD GP rather this agent before I do that let me just check if some pman thing or Docker is running okay nothing is running so and let me create one more function that is just to check if our server service is running um some uh Define home page and this will say return welcome to task Runner uh method is not allowed okay let me check why method",
  "is not allowed okay let me check why method is not allowed we are getting request and we have a end point oh it is get it should get so now gets the data all right uh now we will go to this particular we'll try to send a post request to this end point for that I will open vs code HTTP Local Host 8,000 then frun task someone someone asked that you should show using Thunder CL as well so this is where we are using Thunder uh you can just see that it's pretty much the same process as Postman just",
  "it's pretty much the same process as Postman just install the extension for uh C and you can just start running your API requests okay okay so let's get this task and let's make a request is there there anything that we need to parameterize a list of one or more per line and then okay that is okay let's send a request oh method is not allowed this is you have to make it right get okay thanks thanks okay so now in the response what we have got is this particular python code so GPT have generated",
  "this particular python code so GPT have generated this python code let us write it out to a file um so we have response in R and then from that we need choices from that we need a zero index and for in zero index we'll get this so we need message and from message we need content okay let's get this so it have python code as one key and then the other key is this python dependencies oh Docker file dependencies why does it get this we'll check that later so rather than send returning this I will",
  "later so rather than send returning this I will use turn this thing and let's rerun the [Music] server okay so now we have got a python code and then we have what else do oh python dependencies these are two different arrays maybe I can do keys to get the keys oh internal server a string object has no attribute Keys okay so since it's a string we'll need to use Json to convert it to a valid Json object or rather we can call it dictionary jason. loads [Music] and okay internal server eror okay",
  "loads [Music] and okay internal server eror okay rather than converting it to Keys let's first do [Music] this uh yeah so this gets the AL so it have python code in Python code variable and then it have python dependencies and each of these dependencies are the name of the module so now what we want to do we want to write this code out to a file uh let's do that so we'll get the code [Music] and with open lmore code and write it out to a file f. WR and uh how do I write it out uh just use the",
  "WR and uh how do I write it out uh just use the python code and let's send one request it will create a file which will have the code and this is the file that it have created so let's have a look at the task uh it will so this particular file have list of the dates one per line and then count the number of fness days in this list so it gets the input file path and then it gets the output file path which is this thing and then it initializes when this count as zero then it opens this input file",
  "this count as zero then it opens this input file and then it goes line by line and then it um removes all the white spaces that are there in the date and then it will it will convert it to datetime object and then it will just check if the week day is equal to two which is for wedness days and if that is correct then it will increment one to it and otherwise it will catch some exception in case if that date is not valid I mean it format is not valid so now this is code that we have got from llm",
  "so now this is code that we have got from llm and we haven't used function calling anywhere but but but for executing any script we also need one more thing um that is on top of this we need this inline script so let's add that over here so uh this is python code and I will also put inline meta data script so this is going to be let me just copy this thing from here to here all right and now actually these dependencies they they will be coming dynamically right so for that we need to get these",
  "right so for that we need to get these dependencies from here um oh okay I have changed it but that is a key right which have python dependency is so we'll create one key python tipen C is equal to I will copy this piece of code and then I will just change the last bit all right and this should should be a bit above and now all these dependencies should be dynamically added over here so uh for that we use this piece of code so let's read off this it should be Python dependencies and is there",
  "it should be Python dependencies and is there something uh okay I need to make it F string so that it gets these things uh before we execute it let's test it on a small example I Python 3 and dependencies we have these as the dependency and then we also need so this is the code that we have and in okay let's call it dependencies instead of python dependencies and now let me print it out okay um I will import PR print and PR print do pprint in line meod to script so it have a script and then it",
  "meod to script so it have a script and then it have the version of python then it have the dependencies and these dependencies are coming correctly okay so this will generate dependencies then this will get the code let me first write out all the dependencies is there something what is going on uh metadata metad data you have to write inline metadata uh metadata right uh where oh sorry sorry sorry correct correct it should be in line metad okay um now let's check if it creates this file which",
  "um now let's check if it creates this file which have in dependencies as well I will send another request and let's let's have a look at this script so it have all these dependencies then it sir uh hi sir screen screen is not moving just stop um Can anyone confirm is if if my screen is moving or not yeah screen internet is lagging all right Andrew you have a question yeah I just wanted to see whether you will evaluate because this one right according to that fer module the date times are",
  "according to that fer module the date times are different like so just one specific date time so I just wanted to know whether this one wouldn't work format of something like that you're not Audible that format of those dates yeah yeah this won't accept the dates right in according to the Val this will accept the dates actually that uh we are passing the date and it should accept not really because if you go look at the evaluate file right that Faker it'll give different formats uh yes sir if",
  "Faker it'll give different formats uh yes sir if possible please import that evaluate. py file and the left one above email text below credit card yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that it won't be able to because actually have to use parcel for this and passor will be able to uh okay what we can do is uh you can try running this once uh if we don't receive the expected response then I will share you the code with the par Ser one okay so you can just go ahead and run the script As You Wish okay sure",
  "go ahead and run the script As You Wish okay sure I think we'll need to prompt LM a bit better so that itates parts right we have to tell that we have dates in multiple formats and you have taken into account that those formats won't be perhaps soled using date module so yeah so maybe as part of this prompt [Music] um all right take take the dates text only and you can send the data from it only it's allowed so you can do that uh so yeah sending data to llm is allowed but then this file can be",
  "data to llm is allowed but then this file can be a very big file exactly so what we can do is you can just specify that we have uh multiple uh we have dates in multiple formats and those formats are you can just give few examples ddmm by sort of that and then you have to ask it to produce a code which will be able to pass through all these date times and you know give the best results possible so we have to specify this into the LM hello sir just one yes sir uh you are a yeah please ask",
  "sir just one yes sir uh you are a yeah please ask question sir just one thing uh after uh when the when in the codes are written the create a file and then make a python code and copyed it so uh after creating the file and writing the code in it we have to run it also uh for the project MH so that it can give answers uh so that it can provide answers also yeah yeah for that I guess we will be using sub processes yeah sorry sorry sorry okay uh I was saying yes we will be using subprocess module",
  "was saying yes we will be using subprocess module for executing the code that is generated by gbpt so sub process is a module which will actually be which can actually which can run data on your you can which can run few uh Powers shell commands on your behalf so yeah yeah please ask a question I just have one more question because like um during the evaluation right once we produce the code we can't check the output from the code like how you expect it like to give a feedback loop like I don't",
  "it like to give a feedback loop like I don't know if I'm clear enough like if the data is the not format is not accepted right there's no way for us to know to that it's wrong we just submit it but if we had like okay be like this even during the evaluate now it's not needed okay then we can like dynamically put that okay it's this is wrong then why is it wrong because you probably don't have different formats right but that's there's no way for us to access that or know about that that's what",
  "us to access that or know about that that's what I want to know so what you were saying is that uh you are expecting that uh when it returns that your answer is not correct he'll just give wrong right because uh after we because there's no like there's no feedback look because it's API right once we get it it gives it back and then we're done we don't interact no what you can do is what you can do is by the way it's it's giving you the expected response and the uh response that you have given",
  "response and the uh response that you have given to him so is that pardon I'm saying that it will give you thei it will give you the expected response yeah but then that will be marked wrong no it's not like in between where we can reprompt the llm from seeing the input once we get it we it's a one time thing after we prompt the llm we get the python code we execute it and then then you check it like if it gives a dates sorted or dates Wes Day text or whatever and then the get get API reads it",
  "or whatever and then the get get API reads it again there's no way for us to rewrite the code one even if you get the wrong one right over here here it only get some dates right from the text or it might throw an error also uh if it depends on this thing like if you use a tri block or not and then it'll just be the wrong uh number of dates in the dates wenesday text and then the get file will read that wrong dates text evaluate it as wrong and then move on that's what I'm saying so you're",
  "and then move on that's what I'm saying so you're saying that this file which is going to be created using uh lenss you won't be able to debug it somehow yeah yeah yeah no not debug it it'll be right like you can execute it and see whether it gives Code Zero sub process that but you won't be able to understand the task yeah yeah the task was right or so Andre so the solution to that would be like in this Pro in in in this Json schema that we have created to uh get what do we call it response",
  "created to uh get what do we call it response format right yeah before this we can send one request in that request we can include 20 lines or first 25 lines and yeah of the input file and we send it to GP and then we ask it please yeah got it got it got it got it it please consider this and got it got it got it correct correct get parer correct correct correct yeah because we have access to read it before hand yes awesome awesome by thank you uh I'm wondering why you didn't get this dependency",
  "I'm wondering why you didn't get this dependency of date time is it inil module date time yeah is it in in Python is it yes it is oh I didn't new so I think there is no need of dependencies then all right so this is the code that we have got now we need to execute this piece of code and so now we'll use process module import run and we have got this python code written out into this LM code file and now we need [Music] to open this file in the readable mode ah no we don't even need to open this",
  "mode ah no we don't even need to open this file we just need to execute it right so I will use run command and CMD is it C okay first one is the command that we need to run so we'll pass that command so we need to run llm code so lmore code. pi and then we'll capture the out output by capturing the output means we'll capture what it actually generates and then we'll get it in the text format and then from where we want to execute it we want to execute this command from current working directory",
  "this command from current working directory all right so this is what we have okay and this is output is equal to this thing and let me just print the output okay this is output and let's also return maybe it won't be able to return so just print it out so I think this for to execute that code which have been generated um okay so let's do that [Music] um oh I didn't restart server okay it does it could not find this file right that is because this this particular file is in my local this",
  "this this particular file is in my local this directory not as the root rate so now I will just move to Docker containers so that we can create a file in the root directory I don't want to create uh this file in my root directory that's why doer file and then this is the code that we are having and this we will execute ab. Pi all right and let me build this image before that let's have a look at which all images are already present okay so we already have one task Runner modman build hyph T and",
  "have one task Runner modman build hyph T and let's call it task or let's rather call it TDS is Project one and and yeah this should be from this file and create username uh token okay all right maybe then I will do it from here I'll bring this terminal to other screen to export API token CP okay um so B man is it build Hy T DDS project one and Dot so we have 8,000 sir is it possible sir may I ask a question yes yes sure sir is it possible that every time we run the file uh and we give a task to",
  "time we run the file uh and we give a task to a f uh to an app then it will create uh the same file with the with uh with the uh rewrite code which the task wants and then we can run the same file or we have to create a separate file for each task uh okay um I think better to create separate files so I think the evaluate. pi it will be sending some asynchronous request so in that case it is better to keep in separate file okay sir thank you sir yeah okay did it create yes it have Boardman",
  "sir yeah okay did it create yes it have Boardman images Boardman run DDS Pro what is the command Hy proxy _ token is equal to Dollar proxy pxy and port number mapping is 8,000 to 8,000 and then image ID axiore okay so let's first test if this particular endpoint is working or not and in terminal yes we are getting these requests here so now I will send one request to this endpoint um but before that we need to install data right so we don't have data at the moment inside our there sorry it's",
  "data at the moment inside our there sorry it's there the data there uh and I could not understand data is there data is there the folder is there data folder no it won't be there right because I have just okay yeah yeah so it's just this particular file so actually see we want be doing so right now what I will be doing I will be going inside that particular container and then I will be uh installing data using that script but that you should not do that okay because this this particular URL",
  "not do that okay because this this particular URL might change and then email address that might also change so right now I will just be hard coding to save time okay otherwise I will have to add something to The Prompt like right right now GPT is not capable of running UV commands Okay so we need we might need to say uh if you need to run any UV script then use UV run and then name of the script and then some arguments so this maybe we have to specify uh this is not a good prompt I think it",
  "specify uh this is not a good prompt I think it will fail uh you can think of some good prompt but right now I will just hard code it okay odman or the containers so this is the running container we'll get in that container or man excc interactive terminal and then BH all right and now I need to execute UV run and this is the script oh and then I 22 32542 ds. story. tm. ac.in okay it have created data inside root folder yeah y so now actually this is not restarting the server So like um earlier",
  "is not restarting the server So like um earlier Shan had rent it using UV con and then space app colon app that would restart by itself so this doesn't restart so for that what I have to do I have to actually stop the server so I mean I I have to shut down this container and then restart it for some reason I'm not able to interrupt oh okay so now I will stop this particular oh container okay I think it's already been stopped yes yeah okay then we can start it again and this is container ID oh B",
  "can start it again and this is container ID oh B man PS hyph and pman start container ready okay this should have started it again let's check okay it's running and and now we'll send the task okay sent okay so podman logs 86 and let's have a look get logs and it gets few things on a standard error uh completed the process and return code is we have got some error and on standard output we didn't get anything and this is the error standard error downloading setup download set tools installed",
  "downloading setup download set tools installed four packages and then this is Trace pack error line number 16 module V Next Day Count some 14 date in dates if date dot some some some some error is there and I think this is some issue with some formatting does not match this particular format all right board man so one thing that we can do is we like I just said we can feed first 10 or 20 lines of uh 10 20 or 25 lines of content of that particular file or but that's not what I'm going to do now",
  "file or but that's not what I'm going to do now I will be writing a self correcting Loop so we have got some error here and now I will be feeding this particular error to GPT back oh so Andrew you seems to be confused I don't know I I I got I thought like this one will take kind of a little bit longer to run know because once we get the call if you do it in feedback loop maximum we can do once or twice and then after that it's gone like we'll be timed out I just I thought maybe you'll read the",
  "timed out I just I thought maybe you'll read the data and then send it directly um yeah see if you read the data I mean I'm sure it will generate accurate code yeah that's that's that's that's the that's the that's the but I think that I will do in the uh what do you call it uh recent request okay I or or or we can even includes like when we get the task we send the task to LM and we we ask which are the input files and then we get the name of that input file and then we read it and then we",
  "that input file and then we read it and then we feed the data of that file to GP that's I thought yes um but but like right now I'm thinking to create a self writing so that if there is some error then I mean we can we could do oh okay okay let let me write the uh code that uh um um J yes uh we'll do one thing we'll put on one more session for tomorrow and uh then we can uh show the self correcting uh code as well as uh showing how you can get the prompt to work correctly okay okay yeah you can",
  "prompt to work correctly okay okay yeah you can do that uh next session because it's already 10 now uh we don't want the session to run long so so can we get this py after the session sorry the what can we just stay for maybe 10 15 so can can we get this python file after the session no no we won't give the code but uh uh we can still run the session for a bit longer if you want so that he finishes the error correcting Loop if you want to see that yeah eror some time to debug and decode if you",
  "yeah eror some time to debug and decode if you just directly read the data before you officially read it you just send the code every alternate line or some other type of stochastic this thing where you read it and then send it it will be able to with some probability get the right prompt at least that's what I WR I mean but I don't know I'm not sure it'll probably work that yeah there are two aspects to it one is give it a sample of the input the second aspect is better prompt so um if you",
  "the second aspect is better prompt so um if you write a robust prompt that also works so both those techniques work and you can use them in combination to get nearly bullet bulletproof code so both both aspects and the error error correcting is um useful because uh you don't want your code to instantly fail so at least uh the ability to uh once in a while correct is also very very useful um the advantage of um having very strong prompts and very and providing some sample data is that you're uh",
  "and providing some sample data is that you're uh very rarely going to ever have a have your code fail but in the event it fails it's good to know how to write the self correcting uh prom that's that's that's what we are trying to get to so that to show you these things these three techniques basically and then you don't have to ever write any function calls you just feed the task and it literally does everything for you without writing 20 different function calls okay J I'll let you take a call",
  "function calls okay J I'll let you take a call on this uh you can decide if you want to just continue for a little bit more I think some students are very keen so okay uh uh okay if we do to okay like I'm thinking should we uh do this feed these upper some 2025 lines and then we show that but then that will take time so maybe we can do it tomorrow final date of project is 15th right yeah if you do tomorrow then uploading video will be released on 15th only right how Okay okay then we'll do do",
  "on 15th only right how Okay okay then we'll do do it right now all right we'll do it right now so just to clean some things from here I will just put this piece of code so so so oh okay okay let's first have a look at the output so in output we have got uh this return code and then we have standard output and then we have a standard error right so we can fetch these three things in different variables oh so this is output output and then dot it is a strandard error this will have error let's",
  "is a strandard error this will have error let's call it ER so this will have standard error and let's have what all we can get other than this standard output let's store it in some other variable maybe it is useful to store it uh let's call it a standard output stt out and output Dot and we'll also call this as standard error now we have these two things let's get this return code as well um what should I call it exit code do we call it exit code right so I think whenever we execute something",
  "right so I think whenever we execute something from terminal generally I think we call it uh exit code if I'm not wrong and other than that is there something useful from here standard error stand standard error okay so if you look at this standard error it get it shows some downloading steps right here so you have to uh strip search for Trace back and and then you can do it from there yes yes yes yes so that's what I will do now so maybe we can use this file variable like this whenever it",
  "can use this file variable like this whenever it starts from file that's where the actual error is right so this is not the actual error it is just some downloading stuff and then this is the actual error that is there okay so U from now I will Loop range I can actually in range so this is standard error I can split it using back sln so in every line it will have back sln so let's do that um do split and use back sln over here okay and for I in range Len of Len of tenter error so if there is",
  "range Len of Len of tenter error so if there is some error then if a standard error of I dot let's do some stripping and if it starts with file uh the word file that's where the actual error is then we'll raise some exception so so I think standard error is a string by itself no sir and then if you extract each character I think that will be character wise no I think I'm not sure uh actually I have splited it using back sln oh okay okay okay oh okay yeah so let's put put it inside a try catch",
  "okay yeah so let's put put it inside a try catch block now maybe this whole thing I will put it inside try catch so that we can raise some exception because of that error Str error um all right of maybe I till end so they are is from this particular thing right so this is the error and now we need to catch this error so exception as e and let's print this e stringy so I will first uh try to execute this code and then if some error comes it will come here and then it will print it error to our",
  "come here and then it will print it error to our console okay sir you can use logging if you want it'll be easier uh actually I'm not familiar with the uh just import logging logging doino in a string just enter that you can add it in the script line dependency oh no no you can directly import from your just loging and then loging info in string that's it I that's over here right yeah where wherever you're printing so yeah loging info and you can okay so it will log it to console right yeah",
  "can okay so it will log it to console right yeah yeah yes all right all right I think not sure I think okay okay okay okay we'll check who was that andry right yes sorry thanks thanks uh but actually either now now I can either rebuild the image or else I can copy this code from here and then I can stick it inside the inside this container so I will just copy this code from here maybe it will I think okay maybe I will copy this whole code and let's get inside the oh let's get in the container",
  "get inside the oh let's get in the container AB oh VI is I will use fim Editor to edit files now okay guess insert control shift V and then and pman pman PS okay this process is running I need to stop it oh before that let's check which all processes are running okay I need to stop this process and and now I need to restart because I have changed the code and now let's make a request sent right did this request complete okay uh it have completed and in info we have got 200 okay oh that means",
  "and in info we have got 200 okay oh that means there was no EST standard error and there was no EXT standard output as well and return code was zero and we were able to successfully execute this file okay and now let's get back to okay uh BH and let's have a look at which all files are there let's have a look at the content of this particular file okay it m must have created a file and let us have oh what did I do some garbage let me get I think I didn't copy that line of P cat llm code dop so",
  "I didn't copy that line of P cat llm code dop so I need to get the path of this file and I need to C this so it get get gets a answer is 32 okay but I'm sure this answer is not correct that is because of format parsing so it might be considering few of them but it is not exact correct answer right so if there is some error then it it will just send that error to standard uh error stre right but at the moment there was no error so while executing this task there was no error all right so if",
  "this task there was no error all right so if there is some error then what we can do um okay there is so much code so I will move it to some function maybe from here I will move let's this a bit up and let's move this code to Let's create some other function define llm code executor [Music] and this have this particular piece of code line me script so we need to pass python dependencies now let me copy this variable from here and we also need python code and now we can call this function from",
  "code and now we can call this function from here okay so I was talking about some error correcting Loop and let's also get the task okay no no no no no uh now I will create a another function define recent request so this will have task and then this will also have code and then error so generally what we used to do whenever we prompt GPT we will ask it to do some task and then it will generate some code we will execute that code and then if we get some error in that case we'll actually feed",
  "get some error in that case we'll actually feed that error back to GPT with the same task and then with the same code okay and so how do we do request so something yeah and Andre you want to ask something I I think because the logging uh info right supp error or raise exception I'm not sure exactly but maybe because of that only we couldn't get the error yeah that one oh no no no no that is because see I have also printed the output of the process in that also it says written code is zero and",
  "in that also it says written code is zero and then nothing on try catch know that info I don't think it's raising I think I'm not sure exactly maybe something but yeah but you can continue this okay okay uh maybe I can store it in some variable then actually see I don't even want to log it we we can keep a logging uh info over here but along with logging I also want to feed it back to LM right so that's why we'll store it in one variable as well so while sending the request back our prompt",
  "well so while sending the request back our prompt needs to be adjust so so so okay our task needs to be adjusted so we'll call it updated _ task and this should have three things uh one is the task so I will say update the python code and I will mention the code um and for this for for below task and we'll feed task back and this error and countered while running task all right so this is prompt for resending the request it have code it have task and then it also have error all right and after",
  "and then it also have error all right and after getting response back we again want to get the python dependencies uh no okay so this is how we are sending the request again right all right so from this llm code executor maybe if it successfully able to get us the code then maybe I will say um return successes and otherwise return error all right and let's call it this thing so so whatever we gets from the output back from let's store it in output after execution okay we can just call it output",
  "after execution okay we can just call it output doesn't matter so uh now if um um success if it was a successful thing then we'll just return R TN successfully task completed and let us say it was an error L if output of error yeah in that case if if we get an error what we want to do we want to feed it back to GPT right so now we we'll use this recent request function so now we need code and error is already here so error I will copy paste from here and this code this I can read it from this",
  "here and this code this I can read it from this file all right so with open and we want to open lmore code. p and in readable mode as F code is equal to f. read so okay uh this will resend the request and then it will get some other code and after we get the code we'll call it response so now I want to re-execute the function this function and we want these things back from the response and let's store this response over here uh response we already have we want this thing in Jason okay all",
  "already have we want this thing in Jason okay all right so this will send one request but um so we might want to send multiple request to correct T code so we'll create a while loop in that case and let's call it um number of executions so how many times you want to execute if it is not generating the corre correct code let us say two times maybe uh if um um okay no let's start it from zero okay basically what I am showing is we can put this recent request inside a y Loop so that it corrects",
  "request inside a y Loop so that it corrects multiple time okay and before that let let's first uh let's store it in output all right I tried rewriting the end point but okay okay so the thing is if it is successful uh so then it just returns something and let's see if it is not successful we can even put it inside a uh infinite file Loop like keep running until GPD doesn't give correct answer this will keep sending request again and again again and again but never do this run it two or three",
  "and again but never do this run it two or three times okay maybe something like this we can set a limit and then limit we can always increase it by one and this way it won't send more than two times so this is self right self correcting Loop it will execute the code generated by LM and then it will resend the request and what uh Andrew was mentioning about we can even feed the content of these these 15 20 lines and then we can actually uh ask llm to so so while we are sending the first request",
  "to so so while we are sending the first request instead of actually asking directly for the code what we can ask for we can ask for the input file uh that is part part of input file that we need to read and then we can get the content of that file and then we can feed it to GPT system yeah for for the prompt purpose so I think it will generate a better code yes with system prompt you can say you'll be given a file like this system prompt and then give off the data and then you'll give it back I",
  "give off the data and then you'll give it back I think I think all right so yeah this is for today's session [Music] and all right and the other thing that I want to mention is that so if we go to this um where is this uh week three module so over here there is some uh instructions about how you can write really good prompts so if your prompt is very good then uh the code that llm will generate will be of very high quality so like we have a a script that just have 160 lines of code and it it",
  "script that just have 160 lines of code and it it doesn't use any function calling it doesn't even have the self-writing loop but it is very accurate it get gets very good result and that is Al alone because of this uh nice prompts that we we are using excuse me sir yeah and can I just can we just go through like a revision of just from starting to top because you have to remember it I mean I mean like because like the I mean I just need to like not memorize it but like to get it because I",
  "like not memorize it but like to get it because I don't think are releasing the videos for another one or two days one day maybe so we can just go through and like a revision just from top to bottom just explain our fast sure sure sure sure sure and Andrew the video will release tomorrow morning anyway oh okay but yeah just like one I I'll probably start now again this this new method seems very promising so I'll just just like to get it okay moreover within two to three hours this video will",
  "within two to three hours this video will be processed and it will beable on your calendar as well so if you just go to calendar and you will be able to see this video in the link itself yeah in the link itself just click over there and you will be able to you know it will give you the transcript of that yeah I just want to go through it now because I'll yes exactly it's very confusing right now we are too much confused just one small recap just one recap yeah sure sure sure I I mean I'm just",
  "one recap yeah sure sure sure I I mean I'm just showing what Shan yeah so this is how you can access it okay I mean it will be accessible just two or three hours after the session ends anyway so so uh like what we have done we have actually created one uh so this is our prompt which definitely is not a good prompt we can have a much better prompt than this particular prompt so if we if you go to this particular week three module then it tells how to create a good prompt so like over here um",
  "how to create a good prompt so like over here um clear direct and detail so it also depends on the grammar that you use and basically you need to provide some examples as well so um like uh given this script it is satisfied think step by step so directly instruct the model to break down reasoning into steps yeah so this is how you can construct one good like you put some instruction and then you give it some example and and this is very good way of giving examples in these specific blocks okay",
  "of giving examples in these specific blocks okay and then you can even use markdown to make your prompt good and then use Json so actually if you if you write efficient prompt so this particular prompt is not too good okay this is very bad prompt I can say for sure and yeah so here we have one example of a promp so which you can go through as a Content reviewer for a high school uh level courses on Tools in data science your job is to evaluate provided content such as text C cipit or references",
  "content such as text C cipit or references with the focus correctness so this is what the prompt is then correct for correctness so it have these bold things and then it also mentions in every part particular step what is required right so this is how you can create a quality content so I will pref I will suggest to go through these three um sections of week three module okay and you can create very good prompt and so we actually have one script which have just 160 lines of code which doesn't",
  "which have just 160 lines of code which doesn't have any function calling and it doesn't even have this self-writing Loop but still it gets very good result and that is just because of prompts okay so that's why I'm emphasizing on writing efficient PRS okay so basically that script which J is talking about that 160 lines of code script so that script is capable of solving that entire project one in one go okay so it's able to solve the all those 10 questions of uh phase a and the 10 questions",
  "10 questions of uh phase a and the 10 questions of phase b as well which are so phase B is a lot of so it contains a lot of ambiguity and still it's able to solve those questions so that's the power of prompt engineering at display okay so yeah just you know just go through the content which is which was provided in the large language modules uh models section and uh learn about PR Eng so that's the best thing you can do so yeah so I will reemphasize using just better prompt you can do it very",
  "using just better prompt you can do it very easily and using good prompts you these tasks can also be done so function calling won't help to to these tasks right any arbitrary task it won't help to do any arbitrary task so coming back over here so we have this as the primary prompt which mentions you are an agent and these these these things and these are the things that are pre-installed and then we would be running it inside a Docker container and over here U so this is the endpoint which",
  "and over here U so this is the endpoint which gets the task and then it sends a API call to llm and then in response it gets Python dependencies and then python code and then we have a code llm code executer which actually collects these Python dependencies and then creates inline metadata script and the python code that we have and then we'll stick it inside this particular file and after stick it sticking in inside this file uh we are actually running it using you a subprocess module in",
  "running it using you a subprocess module in Python okay and then we are capturing output and that is in text format so output have multiple different things so we are interested in using a standard error and then there is nothing that comes on a standard output I thought it might be useful that's why I have just restored it and then exit code is it tells about if there was some error while executing uh the code so we you can even use this thing while raising this exception we can just use I",
  "while raising this exception we can just use I think exit code it might work I haven't tried that's why I haven't used I have tried this way okay and then if there was no error then we are just returning that okay so code was successfully able to execute so it it was able to execute the code there was no error while executing the code and if there is some error then we are raising that exception okay and after raising the exception we are capturing it um over here in output and then if output",
  "it um over here in output and then if output is successful then we are just sending task completed successfully and if that output had some error okay if it is not equal to null I think I should put not equal to n um maybe something like this uh then it will open this piece of code and then it will also send the task and then this so it will send it to resend request so this basically to uh resend the code that was generated by llm along with the task and along with the error that we",
  "with the task and along with the error that we encountered while running the task all right and then we are executing this recent request two times so basically it will send one request and then if there was some error then it will send two more request if still there is some error then it will get out of this V Loop okay so that is the re but yeah uh this is very weak prompt if you give detailed prompt it will be able to solve all of those tasks all right so yeah now you guys can ask doubts so",
  "all right so yeah now you guys can ask doubts so will there be a session tomorrow also sir okay not like if it's feasible I mean because this one was a long time that's it okay uh we we can have session but uh just fine tuning a little bit maybe because I might this is a new totally new paradigm so I thought maybe I have I could ask discour I post also takes no one replies in discour very fast so what uh so Andrew do you want to ask something like do you have some doubt to discuss like I don't",
  "do you have some doubt to discuss like I don't have anything to discuss other than this um what we have discussed today okay okay no no problem thank you actually the thing is that whatever we plan for project one sessions has been completed so uh yeah so I don't think that we need another session for discussing more if you guys have questions you can ask them right now otherwise uh you can you know ask on discourse as well that's an always an open platform for you guys to ask questions so yeah",
  "platform for you guys to ask questions so yeah yeah for sure ask question actually I have asked question in the starting of the session as well that uh I've uh mailed the I mailed the query to javat Sir uh sir you have provided uh that uh I I should write messages in instead of message I tried that also but it's still on the post request it is giving me the same error which I have uh showed you in the mail uh okay okay okay can you show share your screen yes sir sure sir sir uh here is the code",
  "screen yes sir sure sir sir uh here is the code sir uh which you have discussed first in the I've just write the exact code because I want to try because sir I've always get some problem in these uh app kind of uh questions as well in graded assignment that's why I want to try first that code is still running and post request is functioning in my system or not that's why I'm doing so I've can you demonstrate what error you are facing actually actually I facing this error sir also facing that",
  "actually I facing this error sir also facing that error in the session but sir modified something and the error was gone and it is giving what's the okay so it's invalid schema for functions script Runner okay not is not a object Boolean okay uh type invalid request and okay so this is uh it's returning so this is a problem in the function call them just show me once yes sir the function okay scroll on yes uh where is your function to run this sorry sir uh can you scroll back up yes sir uh",
  "sorry sir uh can you scroll back up yes sir uh where is your function to run this specific tool sir actually uh sir in the last I can you scroll just take me to the tool using yes sir just scroll down yes slowly stop uh this script Runner where is this uh function yeah okay sir the function I've named is Task Runner that's why it's uh giving me error that's that's a mistake you doing try changing it once and let's hope it works sir it's still giving me once again once again okay in schema",
  "giving me once again once again okay in schema function head back to your functions so apparently it looks like uh you have some error in the schema that you're using the we are structuring your tool scroll down slowly I have arguments okay and so uh you have script URL and you have arguments okay and it's a type of array item okay list of ARS all right and please show me your code for [Music] this something yeah yeah so see items so can you scroll back a little yes so this items actually it it",
  "back a little yes so this items actually it it defines so if it's an array right within this array you can have individual objects okay uh so this items is that individual item so if you have an array and then in that AR array you have some item then it will um so so you have an array right this this this item at Z2 index then this is item at this first index um and it's type is a string that makes sense okay I think that is correct uh can you scroll to the function once yes sir yeah the task",
  "scroll to the function once yes sir yeah the task from the function yeah just stop over here okay so it's taking the run and uh then the task oh okay so what you doing is that you are the function which is responsible to pass your uh query yes sir function which is responsible for passing your query and you know extra uh selecting the best function to run the best tool to use so you are passing those parameters in this function you have to create another function for that specific task okay sir",
  "another function for that specific task okay sir so sir I have to create uh another function with another name yeah yeah yeah because uh if you remember that I had one question named quy GPT and that question that uh function was responsible for taking your entire query which you have passed on to your in your uh in your end point and then it just passed that entire text and selected the best parameter best function to use sir but uh when the in the session when sir run it uh it was working uh",
  "the session when sir run it uh it was working uh I have actually uh take the code from that only so I did I don't think so he has written another function for that what I would have WR written another function but I think this this this error that you're getting all right so this is from GPT okay so basically I think this is some problem with the Json schema okay sir um can you scroll a bit up yes sir yeah I think this is problem somewhere over here and can you show the error in post man yes",
  "here and can you show the error in post man yes sir so this is added from GPT because it contains monthly coost and then monthly request and this is the error invalid schema for function task Runner script URL argument arguments is not of type object comma bullion okay and can you go back there so argument should be bullan yeah I'm not able to spot the error but error is within this schema yeah yeah so what I was saying is that can you scroll down s so the end point uh the slash endpoint which",
  "s so the end point uh the slash endpoint which is responsible for taking her queries she's passing uh that as a tool oh yeah yeah yeah that that is correct I mean that is another mistake I mean so that that happens when you are actually calling that function uhuh but but we are not calling the function so tools is tools right should a list sir I think uh can you scroll a bit up sh that is not the problem like task Runner we are ex actually not running that function okay we are just calling it",
  "running that function okay we are just calling it so this is a function that is available in the python script but we haven't executed that function so that is not a problem maybe can can you try additional prop also fall should be there and some few other stuff I think uh additional properties and these things is it I think I'm not sure I it's very uh verbos like this Json schema like you can just copy this and just go to Json schema validator or something online and check if it first",
  "or something online and check if it first validates it and then yes but then you have to tell her to do it so that will be le um so arguments is this thing and then properties is this [Music] thing okay one thing you can do like just change this items uh remove this type as a string bullion why it is accept expecting a bull I don't know uh okay make it object and now put is comma and enter and uh create a key ergs create one key AR GS AR G yes yeah yes and and put it inside quotes and yeah it",
  "yeah yes and and put it inside quotes and yeah it should be a dictionary kind of object oh yeah put yeah yeah and now type yes yes just press tab okay uh now try to execute it yes sir e so it is showing uh error in script URL arguments is not type of object um uh there is some problem with the Jon schema can you copy this schema just copy from line number till 51 and okay copy it and open one chat GPT window and over here paste it and now get the error from postmen and District it below it uh",
  "error from postmen and District it below it uh tools of zero invalid parameter yeah send it it seems like there was an issue with the scheme for the function you're trying to with the structure of the arguments based on the error it looks like the argument list should be defined as an array of object but the definition seems to be incorrect here is the corrected version can you scroll and keep it scrolling um yeah keep it scrolling okay arguments is now corrected def AR it was not valid in the",
  "is now corrected def AR it was not valid in the okay just copy this code and stick it in please of your J schema uh can you go back there um okay scroll a bit up I think it is tool andore choice or something just scroll bit down I think it is tool and underscore Choice instead of tools underscore Choice should be tool yeah and oh it's just tools tools is tools and then required yeah okay and tools and record choice right yes okay tool Choice tool choice uh I think I think in the first terminal",
  "choice uh I think I think in the first terminal you are running one application so over here you have two terminals right yeah just stop it and run it again so now it's working yes sir now it's working thank you sir should I stop present sure [Music] sure all right uh I know uh yes sir I just wanted to ask that here JRA sir was using his internal storage uh for uh taking up the file and writing a script in internal storage itself so I was just I'm not aware that how should I write my code so",
  "I'm not aware that how should I write my code so that uh when you guys check it it will work like I am also doing uh right now in my internal storage so what do I replace in that in place of that yeah yeah so just install it in Docker okay and don't hide qu it so just either use function calling or you make your prompt robust okay and that way you can get uh the installation code from GPT so just do it in talker okay okay sir and what about those files which uh the llm is going to uh use like",
  "files which uh the llm is going to uh use like so we have to edit those manually or like our Cod will be like that only do we have to mention those uh piece of uh text files or images in the code itself or how that thing I am unable to do uh like like you're you're talking about the code that is generated by our script like llm code. PI right uh yes that also and the things which uh llm needs to do like dates is there and uh some images is there now in data uh folder which has generated yeah so",
  "now in data uh folder which has generated yeah so what do we need to do with that do we have to write a script for uh uh changing those only or will it be a script for generalizing all the other things uh [Music] so in in task B so if there are 10 tasks in B section right so those tasks you don't have some a description about them right so it should be generic enough to pass those tasks so use combination of function calling and then self-writing code and I I I would prefer to have a good",
  "code and I I I would prefer to have a good prompt that requires less code but having a good prompt will help a lot uh yes Mahesh yeah uh one basic uh query related to dependen is okay whatever you added at the beginning of the file with using script okay so I tried with that and whenever I running image once I create a image then it tells me that modu not found whatever dependencies I added with using script okay are you using UV yes okay okay can you share your screen sure able to see my",
  "can you share your screen sure able to see my screen uh yes it is visible okay so these are the dependencies I added and uh Docker file I added command UV run the application name okay okay MH created image okay okay and when I'm running withman command this is the I getting this model not found um okay can you show ABP or whatever the name of your um it is toask Epi uh fast API is the D in TN c i s requires Python and then fast API is the uh can you show your Docker file sure and it is setting",
  "you show your Docker file sure and it is setting up the permissions then you're copying that file to there and then you're just running it [Music] and okay one one thing I want to ask you are you able to execute this particular a task api. p in your local system yeah I was able to run it earlier uh because uh this particular uh script related I I added afterwards before that I used pip to install fast AP and request like so I was able to run on my Lo requirement txt we can do using requirements",
  "Lo requirement txt we can do using requirements there like copy requirements and then run run P install requirements yes yes that is also possible uh but why this U is not r yes you can just go to your Docker image first go inside the root interactive shell and go inside bin bash and then try UV run the script there first you try to do it from there first are you in the dock image you saying that exe it hyphen it then that image this thing like whatever that no that yeah that's yeah oh that is",
  "whatever that no that yeah that's yeah oh that is image ID we need container ID Oh that's oh yeah myad uh just do uh podman PS that will show container IDs no I can't see oh that means you don't have container running right now okay do failing at run itself right whenever I'm trying to run that it's failing with this one okay I the image was created four hours ago do we need to create it again after the code change because there's a Code change that has happened yes yes that you have to do no",
  "that has happened yes yes that you have to do no this particular code change I did at that time only when four hours back yeah four hours back only okay okay okay can can you do one thing M uh go to there and do pman PS hyphen and okay um now you have these things all right now you do podman start and 1 F4 this one yeah this one okay uh now do pman PS okay this container is not again running you trying to run container it's not running just try rebuilding the container with the new image you",
  "rebuilding the container with the new image you are saying that cre a image yeah yeah just rebuild it it only takes a minute right weild in Contin okay the image name is 79 sorry I think okay try running the application in your u in your P code itself I mean as in on your regular terminal okay there is one difference this terminal is actually in your C drive the other one is in your WSL I think right uh yes ah this is the difference this application is not the same application in both places",
  "is not the same application in both places what does it what does it mean yeah I have mounted right so it is the same project is it yeah okay just check make sure yeah it's the same thing yes it doesn't look like the same file simple only yeah oh what were those special characters which one is it problem of of spatial characters yeah there a I can see some yeah might be this uni code versus uh what is it called Fancy some 1251 or something U maybe because of the ID that he's using right which",
  "because of the ID that he's using right which ID is he using I sh PC python sha I yeah I mean there are unusual characters in your okay I will I will try that might be part of the reason that the it's utf8 carriage return it's down in the taskbar we can see okay I will I will try by creating a file which will which will not have special characters and try to run it again you can also actually you can also build the image so rather than from WSL you could also build the image in Windows itself",
  "you could also build the image in Windows itself right yeah you could try and see if it makes a difference I'm not sure it's a very unusual problem you can do one thing you can also send the file to J okay and we will we will try and build the image here and see what happens sure because that's very unusual as your file runs obviously so why is he not building I will try once and if did not work I will sh send it to J thank you uh yes talin yeah I am facing one issue in so whenever I try to",
  "I am facing one issue in so whenever I try to generate any python code I am not able to direct the python to have the absolute PA con it's directly taking whatever it's being given like SL data SL the f okay where are you trying to do like I am trying to run in local as well as like container so okay like if you are running it inside container then don't try to change it okay just keep it data folder uh so why I'm saying it is because in the prompt it will say the this is input file so either",
  "it will say the this is input file so either you will have to if you use function calling approach then actually you can um edit the file path but if llm is generating code then you won't be able to edit the file path or else you will have to explicitly tell llm that I have this data folder inside this particular path okay this is what you have to tell to LM so and then it might even do mistakes so better to keep it in the data folder itself okay so don't try to change it in a Docker and",
  "okay so don't try to change it in a Docker and regarding machine so just make your prompt a little better it will work okay I have tried this question yeah because I am facing that issue can you like you told in the beginning of session but I could not understand that one okay can you share your screen my laptop will hand um yeah I can share I will try to join you and so uh telin I have pasted the command in the uh comment section as well okay so you can change the email address there and then",
  "you can change the email address there and then directory where you want to get the data okay no this is working I'm asking in the main thing main prompting we have to generate from script right for running the task yes yes yes so let me share the screen [Music] umin yeah I won't be your voice is going back to me okay uh so I won't be able to exactly help with a because I think you you will be able to do it by some changes in prompt or you can use uh function calling approach so that is part of",
  "uh function calling approach so that is part of even so I won't be able to help with that okay does anyone else have any doubt or else will end the session I am able to do the correctly theing isar me",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/1UbY1R4lrFk =====",
  "G 5 where is the recording going okay I guess the recording is up and let's get started so this entire week is about you know data pre processing and cleaning up of the data and that's what we are going to do in this particular session so firstly it is the question is about data cleaning in Excel okay and I would I would assume that it's going to be uh you know it's a really simple task to do uh so you have simply been given an Excel file I will just download it once and open it and just show",
  "just download it once and open it and just show you few functions should I download it once again download it once again uh let's all right so what you have to do in this entire question is that you have to clean up the column and calculate the total margin so this is the formula for total margin which has which has to be used in this uh regarding this data and before applying this formula we have to apply some filters and before applying these filters we have to actually create the data these",
  "filters we have to actually create the data these columns right so the first thing that we have been told to do is that uh uh we have to you know we have to see that these are our sales and cost columns okay and the total margin requires the total sales and the total cost right so we have to we know that we have to sum these two columns in some way but we also have to apply these filters okay so the first filter which it talks about it's the time filter okay and as you can see that it says that",
  "filter okay and as you can see that it says that all the sales that are occur up to and including the specific date which is of 8th of mar 8th of May 2023 so all these have to be included in this time pram so for that we have to look into the date column on okay so this is the date column as and as you can see that uh also which is mentioned over here is that the date column contains dates in two types which are mm DD y y and YY y/ mm/ D okay so these are the two format in which your dates are",
  "these are the two format in which your dates are available and one thing which you will notice is that so if you guys have been trying to solve this particular question and you might have used chat GPT or perhaps you already had this knowledge about Excel that there is a function called Date value okay and the entire uh function of this particular method is that it converts a date in text to the date format okay so uh this is a date value function and uh we just have to enter the text value",
  "and uh we just have to enter the text value okay so it's pretty simple I will just enter it and let's see if I get the Des okay so I am getting something but I can see that there are few value errors which I'm able to see and few numerical values so for these numerical values uh it's pretty simple so actually date is stored in numerical values in in system okay in computers date is has been you know it's stored in numerical values and then you can actually convert it to dat time format and why",
  "actually convert it to dat time format and why is it that why are you able to see this uh 4, 45,1 94 why is it that because this is actually the number of days that has passed from nine from there was specific date I am not able to remember that I guess it was 1st of Jan 199 okay it was I guess 1 of Jan 1990 and this was the exact date from which it is referencing this particular date and it's able to calculate the number of days which have passed okay done okay so it's a pretty simple process",
  "okay done okay so it's a pretty simple process that you have to do that uh now to convert these numbers into you know dates which we usually are accustomed to see just simply select this entire column and select this uh short dat and you can see that this has converted this entire date into a reasonably uh you know a certain format which we are familiar with but the thing is that we have value errors okay and those value errors occur only in the dates which have iph between right and why is",
  "the dates which have iph between right and why is this value ER can anyone just tell me this can you guys tell me why am I able to see this value error over here because as you can see that this date is you know it's being perfectly uh converted to a date time format but this date there is something wrong with this one what's wrong with this and anyone just open their mic and tell me it's a month 17 month exactly so the difference between these two days is that actually the month is over here",
  "two days is that actually the month is over here okay the month is over here and the date is over here and what this date value function does is it's able to read this that okay so what it does is it by default takes into account that okay so this is the date and this should be the month okay and it's able to read it okay so it is third of December 2022 but actually it is 12th of March 2022 and uh when it's able to when you know when the when the when the number of day is between 1 to 20 1 to",
  "when the number of day is between 1 to 20 1 to 12 it's able to convert it into that format but whenever the date exceeds 12 it's you that so the problem is that whenever we are having this these hyphens over here it's converting the data wrong okay it's converting the date into DD actually it's assuming that the date is in DD mm y but actually the high fund dates are in mm DD and Y okay so this is the error it is making and for that we have to write an entire Excel function okay let's try to",
  "write an entire Excel function okay let's try to debug this yeah yeah sir I'm not getting any error I am doing like this only are you using date value function yes I am using date value function then perhaps congratulations uh you might have no such date which have the month section of it it has 10 0 yes sir uh well we can you know we can look into it after when I'm finished with this okay the doubt okay I want to ask one thing like using this approach like uh can't we use pandas yeah we can",
  "approach like uh can't we use pandas yeah we can use FAS that's AB you just Co it right actually you can just Co it can just pass it out but the thing is that we can use Spas but the thing is that I wanted to show this entire thing in Excel and yeah go ahead okay yeah so how you can do this entire thing Exel and obviously the question is about Excel cleaning up your data in Excel so you know how can I just go ahead with pandas instead right so how you can actually you know debug this error so",
  "how you can actually you know debug this error so the thing is that whenever we will be going to have hyund functions what we're going to do we are going to separate it out okay and for that uh okay for that uh yeah we have to find a hon okay first and foremost I'll be finding that there should be a hyphen in this entire text okay few arguments so this is the find function which is able to find a certain subring in this entire spring okay also I have to do this here which is fine and this is",
  "I have to do this here which is fine and this is The Hyphen function so the hyph substring within this text and you be able to okay so this has this something should be D3 and okay so this fine function is able to return me that okay there is something there is a hyen in this entire dat text okay so now what we can do is to identify if the date because this function is just giving me the place where this hyph is present right now how can I classify how can I you know uh kind of create it like",
  "how can I you know uh kind of create it like uh a yes no category okay so how can I create a fun how can I create a condition out of it because it's just it's just giving me a three it's just giving me the position of that certain Ione so what we can do is we can use the is number function okay so uh I just create a new column that's much better to understand okay so I'll be using an is number function which is when it's being paused with a number it's going to return it true right but if",
  "number it's going to return it true right but if you're going to pass a string or let's say any other thing into it let's say I'm going to write Sange right so when you're going to pass a string or any or uh an element of any other data type it's going to return the false okay and that's going to be our key to solve this problem right so what we going to do is I'm going to enclose this entire thing in an is number function and that is how I will get true or false over here okay just you can",
  "get true or false over here okay just you can just see that I just added this number and it's giving me a true but it's giving me a false over here because it's actually trying to find out if it is a number or not actually it's a Boolean value okay so we can just clear this there okay that's just okay so it's getting made through now when we have a true when we have a value which is giving me something like true what can I do to actually create a you know condition kind of can anyone just tell",
  "a you know condition kind of can anyone just tell me what should I do so if it's true then don't not pass if it's false then pass using date value exactly exactly if we are able to find this hyph in it then we have to uh not pass it we have to actually do something else and if we are able to find it then well and good that's pretty fine okay before I get into that what we are actually going to uh how we are actually going to use this is number function I want to show you how you can convert",
  "function I want to show you how you can convert this date this this particular date in the right format okay and for that let's just convert this particular because all these hyund dates are being you know converted wrongfully but I'll be showing you how you can convert this date using this one because you know it's giving you it's giving me a value error right so how I can do this it's pretty simple first and foremost you have to use the uh subst stringing function so I don't know the exact",
  "stringing function so I don't know the exact name for the exact class in which these functions lie but uh I will call them subst stringing functions right so left function it just you just give it the text and the number of characters you want to you know get out of it and let's say if I give it a five what we do is it will give me the first five characters out of this text okay and if I and if I change it to a right it's going to it's going to give me the last five characters from the right",
  "give me the last five characters from the right okay so this is how the these functions work and there's also a mid function as well and what does this mid function do it just you have to give the text then you have to get the number the starting position which is which it needs to start with and then you have to get the give the number of characters so can anyone tell me how can I fetch out this 17 out of it out of this particular date using this mid function can anyone tell me also you can",
  "this mid function can anyone tell me also you can just see that it's giving you the key the that first of all you have to pass the text then the starting number and then the number of characters uh anuda mukarji has given me a formula let's just copy and paste and let's see if it works or uh okay so she has given me f and I have to get absolutely right thank youa so this is how you actually stracted out 17 out of this text okay and what we did was we simply uh entered this start number",
  "we did was we simply uh entered this start number parameter as four because we have have to start it with the fourth digit okay we have to start with the fourth character in this spring which is one and then we pass the number of characters we B out of it which was two and two includes one and seven that's why it's giving me 17 Now can anyone tell me using all these three functions how can I generate a Cas so firstly tell first and foremost just tell me how can I extract the ear part of this",
  "tell me how can I extract the ear part of this date anyone also an you can open up your mic and uh just you speak it out yeah yeah just uh typing it in the chat two second I think this should be this should work okay uh let's give it a try so uh an which is which one is the one to extract out the year the the one at the end right F7 at the end all right yeah let's give it a try and I'll be changing this because I have nothing over here and this should work okay it's able to extract the ear out",
  "should work okay it's able to extract the ear out of it now I want uh someone else to tell me not anuda now I want someone else to tell me how I can ex the Month part of the date anyone just open up their mic and speak it up and even if you get it wrong we won't be penalizing you in any shape or form right if you get it wrong then we will then we can actually get you to understand how your answer was wrong just open up your mic and participate guys that's what will make this discussion really",
  "guys that's what will make this discussion really you know fruitful a like of okay so uh nilima has given me a function let's just copy it and nma this function is for what can you open up your mic 12 12 okay and 12 was the Month part right and that's very good and now how can I extract the date part anyone except these two guyss just give me the code for that anyone uh anyone by the way uh that's actually done so that's already done yeah that's what I was yeah that's already done so all right",
  "what I was yeah that's already done so all right I just I didn't see that okay it's my bad so we have got the entire we have got all the three components of the date we require right now how can you reconstruct the entire date for that we will be using the date function the dates function and you can see what it all requires so it is it requires a year we definitely have the year then it requires the month we have the month as well and then it requires the day simply pass these three parameters",
  "the day simply pass these three parameters and it will give you the currect date okay and can you see that this is different from this one right so this is how you're going to solve this entire problem and uh what I will do is I will paste this is num function so I'm going to go really quick about this and uh then I ask you guys what's going what's happening okay so it's see it and one and then the year will be should be D2 and then it will be left d22 then it would be net d242 that's done the",
  "d22 then it would be net d242 that's done the date one is done all right and next what we will be doing passing the date value function for all the nony ones require okay so my back so actually have been passing these uh things in the is num function so we have to create an if statement and this should work absolutely it's working yeah we have got okay we have got it so can anyone tell me what I actually did how I actually created this entire function these entire uh I get the real value so",
  "function these entire uh I get the real value so this is the function which I used I try to magnify it even more but I don't think it would be okay so guys just tell me how I actually solve this particular problem I just combined the things which I actually did and then I able to get the answer so just tell me what is the last piece of the puzzle I have just put and it's working perfectly just tell me that anyway just open up them guys make it's past anyone who who is able to explain me what's",
  "past anyone who who is able to explain me what's happening over here well I guess not all right so we have simply passed this entire thing in an IF function and then we are able to uh then we are giving it uh so if it's able to find The Hyphen then we will be using this date function otherwise if it's a slash if it if it's using that slash date format then we'll be passing it to a date value function okay that's pretty simple and uh the next bits of this entire exercise are very simple so uh",
  "of this entire exercise are very simple so uh what I actually used to do is just past these exact values edit this column convert this entire column to a short date format and that's pretty much done next what you have to do you have to just head back to the yeah so next what you have to do you have to actually get that Delta values from there so that's pretty simple I'm not going to tell you guys how to do this because that can be simply done using the uh text to column function text to column",
  "the uh text to column function text to column option right here okay that's pretty simple I will tell you how you can actually remove these spaces so if you guys can see that we have multiple spaces in these uh you know in these currency Valu so that's pretty simple use a trim function it's going to remove sorry it's going to remove the extra spaces around this entire thing okay and then how can you actually separate these USD and the currency that's up to you right so I won't be getting into",
  "that's up to you right so I won't be getting into the deps of it because that's basic ex okay so anyone having any doubts anyone guys do you have any doubts by the way am I Audible yes sir you are audible all right so any doubts anyone or should we move ahead with the next question yeah I tried to do it while with you and getting an error I'm pretty sure it's some bracket error or something but yeah I should I will just copy this one let's try it try Okay because why not okay so I okay so the",
  "it try Okay because why not okay so I okay so the thing is that the thing is that the only that only error you are making is that if you find this hyphen then you are actually passing the date value oh it should be opposite yeah exactly it should be opposite and then it will okay so let's move ahead to the next question if no one has any doubts so for me uh yeah please sh can I share my screen okay yeah please share so this thing I applied date value function all the functions get converted",
  "value function all the functions get converted into SL into slash one okay that's so myre Google Sheets Vance no sir it's Excel Exel I guess it would be an advanced version of excel which is able to pass through everything that's pretty good okay and it's let me just have a look it's able to get the uh it is 1019 it is taking month as yeah there is there is an ER in this yeah it should be the 2nd of June over here so uh the slashed ones that your hyphen ones are perfect I guess yes yes yes yeah",
  "hyphen ones are perfect I guess yes yes yes yeah yeah they per no they're not yeah your slash ones are perfect oh sorry your hyph ones are perf perfect but your slash ones are not so you have the opposite ones are also not perfect uh see E6 it's 10 19 2022 actually I guess that your date value function is converting them to mmdd y y y y okay for all yeah it's converting it to mm D in my case it was DDM y right so you have a problem with this slash once and you can Rectify it okay that it",
  "slash once and you can Rectify it okay that it follows the exact same format okay thank you right you can stop sharing now yes sir is my screen visible yes sir all right so let's move ahead to the next question and uh we have this uh and as you guys can see that even I was struggling with this entire question uh so uh I would say that uh what we can do okay let's just go go ahead with this one all right so I'll be naming it Sho to and if I'm not wrong this entire thing is about you know",
  "I'm not wrong this entire thing is about you know changing everything in the vs code editor itself let me open the vs codor yeah so here's the Q2 this is not the Q2 Q2 ref download yeah it was Q2 all right so uh so this is the entire data file we have given okay I just try to magy it all right okay so this is the entire uh file we have been given by the way guys I am able to see that only nine of you are present over here excluding me and Ja there are only seven people present over so I would",
  "are only seven people present over so I would really you know urge you guys to uh encourage your friends to and uh you know your coursemates to go ahead and just join these live sessions because you know whenever uh we give projects like that one that just went by and uh then they regret not joining these live session and actually learning something good so I Ur you guys to you know just go ahead and encourage your coursemates or your friends otherwise uh it's really good to have you guys over",
  "uh it's really good to have you guys over here okay all right so uh what we do is that we have to fetch out these IDs out of the out of this entire you know mess that we have been given Let's uh let's be real this is the entire mess that we have been given so uh what I what I will do is that I will firstly try to remove the Extra Spaces and for that it's pretty simple just select what you want to replace change all occurrences and I will replace it by single space okay and then what I will do",
  "it by single space okay and then what I will do is I will just replace this space and dash with a uh let's let's say only a dash okay so these are few changes that you have to make on your own you have to look into the file and actually uh make these changes okay so this is another one the another one would be these uh double colons simply change it to a dash right and then we we are going to face the problem of space Dash again simply change it to aach okay and I guess it's pretty much done",
  "it to aach okay and I guess it's pretty much done what else we can do is we can remove these marks because we have nothing to do with the marks at the moment right so I will just copy this marks change all occurrences yeah change all occurrences and I will uh REM remove everything after it and how did it just control shift and right arrow key okay and it will just remove everything after that simply press delete and let's hope yeah it works okay so all the marks are gone and the only thing that",
  "so all the marks are gone and the only thing that we are left with are the names and the IDS okay next thing that I will do is that I will remove these extra and these extra new line characters simply select these change all occurrences and press delete uh this should work yeah it works perfectly next what I'm going to do is I will be removing these extra space characters extra new this this entire space character and the thing is that you will be wondering that why uh I'm doing it like this",
  "be wondering that why uh I'm doing it like this the only reason is that because if I select a space let's say it's going to select every space over here okay and to and I don't want to remove every space over there right so for that what I will do is I will select these this thing change all occurrences and it's going to select only those particular uh places when we have a new line character and then we have a space okay now I press delete it's going to be like this I'll press enter and it's",
  "going to be like this I'll press enter and it's again back to the new line okay again we are facing with this one and let's change all so this is the this is a process that you have to you know do manually and you can actually you know do it really quickly in this way because if you are going to let's say if I'm going to Python and then I'm trying to figure it out how to get how to get the entire thing out of it so it's not going to work the only reason being there's a lot of ambiguity in this",
  "reason being there's a lot of ambiguity in this entire thing okay in this entire mess because some where you have dashes and then space then where you have space and dashes so that's a really big mess and that's python is going to have a really bad time solving okay you can pass this entire thing to an lln that's one thing to do but the thing is that this entire uh file is about 10 10,000 lines okay so you have 10,000 uh uh people and their data so I really doubt that an llm will be able to you",
  "so I really doubt that an llm will be able to you know pass through all these lines in that sense okay so uh I'll replace these as well and whenever we have this I will delete it and yeah it will work it and then as you can see that we have few names which have a hyph as well okay so there's a name which have a hyphen uh yeah there are few names which have a hyph and then we have Dash as well so uh after this I don't think that anything much is remaining what I will do is just simply save it",
  "remaining what I will do is just simply save it okay now I will head back to Google and uh I will open a txg to CSV converter because uh the thing is that you can actually convert it in your file explorer as well but that's not recommended because you know some kind of encoding errors are always there okay so my uh Q2 Q2 txt is saved now I will just have to drag it to text converter convert it please it's converting wait it's a large file obviously it's going to take a bit more time than",
  "obviously it's going to take a bit more time than [Music] expected by the way guys do you have any problems regarding this one this entire thing which I did any problems regarding it any doubts yeah yes sir sir how you remove the marks part for the marks part the thing is that let's say I have a marks over here okay I have marks over here then I Mark then marks it has opened it let's head back to okay I have marks like this as well okay and then we have the marks and uh here the let's see the",
  "we have the marks and uh here the let's see the marks over here is like this so what I did was it was pretty simple I just selected the so it was marks marks okay I just selected this part because if I am going to select this entire thing then it won't be able to you know if I just click onon be able to get the uper one as well okay so for this just simply simply select this Marks One CH occurences so you can see that we have got a cursor a multic cursor over here right what you can do to also",
  "cursor over here right what you can do to also trunade so what you can do is just simply press delete and then that marks will just go but we also want to truncate these marks these numerical values as well so for that what I did was simply I selected this so it's marks the S as well okay change all ACR is now what I did was carefully control shift and right arrow ke okay so control shift and right arrow key is going to select everything that's to that's to right of right of the where your",
  "to that's to right of right of the where your cursor is simply press and it's and one more thing sir sir you have removed spaces in the starting but for me when I doing this it is selecting all the spaces in the entire text yeah so you you never you never have to remove all the spaces you never have to select a space so I never deleted a space actually so if I just change all occurrences and you can see that all the space are intact what I did replace was I replace the double spaces yes so I",
  "replace was I replace the double spaces yes so I replace the double spaces with a single space okay okay okay okay okay okay thank you sir yeah yeah so now you have the CSV file and uh what I will do is do this data in not filter uh to remove a yeah that's two columns delimer is going to be attach and finish and we can see that we have got these two columns actually three columns because we have few uh IDs over here as because few people had dashes in their names so it has given me like this so",
  "in their names so it has given me like this so what I can do is simply you know uh if I will run an if statement if this particular cell have nothing if this particular cell has nothing then simply give me this value and if it actually has something then you have to return me the C1 value okay just simply uh okay all right so actually have to drag it down entirely which is not feasible so if I just drag it to a few places you're going to see that it's going to give me all these IDs okay so we",
  "it's going to give me all these IDs okay so we have extracted the IDS out of that entire mess and now what you can do is simply you know select this entire thing remove duplicates and then it will remove the duplicates it has expanded the selection that's not that was not intended continue with the color yeah and go so it has removed some duplicate values has remove 439 duplicate values and only3 remain so actually that's not the correct answer because I have not selected each and everything",
  "because I have not selected each and everything okay so you have to do it for the entire problem okay so that's how you solve this problem any doubts or should we move ahead I guess no doubts that's pretty good okay uh all right so I guess all of you are familiar with the multi multic functionality which I just ched is it that okay can anyone tell me just open up your mic and can anyone tell me how can I delete everything after a slash anyone just open up their mic and tell me how can I remove",
  "open up their mic and tell me how can I remove this entire part after the slash um so control F slash then for me it's option yeah contrl F and slash all right and for me it's uh option enter I don't know the windows equivalent okay so Mac yeah okay so I think Alt Enter Alt Enter just a second alt and enter all right so that's that's a shortcut which I actually learned from you okay yeah and then just click the left key and then shift control shift right and then yeah or just control shift",
  "shift right and then yeah or just control shift right control shift right control shift right and then control shift and right and back and then was not able to get the entire thing yeah and then you can iterate I mean you can iterate after this again and do another no I just want to delete everything in this one okay do control shift right again and let's see what happen Okay so it has gone yeah that that breaks that breaks yeah it doesn't work yeah yeah so how can I yeah yeah okay so I will",
  "yeah yeah so how can I yeah yeah okay so I will just how yeah yeah so for that simply select it okay all occurrences and this time you have to press function shift and then right okay what does function do so the difference between control shift and function shift is that control shift if I just if you just go to your and you know just press the control key and then right arrow then it's going to jump to the next place which have a space next yeah next word right exactly if I just go to this",
  "yeah next word right exactly if I just go to this Kathy at the very beginning of Kathy and if I press down control and then right it's going to jump to the next words okay but what happens with function if you press down function and press let's say let's head back to Kathy and I want to move to the very right of very last of this entire line so how you can do is just simply press down function and then the right and it's going to just quickly to take you to the right end of this entire line",
  "to take you to the right end of this entire line okay so that's how you are actually going to solve this problem okay simply change all occurrences function shift and right it's going to select the entire right part and just press enter okay and now you have all the names okay so that was a Min exercise and you know it's really fun to interact with you guys if you just uh thank you for opening up your mic and just interacting with me okay you guys uh got to learn something new okay so uh that",
  "uh got to learn something new okay so uh that concludes the question to part any more questions or should we move ahead what is this this is shell all right any more questions guys or should we move ahead I guess we should move ahead no if you guys have no other questions all right so let's uh the next question is actually here you have to use uh you know Unix tools okay Unix tools are python regular expression so that's up to you but I'm going to demonstrate using Unix tools okay and uh I'm",
  "to demonstrate using Unix tools okay and uh I'm pretty sure that by now you you guys are you guys must have downloaded in some way or other you must have got your hands on WSM or a BMW because the thing is the project actually you know forces you to download these stuffs and in fact the GS also forces you okay okay so I have this ZIP file already what I have to do is simply go to the folder and I'm going to extract it exract to this one let create a new folder all right so I'll uh let's delete",
  "a new folder all right so I'll uh let's delete this Del and what I'm going to do is I'm going to rename this to Q3 so that that's really you know it's going to help me not going to write actually the entire thing okay so let's type in clear right so we got a clear terminal and we are in Q3 at press lsnc okay so in this folder we have this data file all right if I just open this data file in my PS code by the way guys is this level of magnification enough for you or should I magnify it even more",
  "enough for you or should I magnify it even more guys so it's enough all right so this is the data file which we get in our uh uh from the downloaded zip folder now we are going to actually fetch out a certain pattern okay if I go to the question once this one it is my question this is not [Music] uh I just okay all right so the question is that you have to find the number of successful get requests for a page under slada Slash from uh this particular date from this particular time which is 2",
  "date from this particular time which is 2 p.m. to uh I guess this is uh 10 p.m. if I'm not wrong to 2: p.m. from 10 p.m. from 2: p.m. to 10 on Wess days okay so you have to actually when you just give it give this entire FAL look you can see that each and every line has something to offer okay and what we are going to look into this is that we have to find all the get requests okay so we have a get return over here okay we have get which are successful okay the number of successful get requests",
  "okay the number of successful get requests right not all get not all get requests only the successful ones so how can you actually get to know which request is actually successful so can Ione tell me how can I uh just figure it out how a certain uh status status code yeah exactly status so what what should be the status yes thank you T uh and S you were trying to say something yes sir 200 status code exactly it should be 200 okay you can see that we have should it be between 200 and 300 exactly",
  "we have should it be between 200 and 300 exactly it should be between 200 and 299 actually yeah exactly just yeah just from 300 we start with some other kind of code I'm not actually sure about which one okay so uh we have to find where we are going to find the 200 ones right moreover we have to find where the where this certain slash Canada has been used okay so can anyone tell me where this slash Canada where can I find this SL anyone um after the get yeah exactly after the get after the get",
  "the get yeah exactly after the get after the get we have the we trying to fetch right and you can see that we we have SL so I guess you guys some of you might have got SLO as well for my case it's SL Canada okay so uh we have to get the get requests which are successful have Canada between this to this on Wellness days okay that's another filter that you have to apply and and I will tell you how you can actually you know just simplify this out okay so what we're going to do is we are going to",
  "okay so what we're going to do is we are going to run a GP command Okay so GP is a Unix tool which is used to identify patterns in your data okay and if I pass a certain pattern to it it's going to fetch out the it's going to fetch out the uh lines which have that particular pattern okay so it should be the syntax of this should be gra then the pattern and then your file name okay this should be the entire syntax of your code of your actually command not code okay so it should be grap and then",
  "not code okay so it should be grap and then I'm going to write the expression the regular expression which is going to actually CCH through all these uh lines of code and F of pattern and for that it should be something like this just I'm going to just type it out and then I will be explaining you guys so this is dot do uh star and then it should be a get then they're going to again have some okay so I will just tell you so this dot is actually a single a single letter okay so this dot actually",
  "single a single letter okay so this dot actually represents a single letter but when you add add a ack after it it's actually an can say it's something like uh you know it's going to uh you know this particular thing this Dot and asate it means that there are multiple characters before get and there are multiple characters after get okay so this dot actually represents a single character and this as trick represents multip okay so it's going to kind of multiply that thing okay uh if for the",
  "to kind of multiply that thing okay uh if for the lack of better okay so dot so there is there are multiple characters before get then there multiple characters after get and then there should be slash Canada after it okay then we have multiple characters after it as well and it should be 200 we should get a 200 after it okay 200 status code and that's enough we are not going to consider these uh these three other filters we have to apply for the moment okay so this is one thing and we have to",
  "moment okay so this is one thing and we have to pass the name of the file which is data and you can see that it's going to give out all the files which have this particular thing this particular pattern which is get Canada and a status code of 200 okay and you can see all these uh all these lines which it has returned us it's giving us this particular code okay so let's say if I want to find the uh let's say if I want to find okay guys just tell me one thing if I want to find all the get",
  "tell me one thing if I want to find all the get requests which had a status Cote of 400 or yeah just 400 which have a status code of 400 and they were sent through Mozilla Firefox device can anyone tell me that how can I fetch it just open up your mic and uh just help me out okay so the to a level two again there is a level two filtering you can do uh on this pipe it out level two 200 yeah we we can we can definitely do that but the thing is or you can use said o actually like you can use any",
  "you can use said o actually like you can use any of the scripts or you can write a Python program or you can uh there are many ways of doing this exactly there are many ways to do this but uh yeah just as you just told us that we can use a python script as well but the thing is that I I want to I want to demonstrate this using uh these Unix tools and yes we can do we can do yeah and yes we can do it using pipe operators as well but the thing is that I'm not asking you to you know to fetch out",
  "that I'm not asking you to you know to fetch out that this entire things from these patterns which which it has finded out I'm asking you to fetch it out of all of these lines okay so if I uh I just mentioned that okay this is one level of filter and after that I want one more filter so then obviously we could we could have used a pipe operator but the thing is that I'm asking you to fet it from all these llies yeah anyone I attempted in the chat if you could have a look yeah sure so okay T has",
  "if you could have a look yeah sure so okay T has also given a code that's really good of you guys to participate okay so actually uh you also have to mention the name of the file okay so let's check yeah that Minor Detail I mean just want to thep yeah so what it is doing is that it's giving us the get then Canada okay so Canada was something which I didn't mention I only mentioned sorry about that yeah the get requests which have uh status quote of 400 and they were s using mosula all right so",
  "of 400 and they were s using mosula all right so this is is kind of correct but not exactly correct so T let's check your code as well your command and again and again I'm saying okay so you have you're asking to make a change all right let's change it to 400 and exactly we are going to get all the uh requests which okay so the thing is that uh uh it's actually giving us 200 let me check why okay so the thing is that it's actually you know patching out this 400 out of it okay so this is I guess",
  "out this 400 out of it okay so this is I guess uh kind of another level of code which I'm not aware about uh but what we can do is we can make some changes like this space and then space or let's check now and exactly now we are able to find all the requests which have a code of 400 okay so the difference the change which I made was so this is T's code what I simply did was I just added two spaces after this 400 because the thing is it was fetching all those lines which have you know 4,000 code",
  "all those lines which have you know 4,000 code okay and they actually had they were actually successful they were having 2,200 code status code so it was fetching another it was fetching that 400 from another code and that's was that was giving us the issue okay so I just simply added these spaces and uh we are able to get the right answer okay so this is how you solve that but let's head back to the uh particular portion we are looking at okay so I got the I got get and the canala one and I it",
  "I got the I got get and the canala one and I it successful and also make let's make sure so this is not the it should be like this okay and also uh yeah and also it should have a 200 sucess sucessful okay with a space let's enter and it's it's going on and on yeah we are able to get all these get with Canada and then the status code are 200 right now the thing that you have to do is you have to move it to a CSV file or Excel file okay and uh ra rather than an Excel file let's move it to a txt",
  "rather than an Excel file let's move it to a txt file okay because I am pretty sure that it's give it's if I if I'm going to you know just put all these files all these data into a uh into a CSP it's going to give me a compatibility show and I'm not going to know just dive into that mes okay so I will just create a new one which is data uh let's call it data gen uh you know you guys might have some you know some what we say some kind of deju of that datag gen and we'll make it pxt okay so what",
  "that datag gen and we'll make it pxt okay so what does this greater than operator do it just transfers the entire output which this command was giving us to this particular file which is detergent. dxg right let's go to detergent. dxt and we are able to find all these links over here good but the thing is that we also have to apply filters as well for that let's go back to Google so this is the open Define is another thing that we have to cover today so what I will do is ex to CSP converter",
  "today so what I will do is ex to CSP converter once again and uh it is yeah data gen converting switch so what I usually what what's my usual uh pipeline of working is I fetch out this entire thing from let's say I do a bit amount of uh these pattern matching using unix commands and then the things which require some numeric stuff like between this date or you know between this time and On Wellness days as well so for that I just you know just put on few filters in Unix that's that just get the",
  "on few filters in Unix that's that just get the entire out of entire output out of that and put it to a CSV file okay uh so this is data G CSV save let open it so it's two MB file pretty thck all right so we have this entire file with all right what I'm going to do is I want this part okay let's just magnify it I want this part right I have so all these lines have those three filters about Canada get and successful request now we have to apply another filters which are these okay the date one",
  "another filters which are these okay the date one the we have to apply uh we have to get to know about the day from the date then we have to get to know the time right so for that what we are going to do is uh let's just see uh what we can do uh we can give it a text to column so by the way I haven't solved this question yet and and I'm solving it live in front of you okay so let's just solve it together let's go okay okay let's just head back okay my bad it should be like this okay next and",
  "okay my bad it should be like this okay next and finish okay it has all right so uh we don't need this part now we just need this one right now I will create create a new column over here and what we can do is we can do another text two columns this time I will be entering this one finish and yeah we have separated out the entire date out of that entire line okay now the only thing remains simply delete these two no need for you all right and now let's let's just head back to the question",
  "now let's let's just head back to the question that's asking us to uh from 2:00 p.m. to 10: p.m. all right so for that we have to separate out the to separate out the uh date as date and time as well can anyone tell me how can I do this anyone just tell me how can I separate out the DAT sorry what's the question my question is so so I have this date and time together I want to find out I want to separate out the date and then the time yeah there are three Fields here date time and then uh time",
  "are three Fields here date time and then uh time zone so I think it will separate out right there are functions for that yeah how can I do that yeah which functions I think is the question I mean yeah so I think uh maybe you can split colon but then that would uh make the time messed up another thing you could do is split by the year 2024 I'm pretty sure this 20123 or 2022 as well so you can do that twice um those are just two ideas of the top of my head but a very clean split I can't think of",
  "my head but a very clean split I can't think of directly right now you are very you are almost correct anuda and you actually gave the right answer to be honest the thing is that the only require the r okay we only require this 14 this R and 22 okay so even if we split it by a column it's going to let's just split it by a column and let's see what we have we have a column yeah finish there is all data okay let's just do one thing delete everything over here and next by column next finish okay",
  "over here and next by column next finish okay can you see this that we only needed a call we only need the r right also we needed the uh minutes as well but we have no use for these the seconds and the time zone right so we have the r let's just name this because why not it's state it's hour and it's minutes okay now what I can do is I have to convert it to okay so can tell me how can I convert this spring to a date time object we just did it a few moments a few yeah all right so okay it has",
  "a few moments a few yeah all right so okay it has given me an error H let's see a value using this formula is of wrong data type okay so I guess it has already converted it to a yeah it has already converted to a date time of no need for that what we have to do is we have to get that week of 30 okay we it returns numbers 1 to 7 identifying the day of the week of the DAT all right so let's just pass it and go ahead okay so it's giving me like this but I will convert it to a number all right so",
  "but I will convert it to a number all right so this is ging a three which means uh if it's okay we also have to specify the return time okay so if we just look over here so we have multiple options of returning so number one is Monday through Sunday which is 7 so I'll be selecting two over there because it's going to return me uh with the values with one with Monday will be one and Sunday will be seven so that's the best way to go ahead enter and and this value is two because this is going to",
  "and this value is two because this is going to be a Tuesday okay what I will do is I will give it a week day name and let's apply filters to it okay let's see if we have okay so we have multiple options over here and the third one is going to be wedness J right it's going to be Wes okay we have got uh 230 values out of 3,000 values so these are going to be vness days for us now we have to find the r and the r is going to start so let's apply number PS okay it's going to be uh okay so it should",
  "PS okay it's going to be uh okay so it should be it should be between it should be greater than or equal to 14 and it should be less than or equal to 22 got it and we have this data okay if I just copy this entire thing so this is best practice I would recommend you guys to whenever you you know get something I just do just copy it to another sheet because uh you know it prevents a mishap all right so that's done that's done and let's just convert it to to convert it like this this is done all",
  "it to to convert it like this this is done all right we have a this and then we have a this as well and okay so we have few values which should be uh B so this is so can you guys see this we have 22 over here okay so it says the question says that it should be before 22 0 so you actually have to apply a filter over the minutes value as well okay so 2 to 18 is it's not going to be here okay so that's wrong it should be 0 0 it should be you know this value should be less than uh 20 uh 22 0 so uh",
  "value should be less than uh 20 uh 22 0 so uh that's something which I will leave to you guys so uh and I will just conclude this question over here any questions regarding this uh no such question yeah anyone else any questions or should we move ahead all right so uh let's just move ahead and uh let's I'll probably drop off now but uh thank you so much wanted you can always watch the recording of the lecture yeah yeah I'll catch the rest on the recording thank you so all right all right so now",
  "recording thank you so all right all right so now that anuda has gone I want you guys to you know participate a lot more okay so because you know uh he was participating a fair bit and uh please participate okay so that's also giving us motivation for you know coning this entire session and uh it helps us a lot okay so let's go ahead with the fourth question which is Apache logs downloads okay and what we going to see is that it's pretty much the same thing that we did in the third question",
  "the same thing that we did in the third question okay so this is a repeat of third this is a repeat of the third pattern exactly it's it's just a repeat of that I'm just going to give it uh scan I just going to scan it once and if there is something which I can show you then I'm going to show you okay by the way I haven't solved these questions yet so I don't know what they contain okay so this is Q4 so basically I'm you know live solving in front of you guys uh has it downloaded or not yeah",
  "of you guys uh has it downloaded or not yeah it's okay I will extract it to this one yeah it's here and we have the data file all right let's head back to our uh Uber terminal our WSL okay and I will just CD back to that particular folder all right so we are here let's just LS and yeah we have the data file uh let's open that file in Fr of us all right so yeah I guess it's just pretty much the exact same thing uh let's just check the question so across all requests under cartic slash on this is",
  "across all requests under cartic slash on this is this date so I guess it is more easier than the previous one how many bytes is did the top IP address by volume of downloads downloaded okay so it requires the same amount of uh the same thing which is using a cryp command okay so it's going to be something like this and uh uh I will leave it to you guys to Sol okay any questions regarding this grip thing because now we will be moving ahead to open Define any questions regarding this maybe I",
  "open Define any questions regarding this maybe I suggest maybe if people use EGP it's even more better like we just abely EG is and all those yeah yeah yeah it's like this right yeah you can just type EGP EG yeah you can give as a minus E or yeah yeah this this way also works the other one is this way and the higher version of this is actually like uh you guys know RG RG is even more like rest in peace GP they call it because is outdated so harg is even more better and if you want higher levels",
  "is even more better and if you want higher levels you can have said and do you can write your own script if you want even higher levels you can go earlier days we used to use with the Pearl and all actually like U and then you came off with this multi-threaded thing but you have many levels of doing this so yeah there are many tools available yeah you can even use llm like how you guys absolutely you can use do the trick but the thing is that we have about two lakhs of data no but that is where",
  "have about two lakhs of data no but that is where the Deep learning kicks in right actually like if you have uh more than 100,000 records then deep learning is pretty good so you can you can have other ways yeah yeah we can you know actually send this data into B into batches to the llm and that will take time but uh yeah it can be for it is pretty fast it depends upon yeah yeah yeah there are other ways yeah as you said actually there are yeah it's it's good actually like the questions are",
  "it's it's good actually like the questions are good yeah yeah I guess you are having fun solving this question yeah okay so uh this question is pretty much the same and uh I won't be putting much time this okay so let's go to open refine and uh let's get along with this okay so this is a really interesting topic open refine uh because the thing is okay I won't be downloading this data I will be using data but of some other type actually just close all windows all right so open refine is a tool",
  "all windows all right so open refine is a tool which you can download from the website open Define and you can download the tool but the thing is that they don't have a GUI application okay and that's uh pretty saddening that they don't have a go Application the thing is that uh open refine uh whenever like let's say actually what I did was open refine requires you to run a command to get it start get uh it server started okay so that's something which is uh unexpected of software which which",
  "which is uh unexpected of software which which is used in multiple places nowadays but uh we have to deal with what we have okay so what I did was uh there was so can you guys see this open this man over here what I did was I created an EXC file which had a certain CMD command to run that open and I obviously have forgotten that CMD command by now and uh uh it runs that command and if I'm not wrong then I actually used the icon I also changed the icon of this particular thing and now whenever I",
  "icon of this particular thing and now whenever I just double click on it and it will run that CMD command and then it will start my server okay so uh let's get started with open open refine okay so open refine is a tool which is used to make your life easier with data okay so it's used for data preparation data cleaning data preprocessing for all these things open refin is us and the Very you know the very great thing the very best thing about open refine is that it actually gives you something",
  "refine is that it actually gives you something it actually uh incorporates uh some kind of you know uh it incorporates deep learning into its architecture and it's able to solve your problems with you okay so I will just open something I'll show you how it works okay so by the way I am going to open my uh BDM project data okay so uh the thing is that I created my BDM project so I used open Define to do a certain task in my BM project and then I was able to get it right so I'm going to import",
  "I was able to get it right so I'm going to import that particular data and I'm going to show you how what was the problem and and then how I solved it okay uh before that I will just open it in Excel and then show you that would be much more better so by the way I will be honest that TDs is a subject which actually helped me a lot in getting along with this BDM project so BDM project if you guys uh don't know it's claimed to be the kind of the hardcore boss of all the diploma projects okay so",
  "hardcore boss of all the diploma projects okay so students are actually dropping out of this entire degree because of that project and uh uh this project uh so I actually used DDS and I was able to complete this project within a month so usually it's uh the entire timeline of BDM project is about four months but I was able to complete it into in one month and thanks to PS uh that I was able to do multiple things which I may have taken a lot of time to do and I was able to do it and that's how I",
  "to do and I was able to do it and that's how I was able to complete it really fast okay so the data was something like this so it was a uh uh it was a handloom shop okay so they were selling uh products like table covers towels blankets cushion covers plastic mat something like all these kind of products which can be categorized into you know home decor and uh handloom okay so what I did was can you guys see this we have items like this okay so this was something which I actually had to",
  "so this was something which I actually had to manually type in uh so I actually didn't have this uh this entire data given to me in Excel format I actually had to type it out from used bills from the from the bill copy of the seller okay so I was pred with that and that was the only thing which I was able to get out of it and then I have to manually type each and everything and that this was the final product okay so we got table covers large table covers small okay then we have bed sheets",
  "table covers small okay then we have bed sheets small cushion cover sets Okay curtain 5 ft and if we just search we have multiple curtains okay we have C curtains of multiple types which are AC curtains curtains 9 ft curtain 7 5 ft all these types of different things okay we have a curtain gargery as well so garer in Hindi it's actually the carrot color okay so uh we have multi uh uh curtains of multiple types the thing is that when you are actually going to perform data analysis on this data",
  "going to perform data analysis on this data you are going to have multiple you are going to have uh you know you're going to be deal you'll be dealing with all these different types separately okay so if I'm going to calculate the sum of all the curtain five feet types then it's going to be pretty small number and and we have very few rows of this curtain 5 ft as well okay so if I just copy it once and put it into here and find find all let's say find all so only five cells have this only five",
  "find all so only five cells have this only five cells have curtain five so it's impractical to perform any data analysis on this data right so what I did was I decided to Club all the curtains together okay it can be AC curtain it can be curtain gaji it can be 5T 7 feet no matter what I just cled all the curtains together I CED all the blankets together all the plastic mats together all the door mats together all the table covers together okay and then I was able to actually uh get a pretty",
  "and then I was able to actually uh get a pretty good Insight out of it but the thing is that it's a really tedious task to you know get just change the names of all these things to one thing no why do you want to change it see like there are different ways of like you know TR there are at least 40 ways like um of doing looking at the data actually like either uh you change it that's one option or you can go there are many other ways of looking around it like one of the things is maybe okay so",
  "around it like one of the things is maybe okay so there's a tool like pandas if you use it just use a query language and then this is like uh just starts with right or maybe whatever the regular expression like one is a common denominator is the table right you can just group it by that and then just one liner that's all one liner you can get everything yeah that's definitely one manner andols yeah yeah you can use that but it again it's going to add one one more step in my data analysis right",
  "add one one more step in my data analysis right no actually like usually I don't use Excel because see Excel is like outdo like um you use pandas or something programming it's like where like you automate these steps like uh it's not just this this is just one step in a pipeline right so so this is what actually like if you look at from a management perspective you're looking at product categories right you're looking at the hierarchy uh and uh okay there are some management terms here but",
  "uh okay there are some management terms here but actually that's what you're analyzing here slicing and dicing so there is a way to approach it but uh one of the step in that pipeline is this actually like what you are suggesting so that you can put it as a part of panda step and then you can have many steps also and then arrange in a pipeline and then have few things in sequence few things in par and you can do that yeah well that can be done and that's definitely an a really good approach as",
  "that's definitely an a really good approach as well but I actually used open ref for them and that's what I'm going to demonstrate and definitely you can use multiple other tools so I could have one one one another thing can be just copy all these uh data so there are uh about 105 multiple others as well uh okay so this is just a small section of the data which I had so we have 105 data sets 105 rowes what we can do is we can simply copy them and S it to an LM and just ask it to classify into",
  "S it to an LM and just ask it to classify into several different types that's another way as well but uh uh I used this one for go so uh I guess it's been loaded yeah it's loaded and there it is okay so uh I'm I have to should be yeah this one okay and then uh actually we have to create a project creating a project out of it good it's done uh we have to create a facet as well because uh it's actually been a long time I used this so we have to create a facet so this is what are facets facets are",
  "a facet so this is what are facets facets are something uh which is going to Club your data together if I'm not wrong X facet yeah we have got it so facets are something which is going to C your data into uh it's actually going to suggest you to Club it into certain different types okay so facets then text F so because this entire column is a text column and obviously if you guys are wondering that why am I able to see only 10 rows because it's a filter over here just simply select 100 and it's",
  "filter over here just simply select 100 and it's going to show you 100 okay so uh facet and the test facets all right just uh this one all right so you can see that we have got all these different types of uh different types of products items listed over here okay now we are going to click on cluster click on cluster and it's going to give you multiple options okay you can see that we have a method which is of key collision and nearest neighbors if you guys have gone through the MLT and MLF",
  "if you guys have gone through the MLT and MLF courses you guys espeically the MLT course because MLF I don't think that we have the nearest neighbor all these algorithms present in MLF so if you if you guys have done the MLT course then you will be able to recognize this nearest neighbers there was something like a nearest neighbors right so we have multiple approaches to actually do this okay so first one is the first me method is key Collision okay and the key function is we have multiple",
  "okay and the key function is we have multiple keing functions as so we have fingerprint and let's just try each one of them okay I'm using finger I'm using the method key collision with fingerprint keying function okay simply click on cluster okay so no clusters found okay problems engram all right no clusters again uh all right so uh this particular key function is able to find few fun few matches and now you can see that we have it has clustered few things together which is table cover Okay",
  "few things together which is table cover Okay so it has clustered the small table cover and the large table covers together now what we can do is we can merge these two uh different items into one okay and we can mention we have what I'm going to do is I'm just going to keep it table cover okay so I'm going to replace where wherever table cover small or large is present I'm going to merge these two take over here merge and the new value will be table cover okay same goes with the curtain okay",
  "table cover okay same goes with the curtain okay simply check this particular box which is asking you to if do you want to merge it or not okay I going to merge it definitely and the new value would be simply curtain okay that's done and what we have to do is uh it should be merged selected and recluster okay you have to click over this particular option which is merge selected and recl cler it's what it's going to do it's going to merge these particular values and recluster your entire data",
  "particular values and recluster your entire data set for once again checking if there are certain uh possibilities to Club your uh items together or not okay so mer and cluster it's now it's not able to find it so as you can see that mass edit 10 cells in column item so it's it has done that editing okay let's check for other uh functions as well is it able to find for meta 1 three no it's not able to find all right colog if I'm pronouncing this function right and let's check for this as well B",
  "function right and let's check for this as well B Mo it's clustering nothing Fair okay let's check the nearest NE ones okay and the nearest neor we have only two options which is Le time and PPM okay let's check for Le time nothing was found okay let's change the radius parameter let's change it to five and cluster all right now it's able to find okay once I change this radius parameter it's now able to so uh can you guys relate what I'm trying to say it's actually searching its neighbors",
  "to say it's actually searching its neighbors within an within a unit distance of five okay so this is how the nearest neighbors algorithm is working it's able to uh you know it's searching all its neighbors within a radius of five and then it's present us with the possibilities of merging and definitely with the bed sheets large and small we're going to merge it to just bed sheets and also I'm going to change it to a single word which is bed sheet okay curtain uh we can leave this one okay uh",
  "okay curtain uh we can leave this one okay uh because curtain and AC curtains are something that uh which are bit different okay AC curtain are actually plastic made and curtains are usually fabric so we can leave this uh but I can see that AC CS are only two rows and obviously two rows aren going to produce much output so why not just mer the okay now the next one which is pillow covers and table covers there is no sense in merging them obviously because pillow covers are different from table",
  "because pillow covers are different from table covers right no sense so I'm not going to click on this mer okay next one is table cover and table mat these things are similar right so table cover and table mat they are pretty similar we can merge with uh new value which is table cover okay simply mer Center and it has edited 20 cells over there can you guys see that it has edited 20 20 cells and now let's increase the radius once and check it once again okay so now it's giving us a much bigger",
  "again okay so now it's giving us a much bigger uh you know a much bigger catalog to choose from okay now it's giving us do we want to okay we can also browse entire cluster so browsing cluster basically means that it will just fetch out all the uh rows which have these uh particular items okay so we can check that once I increase the radius it's it's going to give me just it's going to increase the entire catalog of things okay uh next one we can see that pillow cover CH covers there is no",
  "can see that pillow cover CH covers there is no sense in merging them push cover sets and obviously there is no sense okay uh yeah there is one sense over here this one makes sense curtain and curtain gy should be merged into one okay we have pillow and pillow cover no sense in merging them and same for this one okay let's merge and recluster and it's done so 11 cells were uh changed and that's it so this is how you can you know tweak these simple parameters and you can actually check how uh",
  "parameters and you can actually check how uh you can actually check different clusters you have been given if I just increase it to let's say 20 it's going to give me a really long cluster okay it's not really long okay so uh all right so okay it's not giving me that really long one uh let's change our distance function to PPM and I will reset the radius to five okay and cluster now can we see some things that we can change nothing there is nothing to be changed okay let's change it to five or",
  "to be changed okay let's change it to five or 10 and then cluster nothing to be changed again no luck try let's try changing this one okay so uh it has given me a really long one this time and I actually don't have any clue what this block chars actually mean okay you can check it uh on your device what this block CH actually means but I have no CL at the moment okay and we can increase it so somehow if you increase this particular parameter it's going to reduce the number of options it give",
  "going to reduce the number of options it give you and uh yeah if you reduce it it's going to increase it and if you are increasing this one yeah so it is something like that and you can actually check how you can actually cluster your values okay you can also give it a try for fingerprints nothing nothing so this entire data which I'm working on ly it's just a small subset of the data I had okay I had about I guess six no I had about 821 rows in my data set and uh this is just a small section",
  "my data set and uh this is just a small section of the data which is 105 that's why it's not able to produce that many clusters okay but when I performed it on my 821 record data then it was giving multi options and I was able to fetch it I was able to Cluster my items and it went fairly smooth okay now just close it all my uh changes have been made okay so all these changes have been made and what remains is that simply exporting it okay here is this export option I just yeah here is this",
  "is this export option I just yeah here is this export option towards the top right click over here and then I have to uh export it to Xcel X let's go with this one okay I'm going to export it XEL X and the file name should be build data remastered okay so this is just game terminology so yeah remaster and if I open it all right so this is the uh data which we got so table so uh in the previous data you can see that we had uh table cover lar small and all this mess and it has been solved okay so",
  "and all this mess and it has been solved okay so this is how you can use open Define and quickly change your you quickly Custer your values into one okay so it just cuts out a lot of tedious task okay for you and you can do it so just like one person in the very first live session which I took said that you can either do the tedious task or the tedious task okay so that's a really good line which he gave I I guess it was aric and uh yeah you can either do the hard work or you can do the tedious",
  "either do the hard work or you can do the tedious okay so that was it for uh open refine any questions what's the idea of open refine like uh use this or like can please repeat uh like uh what's the goal of introducing this open refine like I mean is there any value add for this like I mean like perhaps so we are just introducing tools which you which will actually help you uh which will actually help students in their future okay so we trying to build uh tools Al Arsenal for them and uh",
  "to build uh tools Al Arsenal for them and uh introducing new tools and for example open refine in my case when I was doing TDS back in May 2024 there was not much use of it okay and open refine it was only limited to one G uh which I gave and uh yeah it was over for open but when I actually took BDM project in the next term September 224 term and I had this problem and it instantly clicked in my mind that okay I learned something like open desine and uh then I was able to solve it so it's like",
  "and uh then I was able to solve it so it's like we are giving you an arsenal of things we just introducing stuff to you nothing much in depth and uh if in some scenario in some future scenario the requirement arises then you can just get into that tool it's it won't be something foreign to you okay so that's the ideology behind introducing open any other questions guys or should J take over now I Nima uh what's the other person jar and yeah you have a really long name uh okay so no questions",
  "have a really long name uh okay so no questions okay no questions that that's really good okay so I'll stop sharing and uh jaaj kindly take so for for uh hello okay so all right uh so whenever we send a request to any Epi or mostly like logs and these things will also be stored and configuration files like if there is some configuration file that is related to Docker container then I think it will um is there any example over here all right so like uh there is a lot of data that generally used",
  "uh there is a lot of data that generally used to be stored inside inside Json so this JQ is one of the tool that can be used within shell to explore the data anyway um so this is yeah uh is hello H yeah yeah is it possible like for the previous question can you just explain those four or five steps what is that actually like yeah here in the question fth one please come down okay yeah still come down okay so what are the steps here like uh can you just explain this like the one two4 I think",
  "you just explain this like the one two4 I think Shan did it right yeah yeah that is generically he explained the tool um so what is that which is uh here actually like um group misspelled city names use poer to group trees that refer to the same city despite variation in the spelling for example this Tokyo and this should be the same filter seals entries select all entries where the product is used the number of units Sol as 55 aggregates Ser read by City op clustering name group The fil trees",
  "by City op clustering name group The fil trees by cities and calculate the total for each City identify the top performing City determine which of the by doing this how many units of shoes were sold in this particular City on the transaction with at least 55 units uh let's have a look at the Json I don't get a chance to look at this so this Jason have these cities and then product and then uh sales right like uh Hara yeah sorry have you used open refine no sir I have not used open refine but I",
  "refine no sir I have not used open refine but I I think from his explanation I can understand so I'll use it but what I want to know is like what are the criteria here actually okay so basically first you you have to do three four things okay you will be using open refine that can cluster different see if there are mistakes in the spellings then it will cluster them as same city so this will get clustered with yeah got it yeah got it first point once you get the cluster after that you download",
  "once you get the cluster after that you download that data okay it cluster and then you can download it it will classify this to and this to as the same uh once you download it you can apply filter on yeah two filters applied done then and after that you aggregate with the CT done and then and yeah now the final question is like uh um he's asking about Lagos actually there he's asking identify the top performing City so that's why was why are we doing those first four uh here it is like some",
  "we doing those first four uh here it is like some other city like losos there it is identifying the top performing City till three it makes sense four why we are doing it determine which city that is another question again here that was confusing H is it in some top cities I was okay it's fine if you can clarify also later also it's fine uh sure sure sure we yeah I don't want to hold you up actually just a few questions actually like little this one I had and then the last one the images I did",
  "one I had and then the last one the images I did put together the images I got it fine but still it gives like uh some kind of like like the last one um that is like a Sci-Fi image I just put it everything this is the one right it works fine actually all things are put together I get a proper image yeah uh just within 10 lines you get it but uh the thing is it keeps saying like some image size something like that I still keep the original image size but somehow so that was one like anyways I",
  "size but somehow so that was one like anyways I think you'll get to that but uh even though I get the answer it doesn't look like the answer so that's why actually the okay so that means you your answer is incorrect is it yeah it says incorrect but visually if you see it looks like the image it looks the proper combined image they have given the sections how to reorder like an array yeah so you just use that and then use pillow or something that and then do that once you get the real image",
  "that and then do that once you get the real image actually you just have the same size as the original image but still yeah this is another so I had like two or three like this so that's okay so there is difference in the size right yeah not only on the size it says but still I do not know why it's the same 500 by 5 okay are you using the same image format yes yes I use the same I I download that image and then from that image I use Python to manipulate it and then so it's a w image so did you",
  "it and then so it's a w image so did you reupload webp no I reupload the off what is it reconstructed image and what is the extension for that image Okay one minute uh okay uh one minute I I had done it like uh four five days back I don't remember one minute I'll just tell you uh this is jpg right the original image the other one was uh uh jiga [Music] and that's also jpg sorry that's also jpg but this is not a JP gpg right when I'm trying to download it downloading as an oh yeah yeah it says",
  "it downloading as an oh yeah yeah it says that web whatever that thing yeah webp yeah uh but actually it is a JPG like I just changed it to jpg like oh should we do it as web web PG like that yeah so try to keep it consistent okay okay okay that's a I'll try that okay I thought actually like it's a nice thing so it's the extension problem you're saying I believe so mostly um so have you done question six question six yeah done it works all right it's a simple uh so I think uh what you would",
  "it's a simple uh so I think uh what you would have done is it question yeah all right um okay can you tell what did you use sorry uh one minute actually I'll tell you I have the code for that no no don't uh tell the code just tell the because my memory is bad one minute I forgot actually there are many two things too many things going around sorry this is 5or 6 okay this is this one was about Json yeah yeah uh uh this one was uh you just use Spas then you are given a Json and then uh yeah it's",
  "then you are given a Json and then uh yeah it's a Json L actually and uh uh that's all you just pass it and then do it that's all it's not uh I mean is there something different like what I like this is not proper Json right this is Json luh yeah this is Json L yeah yeah yeah yeah so how did he load it in pandas um you have to first repair it and then you load it um okay can I show if you want yeah sure sure sure sure okay can you see yeah your screen okay one minute is it oh this is one right",
  "screen okay one minute is it oh this is one right sorry yeah um this is the one right 56e I just uh where is that uh where is that 6 one this one no this is one right yeah wait I'll just check if that I think that's the that I got it right okay so this is the one yeah so this is um so what you wanted actually like uh this is actually you have to fix that and then do it that's all actually there's nothing much to it see there's a uh this is just loading there nothing you just have to fix this",
  "loading there nothing you just have to fix this uhuh okay and once you fix that actually like uh so you're calling here this is the master function which is calling that actually the child function and then once you get that you get the reconstructed thing actually like uh and then you do a query yeah so it is like if uh can you go a bit up where you have that yeah yeah over here the first line so for example on line number 113 uh you don't have the closing quotes and for ID right and then that",
  "the closing quotes and for ID right and then that Curly braces yeah that is what exactly you are doing is you're looping over the file by line by line and then if you're checking if the closing braess is there and then you are also checking if the codes is there and if they are not there then you putting them right yeah yeah yeah yeah and it worked actually like for this problem it worked for some problems it's little bit tricky actually like it's cleaning up is this one cleaning up was easy",
  "it's cleaning up is this one cleaning up was easy yeah and then it's a simple actually the way I have done is I have used those what you call regular Expressions oh oh yeah yeah that's also a neat way I think I I tried that actually like this is what you mean like something like that okay anyways yeah yeah that's also one way to go about it I just loaded it into D and then yeah can you show me yours actually like I'm also interested toh it is similar to yours okay okay that GP one okay okay oh",
  "to yours okay okay that GP one okay okay oh the grip thing oh yeah yeah yeah this is the exact same thing that I have used yeah that is one way actually like uh there are yeah this one was easy one and then exactly I used a sorry I mean I as yeah you like o it is fast yeah yeah you're right I also like o sometimes it's uh good actually I use this for uh uh like what is it the third and the fourth in that project like um using JQ I used one and then the other one I used one actually when I used",
  "the other one I used one actually when I used uh like I hinted it to use this like uh for the llm because when I use the second approach actually like uh I had written hardcoded but when I used the first approach to make the llm only to tweak it uh I had asked it to use few tools actually this was one of them and then I like whisper like that image that a audio audio yeah usually I use speech recognition like actually I worked on one project where you have this Twitter feeds and okay I think",
  "you have this Twitter feeds and okay I think yeah it's yeah something like that actually you have a pipeline where you convert like from audio to and then you put it into text and then you pass it and again you do some analysis on that and then you do like that actually like so you can you can use analysis for that yeah yeah but there there are some problems which are really hard in this Swift one but anyways I think you will like for me it was cleaning up okay so this one I'll show you the",
  "cleaning up okay so this one I'll show you the reconstructed image it looks like it's highi um but uh oh reconstructed oh I think it is open yeah this is what I got this but I think as you said maybe it looks like the same no it is exactly same I think when you you are uploading it it say size is yeah yeah you're right minute I I'll just uh actually like uh I um which that fight 10 yeah this is the one I think so um it was simple enough actually you just have to construct it that's it actually",
  "you just have to construct it that's it actually but uh some error actually I I then I felt like what see I'll show you this one check something it says do not match with the original okay image pixels doesn't match with it's not about file type I guess I I guess I don't know maybe they didn't write the error properly yeah but uh if you have any clues actually let me know I think I constructed from the same image size uh but um this is the same image size it's being used M plot lib instead of P",
  "size it's being used M plot lib instead of P but same result it's the same thing it constructs I mean yeah at least by visual you can use even visual libraries but Vision libraries also like actually whichever I'm getting the same kind of output like but I don't know for some reason it is looking for something specific I don't know so it's like almost close to the answer but still not got the answer yeah anys you I let you share actually yeah you can you can share you can go yeah so did you um",
  "can you can share you can go yeah so did you um cut the image into 25 pieces like mentions in the cut the image into no uh that was already given right that array is given right one minute I'll show you the array is given right see this this is the array the matx is given to us we just have to put the parts we just have to put the parts this P makes it like as if like you can manipulate it so you just have to put the parts right I just put the parts like crop and paste crop and paste is that",
  "parts like crop and paste crop and paste is that how it is or like is there some other what what's the expectation different Hello H so it's yeah it is correct like seems correct but this is the same exact I even verified it also like with an llm actually I just verified it just in case because I do stupid mistakes like copying four three and all actually but and this also somehow looks the same like actually I mean looks like this should come here no actually like oh can you click on that I",
  "here no actually like oh can you click on that I icon I icon I which is I uh on the yeah this one okay so does it tell pixel details so 72 pixel per inch that's a DPA okay this is 500 by 500 Matrix oh yeah it is 500 but DPI is like are they interested in that I I don't know is that don't know okay but uh yeah anyways actually like yeah maybe if you can explain your approach maybe I can see I see some flaws I've done I felt this was a easy problem but uh somehow actually each and every problem",
  "but uh somehow actually each and every problem in this uh actually didn't give me result some of them got me result instantly but some of them even for this example this uh um I show you one more more that was even more interesting uh what was that there was ah yes this one I actually like there are like YT I used uh but still where was that that this one right this is the was that video video to this is still 10th One FM I used Wht I use Wht all the time but uh I got the translation and all",
  "all the time but uh I got the translation and all actually like uh vgt and then I converted uh and also one more thing is actually the same thing I even typed it actually literally like from this to this but still I don't know for some reason it doesn't match like words are too different it says oh it doesn't match for me as well I have to check why it doesn't ah it is literally exact words I typed it Al so actually like the expectation is it like because here there is one thing which differs",
  "because here there is one thing which differs it see he's using improve SEO uh using indexed words uh he so like he's trying to use through an algorithm so maybe that's why the output expected from the QA perspective is not matching the model predicted thing is what I'm yeah this is one more but but it's the exact words even if you manually type it also it's the same words this is one uh yeah there was one [Music] more this is what this one also I thought it was easy but I don't know it looks",
  "I thought it was easy but I don't know it looks is it did I get it oh I got it okay sorry sorry sorry this is seventh one right ah this is seventh one sorry I got it I I forget actually like which one I got which one seventh one is very easy right oh yeah seventh one is very easy like yeah it's just uh few lines of code actually like U this one I thought of using some other tool but I thought okay let's use Python I like python a lot so this one also the first one I use Python that's why I",
  "one also the first one I use Python that's why I suggested the the wait wait wait wait seventh one I think you have used wait a second this one I use pandas the six step procedure this is why I was suggesting pandas to use so that you can Co and all actually like just a pipeline so that's why I was suggesting that yeah sorry you were saying something yeah uh for the seventh one you have used igon right ion what is that uh that is python Library module I Jon yeah so when you have big files like",
  "module I Jon yeah so when you have big files like in the seventh one we have very big Json file right in that case we generally use I Json I just scroll a bit up sorry uh on the G5 page here on this page yeah this one so scroll a bit up up sorry uhhuh I keep scrolling keep scrolling keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going uh keep going yeah this is the one oh I so no I not heard of this okay so this is used when you have big files so it uh it pares in the batches wow oh that's",
  "so it uh it pares in the batches wow oh that's good batch processing I like it okay wow very nice good to know I thought you you would have used this now use Simple Jon so it's a rer on top of it which is iterative okay maybe theyve used uh maybe they have used uh okay so they have okay okay okay okay okay [Music] oh nice thank you thanks okay yeah that's good okay yeah some problems I got it some problems I'll try that also that's good thank you yeah and then yeah please let me know get that",
  "yeah and then yeah please let me know get that was um I use programmatically also I don't know why it is like what kind of similarity it is for I use even embeddings also like it's looking very specific it's like you're close answer this is also yeah maybe if you want it you hello yeah yeah sure but I appreciate all your effort I mean uh very inter you guys work a lot and actually appreciate your time I like that your project you have used what you call prompt oh promp do you want to see I will",
  "call prompt oh promp do you want to see I will show you no I I mean our script is also similar oh okay okay okay you know exactly actually like you see the model which we use it's a very lowend model but so you have to keep on tweaking the PR but if they had given me opportunity like I mean you can there are many models in hugging face you can like actually like you can you can use many kind of architectures there was lot of limitations and we are not even to use our own Keys also like too many",
  "not even to use our own Keys also like too many constraints ah that is something you can use not like no no you can use your keys but you would have to put it inside the docker yeah yeah I had already put it actually I had embedded it I had encoded it so that actually like yeah but um I had initially and then actually like on like last but one day I started using this key that is yeah I mean you you can use it but the thing is like then it is get getting evaluated okay and for some reason if it",
  "getting evaluated okay and for some reason if it fails MH like let us say your you you run out of tokens then it won't be able to pass those test yeah yeah yeah but I'm sure my key won't run out of tokens I know that but uh yeah but actually this was like a good because you see the problem of getting zero is also very highly likely but any actually like it was a good thing but that's the reason I was asking usually you see you will write a bdd uh like behavioral design okay and then the PDM",
  "uh like behavioral design okay and then the PDM will come up with that that's why I was asking for a test suit and the other doubt also which I didn't get clarified was like whether it's a query parameter or a body parameter so I've taken it from both if one is null I take from that or if one I take from that or else I throw so actually like I some of the questions I didn't get answered um I checked the discourse one gentleman suggested that but when I saw lot of people have are having only",
  "but when I saw lot of people have are having only questions like very low little answers so I just thought maybe that's not the right so I just qued it and sent it yeah you see what I suggest is actually one feedback is which I have is see there are so many tools maybe there's a priority order would be good like because you can't learn all the tools so for example JQ is like in the top of the list it's very good tool you use it almost all the time like when you're working server side you will",
  "like when you're working server side you will use it all the time but some other tools maybe it's not so maybe restructured like that it would be much better and the confidence page of this also could be restructured like actually the um this one prompting it was good actually like there are some things but they get restructured in a better way like if there is [Music] information feed oh sure Jo next session but please come if you have if you have clarifications please come up yeah I think I",
  "have clarifications please come up yeah I think I will end the session over here itself okay and then we'll continue from the next question in the next session yeah please get clarifications on in case if you get yeah that would be great thank you yeah have a nice evening take care thanks for",

  "going on. We've got a It's got a live stream going. This live stream, hopefully is configured correctly you never done it directly to to YouTube before. But from what I Okay, so for those of you will you Been told this live stream will go  directly to YouTube on the playlist on TDS Channel. Okay, so You can. If there is a problem, just let us know.  Okay. Before I start, let's see. Examples for partly and pisaret to be installed. Okay, so This will only take a few minutes and I promise you,",
  "will only take a few minutes and I promise you, it'll be worth it for if not for you, at least for a lot of of students. Okay, so here's my screen visible, and I'm actually audible  Okay, so project the task is simple your task is to create an application that runs anywhere in anyone's machine and the way we achieve it is using Docker. In other words, your  application sits inside a docker image that Docker image should run on any system in you. What does your application have to  do? Only two",
  "What does your application have to  do? Only two things, it's got to.  Is it okay? We will worry about that later. Okay, let me just finish Okay, so What does your application have to do? Only two things? It should reduce two endpoints. Okay. it should reduce an endpoint on your  local host port 8000 and one  endpoint is run, which is a post request. Okay. This is important. Okay. This is a post request. And the other one is a get request. Okay. And the parameters of this endpoint is task and",
  "And the parameters of this endpoint is task and the other parameter for the get request is path, okay? So this is all your application has to do. And there is one more. thing that to keep in mind. So normally when you send a request, okay, you put it into a browser window and you're able to get a response, but that only works for get requests if you're trying to do debugs on this request, you cannot put it in the browser window. And why? Because it's supposed to question. for that, you would",
  "it's supposed to question. for that, you would have to use REST client, REST API client. Usually you can use Thunderbird, or postman or you can even you don't even have to rely on those. You can write a small piece of code that sends the request on your graph and see the response you get from your own. So, okay, it's same like contacting an API when you contact an API, you send a request, right? And then you look at the response, like when you're contacting the open, AI or yeah, proxy. What",
  "contacting the open, AI or yeah, proxy. What you're doing, you're doing the same  thing, right? Yes, sending a request. And you're looking at the response, guess what? You can write the same piece of code to See this URL as well. Okay. So and you can see what the response is. So you can test it that way. You don't  need ThunderClan or the  postman, you can just write a small little code that can. do that for this. But having said that, you can choose whatever method is it? Okay? Next thing",
  "choose whatever method is it? Okay? Next thing tasks have to complete within 20 seconds. So when when this  endpoint is triggered, okay the response should come back within 20 seconds. That's in case you haven't noticed it. It's on the A project page. Okay, so with this in mind, this is the only thing your application has to do. It's that simple, okay? Now the question is, How do we do that? Okay, so your your  application will have some code, okay, represented by this purple file. And it might",
  "represented by this purple file. And it might need some external dependencies. Okay, these external dependencies,  Okay, they will have to sit inside either a metadata at the top of the file. Okay. And you may need several, Kinds of modules or dependencies or  things. So we're going to next. Look at how this file is constructed. Okay, this is your application. This is an  important deliverable that you should have. So what does this file look like? So the first part is metadata, Okay, you can",
  "So the first part is metadata, Okay, you can see over here, clearly this is the metadata metadata will have a script at the top and the  reason you want this is so that your application can run by you. Is it absolutely essential to run your application with you, the answer is No. Okay, you can build your application using any technology you want, flask past API, anything? Okay, The only thing we care about is when the application is running. It should provide these endpoints and you should do",
  "should provide these endpoints and you should do the tasks, we send it. And  these are the two tasks in this, okay? But the reason why it's useful using UE is, it'll become clear it handles virtual environment creation it handles, instillation, of  packages, all automated, so that's why it's useful to do it so that you don't have to debug more and more things. okay, so that's why we recommend using a week, but it's up to you what technology you're comfortable with use that. The next part of",
  "comfortable with use that. The next part of your file will contain importing the modules, that  should be pretty straightforward. one thing that I will say is, Endpoints, they're supposed to produce two this. They're supposed to a HTTP response, right?  so, like 200 or 404 or 500, and this one's probably 200 or 404 something like, okay? So that's what these two endpoints have to produce as a response. And you may need. To send that response either, as so  sometimes you along with the  response",
  "as so  sometimes you along with the  response code, you may need to send some data back, right? That data might be in the form of a proper JSON response  depending on what the task is, or it may be a plain text file. So something to keep in mind is you might need this JSON response when you're sending  back using FAST API or the other one is called. Is called plain text response. Okay? Those are the two ways your functions can return in response code, plus the content we are expecting to see.",
  "code, plus the content we are expecting to see. Okay? Any questions over? Are you with me? so far?  >> 24F2004595 RISHIT JAIN: So ever now.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, tell me.  >> 24F2004595 RISHIT JAIN: So could you repeat this? What are you expecting from? Plain text? >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so there are some in project There are some tasks, okay? For example a task, they're just quickly go back to project here. So if you look there are some tasks where for example, it is expecting. There",
  "tasks where for example, it is expecting. There is it? there was a task, I'm trying to find where it is. Was a task that required a file to be sent back. in the response itself, I think it was A7. Right. The email address, the email  address. Okay. So If there is a task that requires A plain text response. So, plain text means it will. So normally, when you send a JSON response, what will happen is, it'll, it'll send the response in quotes, Okay? Let me so normally, when you send the JSON,",
  "Okay? Let me so normally, when you send the JSON, response, it will send it in quotes. I'll give you an example here. So that you can see for yourself. Mmming ones. yes, once in Right. Books.  Okay.  Just share this screen here is going on.  Okay, is it visible?  Okay, so all right, so Yeah. So, if you just a bit bigger,  So, I've got a server running here, Okay, and typically when you send responses back, they will be this JSON response. Okay? So I'm going to show you the difference, Okay? So",
  "So I'm going to show you the difference, Okay? So this is JSON response. And I'll say content equal to students, okay so this is all it's doing. It's reading a student's text file and it's sending it back to  whatever is requesting. Okay? And it's responding to this endpoint here. Now if you've noticed my server automatically reloads every time I make any changes to this code as long as there is no. syntax error. In this code, it will automatically reload the server without me running and",
  "reload the server without me running and stopping this. So, so, the reason that happens and I'll just show you in the terminal here. Okay, is when I run UV on, okay, if you use the dash, dash reload, it will reload whenever it detects, any changes. Okay, so that's that's why it was able to do that. So instantly reloads the server. If I go back to Okay, it will respond to this endpoint and it's the home endpoint. So it's reading the file and this is  what it's printing up. So if you say look at",
  "is  what it's printing up. So if you say look at the inspect of this file, And if you look at, Med, the network tabs I'm going to  just reload this once more.  Okay. and if you look at this so you see gets the 200 response and if you look at the actual response you see getting a  Med, some sort of response, right? But notice it's got these quotes on the end. Okay, this is part of the response. response. So, sometimes you don't want this quote, okay? This is particularly when it's, for example,",
  "This is particularly when it's, for example, read function. So remember, there were two tasks. I was showing you earlier and  one was the read read function, right? When you're sending something back, and it only wants the content, you don't want these quotes in there.  Your your task will fail and there are several questions that have been asked Why is my task feeling Looks the same as Ed result. But it's got these extra quotes. The reason is they're not sending the  response back as plain",
  "they're not sending the  response back as plain text, you're sending the response back as a JSON, how do you fix this? So you fix this by simply changing this response, instead of JSON response make it plain text response. This is a reason for a lot of errors, okay? I mean, when I say errors, I mean failing the valuation. Because there are some extra quotes in there. Right. So now if you look, I've changed this to plain text response. We're want to look at this. Endpoint again. Notice what",
  "want to look at this. Endpoint again. Notice what happened, okay. Now, let's look at the response, you see this response now, it's producing exactly the content of the file. Very precisely without anything  extra. if you look at the headers, you still getting the okay, 200? so you can see over here, I'm still sending the status code, which is required in your project. Please make sure that all the endpoints produce the required. reduce the required, what you call for it? Status codes. So for",
  "what you call for it? Status codes. So for this post request, there should be 200 for Success, 400 for bad request. So here let me ask you a question. When do you return of 400 bad request? Can someone give me an example? What would be a 400? Bad request.  See, please pick up.  >> Tanmay Garg: To incompletion of our task.  >> SIVANS: Server error.  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, not server. So good example. So  good, example of a 400, >> 23F3001356 SHAHBAAZ SINGH: Long format.  >> Carlton D'Silva: a",
  "SINGH: Long format.  >> Carlton D'Silva: a good example of a 400 bad request is you're asking something to be  deleted. That's a bad request. You're not going to honor that request.  >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: So that unable to process them.  Here, process anything.  >> Carlton D'Silva: yeah, so if they ask you to do something that you're not equipped to handle, that's the 400 bad request. Okay. And 500 is yeah. If there is some actual error in your agent and your agent is not being the Job",
  "in your agent and your agent is not being the Job properly. Return of 500, okay? like, so that's slight diversion from what I was going to go on but okay. Yeah, voice is very low. My voice is very low or you can't hear Okay. >> SIVANS: We can here said it's quite clear.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Alright, so I'll go back to what I was showing before. We'll try and keep the doubts very minimum. Okay, for this first part of  the session so that I can get  through quickly what I wanted to show.  Okay,",
  "through quickly what I wanted to show.  Okay, so we're back to here. So that's what the JSON. Response. Our plain text responses for next part of your this purple  file. That is your application. That we are interested in is the app construction itself, right? So this is where you would have your flask cap or fast API, or whatever you're interested in. This also, where you get your token, okay? I remember to get your token from the environment. Make sure your token uses, AI proxy. whatever.",
  "Make sure your token uses, AI proxy. whatever. The  Instructions were given in the project. Don't be wait from that, Will it work if you deviate from it May, or maybe it might not, I don't know the answer to that theoretically it shouldn't but why deviate and have problems, right? Just follow the instructions. There is even a line given in project that tells you exactly the line to use. So just use that. Okay? So that's what you would have to use. Let me Particularly.  You know, so it's a AI.",
  "Let me Particularly.  You know, so it's a AI.  Underscore sorry. Yeah, proxy. Underscore. Token. Okay. So, just use that, that is what  should be in your environment now. Can someone quickly tell me? What does it mean by environment? because many of you don't understand this,  What is environment?  >> 23F3001356 SHAHBAAZ SINGH: That we are using.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct. Environment is where your  application is sitting your  application is sitting inside your computer and in that",
  "is sitting inside your computer and in that environment, your operating system, that is directly running your application That is the environment. So in your operating system is sitting a  variable called AI Proxy token, which you should have given your own. key for it to work. And this. Environment variable is where your application is going to take its token from okay. Now, I know you will have some doubts at this point, but wait till I finish this this part of the session so that  then it",
  "this this part of the session so that  then it will become clear, okay. But just remember that's where this token is taking it from. It's taking it from the operating system. Where your application is running from. So if it is running locally on  your computer, that's where it's taking it from. If it's sitting inside a docker image, that's where it is. Taking it from, it is not taking it from your local system. It is taking it from the docker image. So that's what this token does. Okay, Another",
  "So that's what this token does. Okay, Another part of the application construction, you know, you may need cords depending on what the tasks  are. So that part covers your  How Application Construction?  The next bit of your purple file, your application. Are. Two functions, right? Why? Because there are what two endpoints correct. So you decorate, your endpoints. This is, these are called decorators. We decorative endpoint, with the get, and you decorate your endpoint, with the post. So what's",
  "decorate your endpoint, with the post. So what's inside the get? Quickly, someone quickly tell me.  >> 23F3001356 SHAHBAAZ SINGH: Question. And just  >> Carlton D'Silva: What's inside? The get? What's inside? The get function here? What endpoint should be.  >> 24DS2000071 KETAN SAINI: So it retrieves the data from  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no. Tell me what? Tell me the endpoint read. Yes.  >> LAKSHAY: Sir. Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: That that showed on anything else, should be there or just that",
  "on anything else, should be there or just that  >> LAKSHAY: Or no. Sorry.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct, what is it? What should be  inside your post endpoint?  >> LAKSHAY: Arun Endpoint.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so these are your two decorators. These are the two functions. Now, the function itself, Oops. The function itself, which are these. Define what your function does, right? So you could say, ah,  Now inside this are some parameters. Okay. What parameter needs to go inside here? Can",
  "Okay. What parameter needs to go inside here? Can someone quickly tell me?  >> LAKSHAY: Ahmed sir.  >> Carlton D'Silva: yeah, so for read It would be this parameter, right? This is a query parameter. So that's exactly what goes inside here. You have a read. And what kind of what kind of parameter is it?  >> V ARULVADIVELAN: String.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct. So it's a string.  >> LAKSHAY: Screen parameter.  >> Carlton D'Silva: right? Because that's what you're going to receive at this",
  "that's what you're going to receive at this endpoint. You're going to receive a string this endpoint. You're going to receive a string. So that's what you tell the  parameter is read and you could have many parameters. But the only want one parameter read and the same way for the post, right? So this could be and this is run task or something  like that. Okay? This you can name it whatever you want. But this top bit, This should not change. Okay? This is the endpoint that your application is",
  "This is the endpoint that your application is showing to the outside world. This you can name whatever you want, but these parameters have to be exactly what the specification says. So read and the other one is wrong. Sorry. Read and the other one is task. No. ah, So it's not read, sorry. This is path. And this is task. Okay. Why is it part and task? Because that's what it is here, path and task. This is the parameters that go into it and both are string types.  Okay. Is this clear so far?",
  "are string types.  Okay. Is this clear so far?  Okay, good. Now, inside this  function, okay is what the, what is going to do the job? Now these things I'm not going to explain in detail because this is simple simple logic inside  here. Read file. What do you do? When you get Ahmed when you get some? Get some string here, right? You're going to Require to parse what the instructions are. And those instructions, I'll show you now later the logic of how that breaks down, you parse those",
  "logic of how that breaks down, you parse those instructions and you do what you do, a file open, you find the file, you  read the file, and you do what return the fight, right? So at this, at this stage in the return, that you may need to do the what either? If it's a JSON response, then JSON just a plain text response. It's a plain text response. Make sure you're clear with what is being asked and you return exactly that. Okay, So that's so that's this function. This function is very simple,",
  "this function. This function is very simple, right? You understand this function, correct? Now, the winter time with the post  request, which is the run task something similar happens, you get the string query. You get what the parameters are. Now this these parameters are easy, okay? You should be able to make an API call. Just write this here. You should be able to make an API call. Do the AI proxy.  Okay, and that yep the call should extract. The file name. You want to read Sorry, I",
  "extract. The file name. You want to read Sorry, I apologize for my very bad  handwriting and Play that again. Okay, you have to extract the file name that you want to read, right? And then just send it back. That's all it's required. Yeah. So, this is very easy to do this. read function. So all of you should be able to do this Now this one is a little more  complicated, so I'm going to break this one down, okay?  Here. Also, you send an API call inside your post function.  There are two",
  "call inside your post function.  There are two approaches to running tasks. Okay? Now what I would suggest is you choose one or the other, depending on your skill level. so, The first method. The first method. Is called prompt engineering. Okay, which is a generate code and execute the code. The second method is called function calling method. Okay, in function calling what happens is You give Llm okay? Before I show you even function calling first, I'll talk about prompt engineering, some of",
  "I'll talk about prompt engineering, some of you at the stage where you're really running out of time. And you  want something to work. And in fact, this is the best solution I'm going to talk about the best solution first because it's the quickest. Fastest way, if you can get it right, Okay, so in the prompt engineering,  method, okay? You get a prompt which comes from here. Okay, from your post request. and you pass the prompt to this,  generate execute function.  Okay. You send it, send that",
  "execute function.  Okay. You send it, send that request. Send it to the LLM and The prompt, okay, the quality of your Will decide how good. The output you get out. Ultimately, what do you require you require Python code? That executes the task, right? So, if the LLM generates it for you and does the task, then your squat free, right? So from This prompt. Okay. Two things. What kind of code it is? So, is it a Python code or something is required  bash, for example, right. So it might you might",
  "bash, for example, right. So it might you might need to run npm or npx, for example, right? You may require something that it is not run in Python in order to run prettier for example.  So LLM should decide, right? What is going to what code? It's going to produce. It's going to produce Python code, or bash. Code is unlikely to require anything else. So make sure your prompt identifies that. Okay. And in fact, I can show you an example but I'll show you a little bit later. Okay, let me first",
  "show you a little bit later. Okay, let me first finish this Then once that is done, you want that output to come out in. So you have to provide it a JSON, schema. So it gives you something very precise, okay, you ask for the application  type. Oops. just for the application type, okay, That will be one of the keys in your JSON schema and you'll ask for the task code. So that is the code that it has to run. Okay? So once you provide this schema and you provide the prompt so this prompt has two",
  "and you provide the prompt so this prompt has two parts to it. One is what the user has sent the user task. but the second part of that prompt is what you have written as an  instruction, again, I'm going to show you an example. A very simple example, so it's very clear in your mind how you constructed. But yeah let me just get through this over here. so, you have to provide a schema and you have to provide two types of two parts to your prompt. One is your  instructions and one is what the",
  "One is your  instructions and one is what the user task is. The user. Task comes from the post request  now, inside this once you get your application code, you run, something called Sub-process  sub-process executes your Code at the LLM has generated. Okay? And there is a session the last the last session that we had it was a demonstrated how you do this I'm not going to explain that in grade detail noise. So what's that session? If you  want to understand how some process works or even",
  "want to understand how some process works or even better? Ask LLM how to run code using sub process, okay? If you do that, then you will understand how it works but make sure that you understand how it works correctly. so when sub process runs the LLM code, two things will happen. Either It'll fail or it'll succeed if it fails. Okay? What do you send back?  You? Send back the original prompt, Okay? Which is this bit over here? which your system prompt, as well as the user prompt. send it the",
  "prompt, as well as the user prompt. send it the code it generated, which came out of here, okay? and send it the error also that it generated from the sub-process. So there is process came from the error came from the sub process. Send this all together as the  context and send it back as the new product, okay? Now, at this stage, you want to keep a limit, okay? Now, here's a secret or a tip. If your prompt is very good. You will not need to even run it more than once. Sometimes you may need to",
  "run it more than once. Sometimes you may need to run it twice, okay? But keep a limit. So that is not an infinite loop. So remember to put a put it in a while loop and limited I'd say less than two. Okay? So zero one and then it's done, okay. so, Again, I'm I know you don't believe this, but if you are prompt is very good. I'm not talking about the user prompt, I'm talking about your system problem. What you are giving instructions if your use of prompt is very good It will not even make a",
  "of prompt is very good It will not even make a single error.  and as proof the solution cord that we have, As 40 lines of just the system prompt in 40 lines of system, prompt you can give it a very precise prom that will not make any mistakes and you will pass. Virtually all the tasks, all 20 tasks, without writing any line of  code to solve each of the individual tasks. That is how powerful this approaches. That's why I am stressing on this. Okay, once you succeed. okay, once this sub-process",
  "once you succeed. okay, once this sub-process succeeds then it's just a matter of sending it back to the original calling function and then returning your response code, Okay? So remember it came from here and then it's just going back with the response to this. Okay, second option. Now, this is for those that you know, you you don't understand how to how to create this, this first section or you're not able to prompt well or things like that if you're not able to do that well enough, then you",
  "you're not able to do that well enough, then you can choose the arguably the most structured fashion, okay? And this is where we have taught a lot of function. Calling what is function calling. So this second method you choose one or the other, okay? Don't do both. so, if you choose the function calling, we are solving a1 to it and here what happens is you give a prompt, okay? But you also have to send some tools with it and these tools have to be labeled okay? Each of these tools A1A to be",
  "to be labeled okay? Each of these tools A1A to be one, it is whatever names you want to call them. call them. And inside it, there will be a schema that tells what the actual function name, it is supposed to call. So in other words, the LLM, you tell the LLM look inside my core. I have. All these functions. Okay, I just called them A1A to till b 10. Okay, I have these functions sitting inside them and I've given the LLM, the description of what each of these functions do. And these",
  "of what each of these functions do. And these descriptions, you can kind of get from From the project page, but try to write it a bit better than the  project page because depending on how well you write these descriptions, it'll choose the right function to run. Each function generally will have an input file because it has to work on something and it'll have an output file because it has to give you something. So, these two parameters are required and depending on the task, you may need more",
  "and depending on the task, you may need more parameters, okay? But you are telling inside your JSON, schema here's the function name and these what I want function name and function parameters. So, when you send the prompt to open AI and you're getting a response, this response will send you the function name and the parameters where do these function name you use it here. If it tells you run A1, SO task goes in okay, task comes in from up. Into this choose function. And from this function, You",
  "this choose function. And from this function, You send up the, send it to the LLM, the LLM knows what functions are inside your program. And then from this one program, sorry, from the LLM, it will tell you run a 1 because the task requires even or run A2 the  task requires a run B10, because the task requires beta because you're already described it to the other, okay? Then you go on and carry on. This is normal Python coding. So you just code for those inputs. Don't hard cord names. Make sure",
  "those inputs. Don't hard cord names. Make sure these are variables you get from the  parameters, because why the task can have any name, any file name might be. So you have to be flexible enough to accept.  any number of parameters and any and they will definitely be an input and an output how you pass through them, you can get GPG to help you. So, those are the two main methods of solving your application problem. Okay? Any questions so far? We are nearly at the end. I will next tell you how",
  "are nearly at the end. I will next tell you how the valuation works.  Yeah. Go ahead. Kumar.  >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: animal cord should be, then need to create an elements or cords for  tasks as in. There are 20 tasks in total, you need to  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry, I can't. Can you just repeat that again? Please. Because a can't actually hear what you said.  Yeah. >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: so, in the llm generation one, that we  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, you don't have to create anything",
  "D'Silva: No, you don't have to create anything in the in the first method of  execution in this first method, you don't have to create 20 functions, You just create this one function. That's it.  Okay. Lakshay. These are quick doubts. I'll take them. Otherwise I'll just carry on. Yes. Yeah. >> LAKSHAY: Hello, sir. Ah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> LAKSHAY: Sir when I run evaluation dot P5 PI file on local system. ah,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. Okay, I'll stop you there. I've I'm going to",
  "Okay, I'll stop you there. I've I'm going to discuss evaluation next. If it's anything related to what, you're discussed over, I'll take take that out now.  >> LAKSHAY: Like I am having problem in A1 task only.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, I'll explain. Okay. >> LAKSHAY: It runs locally.  >> Carlton D'Silva: I'll explain why it is not working but I  have to come to the evaluate part of it for that.  >> LAKSHAY: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, any other one. Anyone else has a question regarding",
  "other one. Anyone else has a question regarding what we have discussed already? Aruna is next.  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Yes, sir. So after getting the prompt and from prompt I have get the code What do we do after that? >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, so you run this function called  subprocess inside. Sub-process, you put the cord that comes into it and some process is essentially opens another process on your server or  daughters. Yeah, it opens another shell or process inside your server and it",
  "shell or process inside your server and it runs that code as if your sitting at the keyboard typing. You we run like that only runs that code but this is why you need you okay? Inside your Docker image because when you're running this, Cord that came from the llm, you have no idea what dependencies and things are required in it. So having UV to run that for you will benefit you greatly, okay?  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Okay, sir. And  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. Sure. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ:",
  "D'Silva: Yeah. Sure. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: there are lots of tasks. Okay. So there are separate files for each of the tasks. So,  Yeah. So in main file do I have to write it explicitly? That import this file from here and then do I need to make the call? >> Carlton D'Silva: I'm not sure, I understood your  question.  Yeah. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Look, I have used this prompt to get cords. Okay, so now  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sure. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: I have lots of files like for task,",
  "ARNAV RAJ: I have lots of files like for task, even there is different, even do >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: How do I connect those files with my main code?  >> Carlton D'Silva: So, you use sub process to run, run the cord, right? Whatever processing required, you use some process to run it. So your application that the code generates, right? It will construct. So if the task is read this contacts file and sort the JSON and write it out to another file, right? If that's",
  "write it out to another file, right? If that's the task.  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Yeah. >> Carlton D'Silva: Then sub-process will run that task, right? It will read the read the file, whatever. The file name was. and it will output the file. depending on what the prompt was. And it will, it will store it in the  appropriate place, right? That's what >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: okay, so I don't need to  >> Carlton D'Silva: the code will do.  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: I,  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, you",
  "ARNAV RAJ: I,  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, you don't need to. Yeah, if >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: See.  >> Carlton D'Silva: you use this, if you use this first way, we are doing it, you don't need to >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Okay. >> Carlton D'Silva: do anything. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Just a need to write the correct prompt. That's it.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, so this is a beautiful way of  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Oh my >> Carlton D'Silva: doing it, Yeah? Okay. Right. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ:",
  "it, Yeah? Okay. Right. >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: Thank you. Thank you so much.  >> Carlton D'Silva: So the next. Okay, the next. Okay, any other quick questions related to what we are discussed over because I want to move on quickly to the next section.  >> 23F3001356 SHAHBAAZ SINGH: This method of a prompt will be. >> Carlton D'Silva: It's is it samra, is it Samra? ah,  >> SAMRA AHMED: Yes. Actually, I wanted to ask that we will be having two problems first for  returning, the JSON, schema",
  "problems first for  returning, the JSON, schema like, what type of cord it is and how the file should be handled, and the second should be there for the code. Or we can do it in one.  >> Carlton D'Silva: This say that again. Sorry, I didn't  understand.  >> SAMRA AHMED: you said for the prompt, we will give the response which should be like a Jason  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. >> SAMRA AHMED: schema. Like if it's a bash, then it  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct. >> SAMRA AHMED: will give the bash and",
  "Correct. >> SAMRA AHMED: will give the bash and if it's a Python it should give the Python code. So we will be having two prongs first two identify that which one it is and the second  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not two prompts you just a single prompt and you give it a schema to respond to you, okay? And when you say it's in your response, you tell the LLM in your response, I want to know whether it is a bash or python or whether it is. Sorry. But this bash of Python",
  "or whether it is. Sorry. But this bash of Python and you want the code,  >> SAMRA AHMED: so, like  >> Carlton D'Silva: There is another way to there's another way to structure this instead of giving a JSON schema you can just tell it, Okay. Give me  fenced cord block and I'll show you an example, very soon in your fenced code block. And at the top of the fence Clover block, it'll tell you, it's Python or bash, you then have to pass that bit manual, or you can send it the JSON, schema, and just",
  "or you can send it the JSON, schema, and just get the variable out of that. Those are the two ways you  >> SAMRA AHMED: So, the response should be the JSON. First, you should be the type and the  second should be the code.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, this is one way of doing it. I'll show you another way of doing  it. When I show you a small example a brief example, okay? >> SAMRA AHMED: Oh, okay, God. That and the task will be 20. There will be more than that.  there for  >> Carlton D'Silva:",
  "more than that.  there for  >> Carlton D'Silva: There could be, there could be more than that but that's why this this  method can take 30, or 50 tasks, it doesn't matter.  >> SAMRA AHMED: Hmm. Yeah, definitely.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay.  >> SAMRA AHMED: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: okay, next Yes. >> Yash Arabhavi: I'm good question, sir. So if  we are following the prompt engineering method and we are getting task code each time, so do we store it in different file each time or like how is, is",
  "it in different file each time or like how is, is it going to be asynchronous?  >> Carlton D'Silva: yeah, yeah, you yeah, yeah, you can you can store the file and run it or  you can store it in a variable and run it, it's up to you. You can decide how you want to do it.  >> Yash Arabhavi: Okay, so like if we store it keeps storing it in the same file, it wouldn't get  over it. And by another task running a second honestly or anything, right? When  >> Carlton D'Silva: I mean, if it is, if it is",
  ">> Carlton D'Silva: I mean, if it is, if it is a c, if the tasks are running asynchronously then it will lower right. Right. So that's  >> Yash Arabhavi: Correct.  >> Carlton D'Silva: why so  that's why you might need to write it in separate files. Just put >> Yash Arabhavi: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: a, maybe you can use a like a four digit UUID or something to give it  unique.  >> Yash Arabhavi: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: a unique names, you could do that or you could use a yeah, UUID is",
  "could do that or you could use a yeah, UUID is usually best use UUID because I've used UUIDS in projects before where I want unique files to be stored you know,  completely unified stories too. So >> Yash Arabhavi: Yes.  >> Carlton D'Silva: you can do that.  >> Yash Arabhavi: Okay, got it. Thanks.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. Okay, next question, please. If you can quickly, go through these  doubts, I really want to get to the next section because the next session will also answer more and more",
  "the next session will also answer more and more >> TELVIN VARGHESE: so,  >> Carlton D'Silva: questions. Yeah. >> V ARULVADIVELAN: tell.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. Well, we aruna vade. Okay.  >> V ARULVADIVELAN: You have said, like, we don't need to combine both the  implementation. Why is that? I know that.  >> Carlton D'Silva: because it is, it is very long. I mean, if your time is limited right then you really don't spend a lot of time doing both approaches, right use one or the other and",
  "both approaches, right use one or the other and stick with it. I would say.  >> V ARULVADIVELAN: Oh, okay. But said like,  >> Carlton D'Silva: There is nothing stopping. You see That is nothing stopping you from  using both methods but then don't expect us to debug it for you. Okay. Okay, yes. Tell me. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Like I am not able to read the file because of the path. Not been faced to correctly.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, yeah. Okay. I will I will. That will be the next part. I'll",
  "I will I will. That will be the next part. I'll explain how evaluation works and why you of having wise students are  having issues so we will sort that. Okay. Next question, remedy.  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: sir, in a prompting engineering if the LLM responds a bad script that I >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: have to done in the sub process, if the bad bad script requires some  packages that are not installed in in my, for example, Docker instance, and package, installing packages",
  "Docker instance, and package, installing packages also  required, so super user privileges.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: So how to  >> Carlton D'Silva: So typically Docker image runs as root, right? So it normally  installing packages is not a problem, But anyway, I will talk about that section next because we are not got to that section. So I'm not answer this out now. You wait, till I get  to the next. Then we will talk about  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: so another  another issue is",
  ">> PREMDEEP MAITI: so another  another issue is that if, for  example, I use Linux,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. >> PREMDEEP MAITI: So, if I am a developing the application locally, I cannot blindly done any, ah,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. Okay. That say okay. Okay, so okay, look, look, I'll stop. I'll >> PREMDEEP MAITI: commands that Llm gives me?  >> Carlton D'Silva: stop you right now. That is for the next section. Is there anything  related to what we have discussed?  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: Ah,",
  "what we have discussed?  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: Ah, no.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, next question from. I think it's tanmay, is it  >> Tanmay Garg: Yes. So I understood the limit that we put here, so there can be two types of, error like either, it could be a compilation error for, it could be a runtime,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. >> Tanmay Garg: error while the Compil.  error are there, so the limit logic would work, but if there is a runtime error where the answer itself is not correct and we  >>",
  "where the answer itself is not correct and we  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> Tanmay Garg: the evaluation moves on to the next function even though we want to re  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correctly. I understand. Yeah. So I  understood your question. So  again I will say it completely comes down to the quality of your product if you're prompt is very good. Then you will not see that problem. I can. I can almost 95% guarantee you that  is the case. This is also Ahmed's. what you call assurance on",
  "This is also Ahmed's. what you call assurance on this, because he has shown us how the solution works. And yes, proven that it's able to do it if you prompt it correctly. And again, Can anyone really okay? So jayashes is the last person here, can anyone? So there are 54 people here or little bit less than 50 people. How many of you how big can I ask you just a number. You can just speak up on the mic. How many of you what is the biggest size prompt? You have written? Tell me.  >> 24F2004595",
  "prompt? You have written? Tell me.  >> 24F2004595 RISHIT JAIN: 10,000 characters.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Greater lanes.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: 300 lines. >> Carlton D'Silva: Three, your prompt is 300 lines long.  You're prompt. I'm not talking about anything else.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Just system wrong. Not 300. Sorry. 135 blades. Just  >> Carlton D'Silva: So your system prompt is under 35 lens. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, just 125 and though based on those files are being",
  "125 and though based on those files are being generated to correctly.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so you okay, so that's great, right? I mean that's an example of doing the prompt correctly, which is your prompt has to be, well, defined and then it will do it to the job. correctly. Okay. So, our solution code has about 40 lines in the system prompt and then it runs all the tasks because it's well defined in 40 length, but you can choose any size, but the point is don't write three lines of",
  "size, but the point is don't write three lines of prompt and expected to give you the right answer, that will not happen.  Okay.  >> 23F3002537 ARNAV RAJ: with examp.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, that's fine. Examples. Also fine. But again. the quality of the prompt will make the big difference in whether you're cord produces collect output. Okay, I'll take this one last doubt then I'll move on because the next section is very important. This is where most of you are facing problems. Okay, Jaish",
  "most of you are facing problems. Okay, Jaish  >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: the sir actually for Task 1 and tax to we should do in one code only or we have to create two files and then we have to do.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Warf task. Sorry.  >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: Phase One Phase 2. We have to do in a one file or we have to  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no yeah, no. No. There are no separate files. Everything is run by a single application file. This  purple thing I showed in the  beginning,",
  "This  purple thing I showed in the  beginning, right? All of this? What we have discussed sits in that one file.  >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: So, all 20 questions should be in one file with 20 functions.  >> Carlton D'Silva: that is, if you are choosing this approach, >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: Okay. and so, >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: Result won't be ex. AI, proxy token, if you continue to see all the education,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry, I can't hear you. Not audible.  >> Kumar Anushka",
  "I can't hear you. Not audible.  >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: Exhaust, our AI proxy token or if we continue still all the LLM.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, so when you're doing testing test it out on only individual tasks don't test it out on all 20 in one group.  >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: Would be.  >> Carlton D'Silva: So, once you're sure that each task is working correctly, then I'll talk about the next section which is how evaluation stuff. Okay, okay, so that's the last question I will take",
  "okay, so that's the last question I will take because I really to get to this next bit. Okay, so now your tested your tested. your file, okay? And you put all the dependencies that are required and I'll show you a small example afterwards, Okay? You've got this file, and it's sitting on your local  system. Okay, now this is very important to understand this bit because this is where a lot of you are making mistakes. So your file is sitting on the local system. and when you do UV run or whatever",
  "local system. and when you do UV run or whatever it is, Python run or whatever. Your  however you're running it, it's working in your local system. So the next bit is very important, which is you've got  You've got a docker file, okay? Okay, you've got this docker file. and inside this docker file, you will have Will have some. Commands that tell it what exactly sitting inside, okay? So jivraj has gone through this, please watch the previous session if you want to know, clearly how this works.",
  "if you want to know, clearly how this works. If you look at, I think the first session Sort of towards them middle of the first session he talks about this,  and also in the second session that was done. Last time he again goes through this so you'll have some commands that are in there. One common mistake that people I say call it's depends on how your thing is Structured is one thing that might you might need to do is do this, make directory a dash piece last data, Okay? This is so that to",
  "a dash piece last data, Okay? This is so that to create your data folder at route because the reason is all your Evaluation will be done on files that are generated in there, okay, so  this enables it to have the right permissions to create the slash data directory inside your docker image, okay? Now remember I haven't talked about data GEN or evaluate dot UI at this point. So far, it has not have not talked about it at all. So don't confuse evaluate.u and data gender pyu. I'm telling you",
  "evaluate.u and data gender pyu. I'm telling you exactly what you need to deliver for the project too. Okay. so, once this docker file is created, then the next thing is, you take the image, you push the image onto Docker up, make sure that you use the Form submit those to us, the Github in Github, submitters your core cord as  well as in Docker, okay? And you submit both those on the formula, all of you know where the form is. And I don't have to repeat where it is, Okay, so you've created the",
  "repeat where it is, Okay, so you've created the document you you stuck this this piece of  Oops. You stuck this piece of code, inside the docker image and now, What happens, how evaluation happens What I'll talk about next. Now. We will pull your image. Okay. And it  will come from Docker Io. And we will sit it inside our system now, okay, now notice the difference here. Initially, when this file was sitting in your system, it was your  debugging it like this. Okay? Without the docker image,",
  "it like this. Okay? Without the docker image, because it's the quickest way to debug and solve any  problems. Yeah. Right. But here. This file is now sitting inside a docker image, your application is sitting inside the docker image. now, at this stage, so this gray color is our machine, okay? Also, At this stage evaluate DOT, PY and data. Gen dot pi are sitting on our server, outside the docker image and it's sitting on our server. These two particular files evaluate.py and data gender people.",
  "files evaluate.py and data gender people. Well, evaluate.py depends on data  gender people because it will call some functions. And those functions that it calls will generate some files and  evaluate dot. PY needs to know the names of  Evaluate.py needs to know what data Jain is generated. So that's why evaluate.py sits with data Gen dot p y inside our system, okay? Because it on it. Okay. Now What does evaluate.py do exactly what we told earlier. It will send some post requests, it will send",
  "It will send some post requests, it will send some get requests, that's what evaluate Dot poi job. Is it will send post requests and get requests and it'll compare compare what it sees in here  from the GET request with what data Gen has generated. That's what this will do. Okay. Now. when you send tasks to the first task it will send. Okay valued at py that is sitting not on the image but sitting inside the server when it sends this post request the first request, it will send will be the same",
  "the first request, it will send will be the same one request. Okay, what does  the A1 request? Get data gel from github, and run it. Okay, that's what it. So, it's not using even this data Jain to actually generate the data. It is using a file. from somewhere sitting in the cloud or it could be locally on the system So it depends. But it will send this task. To your application. okay, this is the first So your task should respond to it. And it should. Pull it from wherever it's supposed to pull",
  "Pull it from wherever it's supposed to pull it from and run that dot p. It is your first Execution that happens. So if you look at the function calling bit, right? It's this first bit, okay? It runs that code runs this data gen Now, what data Gen do? PI does is application, Okay.  Inside your application. So this is not on. This is not on your on our server, but it's inside your docker image itself.  Inside there, it will create a so, this should already be there, slash data and it will start",
  "already be there, slash data and it will start generating some files inside this folder. Okay. And it'll be all the files that are required for both Task A and TASKME. So, whatever files are required for task and does beetle generate those.  Currently the version of Data, Jain, you're seeing on Github. is not the final version, that is just been given for your convenience, so that you can kind of see how it works and get an idea of how to solve  tasks. Okay, so this is the  Process. Of how",
  "tasks. Okay, so this is the  Process. Of how evaluation works. Is this absolutely crystal clear.  Okay, so inside here is root.  It. Sorry, that's the wrong word. inside here is  Data sitting at root. So this symbol in Linux means root.  Okay. And the reason why it is, there is because You have.  Done this in your docker image. Okay, so it has the right  permissions. The correct permissions not only to create the directory but to run the DATA-GEN dot POI file without any errors. Okay. Now, why",
  "dot POI file without any errors. Okay. Now, why do students have problems? Okay. We have provided you this evaluate Dot. Pyte 5 and we are provided you, this data. Jain, Dot Python. If you do not mimic this setup, exactly the way I've talked about here on your local system, you will run into errors because you have not  understood why these are and where they are located and what they do. Okay. So in other words, It might have been working fine when it was running like this, but now if you just",
  "it was running like this, but now if you just simply take the value and data is on dot py. And if you stick them in here, Right. What is wrong with the scenario? Can someone tell me?  >> 24DS2000071 KETAN SAINI: So the files can change right evaluate or p by and detachment.py. so,  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no. What is wrong with this scenario?

  "your system. What is wrong with the scenario?  >> 24DS2000071 KETAN SAINI: Because then it doesn't dynamically take those form.  >> SIVANS: They're not trying great data. I think for the  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. One at a time. One at a time.  >> 24DS2000071 KETAN SAINI: I'm saying then it doesn't take those files dynamically and runs them. It creates data.  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no forget about that. That is  another issue. But what is wrong with this? Exact scenario? What's the difference",
  "with this? Exact scenario? What's the difference between this and this? >> TANYA KAMBOJ: Not not.  >> LAKSHAY: So, it will not pull the  >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: There is no directory.  >> LAKSHAY: In root Folder.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes, exactly. Right? A lot of  students are facing this problem.  >> LAKSHAY: Yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: It's not writing on route because guess what? You don't really want You don't want evaluate.ei running and data Jain or PI running on your route. You don't",
  "data Jain or PI running on your route. You don't want to execute unknown code on your system so your system automatically protects itself  from these kind of intrusions  So, how do you solve this problem? It is very simple. You stick. Your file inside the docker image your application. Run the application and now you have mimicked, the conditions of how evaluation works on ourselves. Many students do not understand this key difference. That's why they're facing a lot of errors. Okay, so that is",
  "they're facing a lot of errors. Okay, so that is one key difference, the second thing is, as some of you are  mentioned, we may not necessarily use evaluate.p by our data general period. We may use anything in the may be called anything, so, All we want you to do is provide what? Just this. This purple file.  And this green container. Okay. That's all we want you to provide. and what should it do? It should only run these two requests. Get request. And a post request. These two things. Are all",
  "And a post request. These two things. Are all that is required, okay? Now, we provided evaluate.u and data, and p y for you to debug your code in test conditions so that you can figure out what is going wrong. so, remember to mimic this setup, you have your dock image, you have your  valid.by, you have your data gender BI start your DOCKER image server, we are giving you the commands in the previous session. How to do it? And once you start the server, and it's responding to 8000, now you can",
  "server, and it's responding to 8000, now you can run evaluate.py and data, gender P1 and you will see some if your code is running well it'll give you the results if it's not running, well, it'll give you some results, okay? Now at this point, Ed. Are there any doubts before I go to the next section, which is briefly demonstrate to use some few things. I'll talk about in the next section.  >> ATIMANAS BISWAL: So, if  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, raise your hands, raise your hands. Okay, anishious.",

So I might have two different doubts. My first",
  "So I might have two different doubts. My first  doubt is, what are the things that we need to put in the GIT report? Do we? And just need the  Python script and the Docker file, or can we put in Evaluate.pu? And that will not create anything.  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no, no, no. Don't put evaluate Dot because that's not part of the anyway.  >> ATIMANAS BISWAL: So yeah, even if we have already put it in will it cause issue?  >> Carlton D'Silva: It won't cause an issue as long as your code is not",
  "won't cause an issue as long as your code is not hardcoded to it.  Yeah. >> ATIMANAS BISWAL: And then it's fine. So  In the Google form. You have given to submit the information about where we  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. >> ATIMANAS BISWAL: have stored our script and all you have given  us two things to do. We have to give our github repo, which was easy enough. But then you also give us to put in the Docker hub image. sir, and the website of  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. >> ATIMANAS BISWAL:",

I'll take that out later because I'll explain that later.  >> ATIMANAS BISWAL: Okay, thank you, sir.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. Okay. Anything related to what? I've shown so far because I want to show a brief",
  "I've shown so far because I want to show a brief demonstration after this. Yeah. >> 24DS2000071 KETAN SAINI: Oh, one thing.  we won't have the email file on our project. We won't even have the data in order data, right? In our project report.  >> Carlton D'Silva: So sorry, say that again, slowly.

Maybe  >> Kumar Anushka Abhishek: so that I was telling that I am able to run the A1 task within my terminal  without the Docker fight. So I was asking you, is it necessary to for the project to run those even task in the docker file?  So that was able to run without the talk about. I haven't created",
  "to run without the talk about. I haven't created one yet. I was able to Get the data gender by without. >> Carlton D'Silva: yeah, so a requirement of project is you should create a docker image and your application should be sitting inside the docker image and it should Run these two tasks. From inside the docker image, that is the requirement. If you don't have a docker image and your application is  not sitting inside it and it is not running the tasks from the Docker image, you will not pass",
  "tasks from the Docker image, you will not pass project. You will get zero. It is a requirement of project that your application requires this purple little file that  are talking about as which is all these things, which I just discussed has to sit inside a docker inch which is this green little box that I mean little circle, that is your  application should sit inside the Docker image and it should run the tasks from within the Docker. If it does not do that, and if you just provide us the",
  "does not do that, and if you just provide us the code, we will not you will get 0 because that is precisely.  What's mentioned in project. You have to meet all the requirements which are all the deliverables and evaluate section of project run, okay?  Okay, lecture next. Yeah. >> LAKSHAY: Hello, sir. Am  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> LAKSHAY: sir, when I running evaluation file on local system, it generates data and it  will read and write correctly wherever it generated data. But when I use",

On Github Rep.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so that might be the case. Just go to. All you have to do is go to the. Do you know the location? Just take the raw location of it and fetch the file from there.  >> LAKSHAY: Actually, I want to set a URL.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry. >> LAKSHAY: For data. Sir, I want to.  >> Carlton",
  ">> LAKSHAY: For data. Sir, I want to.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry, say that again.  Yeah, yeah that's that's the right way. It has to be a parameter only.  >> LAKSHAY: But when I am testing, it is not working on that github link.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, it is not working because maybe there is a mistake in the value, dot you'll have to make a  correction in the value.

There is no data's end dot py file on  browser.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so if you go, okay, let me share my screen so that you understand  Is my screen visible.  >> LAKSHAY: Yes, sir.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. so, If you go here, have you gone here before?  >> LAKSHAY: Yes, yes.  >> Carlton D'Silva: You go here. There's the data Jain Dot PI file, right?  >> LAKSHAY: Actually sir any evaluation dot py file. The URL is ah,  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no if I understood",
  "ah,  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no if I understood even the URL is wrong. Maybe it is wrong. That is fine. What I am telling you is you go here, go to the raw button. Okay, Copy this link and change it in the  evaluate.co. Files problem solved, right?  >> LAKSHAY: Okay, okay. Thank you.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Now. Yeah, but you're right. It should be a parameter the evaluate dot pi file. We are given is just to  help you but if you're finding bugs in it, yeah, you can do one of two things. You can",
  "it, yeah, you can do one of two things. You can either inform Anand's your discourse that hey, this link is not working or you can fix it  yourself, which I've just told you how to fix it, okay?  >> LAKSHAY: Okay, thank you so much.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, next summer.  >> SAMRA AHMED: Data Jain not p.

  "Correct. You should run only ones, okay? >> SAMRA AHMED: Only.  >> Carlton D'Silva: yes, and the good example was just just what the previous gentleman said, that the link was >> SAMRA AHMED: Yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: not working. And it's going to be like that, you're not going to get the same file. It's going to be something different so make sure you are able to deal with that. >> SAMRA AHMED: Even the name will.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, yeah, if your name might be anything, right? So it",
  "if your name might be anything, right? So it could be from  anywhere and from any, you know, the name could be anything.  Right. Okay next Yes.  >> Pritul Raut: I'm not facing issue with Evaluate.p or detergent, but your poi but my specific issue is whenever I use this header script for that, my application you can't  detect.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> Pritul Raut: I tried to copy that from last video from last meeting, but it's not still  working for me. If I create the virtual android,",
  "working for me. If I create the virtual android, it's properly working.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so I'll just circle back to your question real quick. Okay, just give me one second. I just  okay, so one thing I want to  Talk about. And now, it's probably a good time to talk about it.  Okay. Is this image Okay? This docker image now, there may be things that you may want to install in the Dock image beforehand to help you run your scripts. so, one way you can test your docker image is, of",
  "so, one way you can test your docker image is, of course, using the interactive shell which jivraj has  demonstrated before, use the  interactive shell and test and see just as if you wear on your local computer are things working fine? Okay. Launch the server. You're seeing some errors. Correct those errors. So whatever it is but something that may help you is  pre-install. Some packages on it that you definitely know I require. Okay that may help reduce the issues. you're seeing. So, here's",
  "help reduce the issues. you're seeing. So, here's an example  of a docker fine. Okay, so you can see over here, so this run command, right? Is basically commands. You would use for example, on your shelter, right? Get update have get  installed and then you're installing various packages.  and then another good example is, you know, that you need Nodejs, right or NPM or NPX because you will be using  JavaScript packages. So you need node to run JavaScript packages, you can do anything just in",
  "JavaScript packages, you can do anything just in your Docker image as part of your DOCKER image creation, just create the node, right? Just run the command curl command, okay, by the way, that reminds me some commands may not be readily available on your Docker image straight away. So After building your docker image. because part of the tasks may require you getting Getting something from somewhere, right from the Web. so innovatively that is either a curl command or some sort of command like",
  "a curl command or some sort of command like that. So install cool, you know, that's a good thing to install because you might need it. And then once you install curl, you can  install other things like node. Any other external packages that are not Python that you know, by looking at the tasks that yes these tasks would need some external packets. So install them no problem. so, you can see here for example  there are some pip installs, you know, maybe you want to install some of these these",
  "maybe you want to install some of these these applications because you're having issues when you're  trying to dynamically install them. So one good example is, I think some people have problems with fast APIs and people have problems with u Econ or you know and in fact giraj showed  you how to install a docker image with UV on it. But you can run these things. Okay? And the PIP install those things, if necessary on your system. Now, one thing to notice is these are these are directly installed",
  "notice is these are these are directly installed on the docker image, okay? So, there's not running within a virtual environment in document, it just installed directly because why it's just your application that's going to use it and that's it. So you can install some packages, what do you think are necessary? Okay, that's an example. Then. So this is the other thing I was  talking about working directory is app and then this is also shown in the session and then this one you can create the",
  "the session and then this one you can create the data folder. But as one, the other young gentleman just  shared with us even without creating this, IT data engine works fine on his on his docker in it. So that's up to you. And what's this? See how we token is being taken from the  environment. This the environment is the environment that is currently from the local system into the docker image. So, These are all the sorts of kinds of things. You can do. This might be useful command depending",
  "can do. This might be useful command depending on whether  you want to use PIP or not. It's telling ignore any tip complaint complaints about things being  installed on route. Okay? So that's just something you could do expose port 8,000. This may might not be necessary if you're running into problems, you can always expose both  8,000 and then, of course, you can come on, run things. So this is an example of a docker file, right? Which has if you're running into issues that with packages and",
  "you're running into issues that with packages and things you can pre-install, some packages that, you know, for sure you'll need There's no need to dynamically, get them. You can leave the dynamic part for when you really need it. And you can test it out. But some packages that, you know, for sure you need like, for example, I would if it was me and I'm not doing project for the first time and I'm a student, I would  definitely install node because I know there'll be some JavaScript JavaScript",
  "I know there'll be some JavaScript JavaScript part is done. Okay. So that's one thing, the other thing I was  going to mention was yeah, so this I was talking about code generation, right? So there was a section on code generation that I was talking about. How do you get it to generate clean code for you? So our constructed this very simple server, okay? And you can see over here, you can forget this first bit, Okay? Don't don't worry. that's just something I was testing  for showing you how to",
  "something I was testing  for showing you how to do plain text responses. But here I have a system prompt and a user prompt system. Prom says, you  are a. I hope it's visibility. It says you are. Programming Assistant. Only give me  formatted code inside fenced Code. blocks without any comments. So I want just clean code no comments and shiva inside fenced code blocks.  Okay, do you know what Friends Code blocks means? It means those three little ticks at the beginning and three little ticks at",
  "ticks at the beginning and three little ticks at the end. So that's a fenced code. so, then the user prompt which is the task that is coming in write a Python script that counts how many centis are there in in a Givening, okay? And so, I'm sending this to the AI completion. This is the header this is the JSON. This is the model. this is the message is the role notice. There is no function calling in here and there is no JSON, schema even in here. Okay? This is how simple the function calls now.",
  "Okay? This is how simple the function calls now. Let's, let's put as they say in, in some circles. Let's put my money where my  mouth is, right? So I'm going to run this now and you'll see how this works. If I go here.  Okay, what do you see?  Code for Python Code. Perfect code for Python code, it's even parameterized, okay? And the other thing is, if you notice at the top of the fence block, it says what it is Python, right? So if I instead change  the use of prompt season, if you go back to",
  "the use of prompt season, if you go back to the user prompt, right? I just said your programming assistant. But in the user prompt asset, okay  write a Python's get over here, right? I could change this, I could say, Write a JavaScript, write a write A Okay. So, you can do that and one more thing I can say and jivraj's  demonstrated this in this various session, you can have two separate. So once you have the task generation that generates the code, you can call two separate functions. If you",
  "code, you can call two separate functions. If you know it's a Python program, you can run a separate function that executes Python code and the sub process with it. And if it's a bash because those are the only two things you will use, right in project that's going to be bash or it's going to be Python Nothing else you're going to run, right? So if that's the case, you can  have two separate functions. One that only runs bash code and one that runs only Python code, and you can see what I've",
  "runs only Python code, and you can see what I've done here. Plain text response have extracted only the choices message and content and you can see clearly and that's exactly what it gives me. So earlier, I demonstrated that you can  have JSON, schema that gives you two variables, what code it is. And what the code itself. But if you willing to parse this, right, just parse the first line, And see if it is Python or not or see if it is bashed or not. And then remove these bottom ticks and then",
  "not. And then remove these bottom ticks and then just run this code. So let's look at the response here. Okay, so I go to test, go to response. I hope you can see this. in fact, let me See that me. Pop it out.  Oops. Okay. So this is the header 200. Ok, here's the response. Clean code, no extra characters except for the fact that there are fence blocks but the reason the reference blocks is because we instructed it to give us science blocks. Okay. But you can execute this right inside? Surplus",
  "But you can execute this right inside? Surplus is a simple as that. but, I wrote only what one line of a prompt. Right. Good prompts and you will be  able to solve all of all of  Project by tonight. Okay, that's the ticker. Okay. now, I'm going to Stop sharing.  Okay. At this stage. I'm going to ask one question, is it  clear so far, whatever I've shared Don't ask your debugging, doubts will take that next. But is it clear what I've shared with you? Okay, does it help you to understand how to",
  "you? Okay, does it help you to understand how to evaluate your project? How to run your tasks and how to construct your program logically? Right. Okay, so now is jivraj here in the session. Hey Jivraj here. Are you there or saransh? Okay, just give me a second. Okay. Thank doing this session is live streaming, So if you want to go to YouTube and rewind back to see if you didn't understand something, you can always rewind back and see but give me two minutes. I need to Need to take.  >>",

I actually started with started with making like a structured directories. Like there is a root directory  naming the auto task LLM. Then there is a src inside that in, which I put my Python files.

I hope this is the correct process, right? That's all it's following. Just, I'm confirming.  >> Saransh Saini: Carlton doing this telephone that part was not quite sure.  >> Carlton D'Silva:",
  "part was not quite sure.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. So  the way you transfer the environment variable two docker to the docker image, there's one of two ways. One is you can do it from within the docker image. When you have the Docker image create construction file, you can do it there or the other one is actually shown on your project page. We look on Project Page, there is a It says on there when you're running pod, there is like a podman dash Eh Air proxy token equal to AD proxy talks in",
  "Eh Air proxy token equal to AD proxy talks in right here, AI proxy token equal to dollar a proxy token so that >> Tanmay Garg: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: command if when we are associated number, we pull your image right? Currently it has no. Ah,  sitting inside your image, okay? >> Tanmay Garg: that's,  >> Carlton D'Silva: And what you we want to provide it the token that it should use, okay?  Because we will be using our own token from the environment, okay? so there is a command if you look",
  "okay? so there is a command if you look on project page, it's under evaluation If you go to evaluation, look at  prerequisites over there, there's a line Boardman run and says Dollar image underscore name. That's not exactly correct, but ignore that. But  there's a dash E and yeah, proxy. totally equal to dollar rate. That command takes the token from the environment and puts it into the docker image so that's what that command is. So your application then can pick up the token that Yeah,",
  "application then can pick up the token that Yeah, that's fine. >> Tanmay Garg: Got it. So actually, I would using that only but the new thing that was I was asking. Thank you sir.  >> Carlton D'Silva: the other way also is possible, you can stick, you don't have to put the token itself, but you can stick the During the construction of the image, you can say, this is how you pick up the token from the environment you could do that. But this this way, you  can leave, you don't have to put it in",
  "way, you  can leave, you don't have to put it in the image, you at runtime itself. We will we will write this. Does that code? That is given project. Right? That's what we will run. So when we run it, it will do it anyway.  So you don't have to  particularly provide it, just make sure that in your app file that the it has an OS dot environment that picks up the environment variable. Okay. >> Tanmay Garg: Go to.

The question exactly like it is saying that it will create, we have to find the similar commands. So we have to find  >> Saransh Saini: Hey.  >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: just the most similar pair command or every we have to pay every command.  >> Saransh Saini: have to find the most similar to comments the two comments, which are the most similar to each other.

So let's say I never deleted anywhere on the file system. So for this You have to specify to your Nlm, that if someone if there is a request which is asking you to delete some file so that can't be accepted.

Okay, sir.  >> Saransh Saini: Alright, so next Ethan Saini you are here again. Yeah.  >> 24DS2000071 KETAN SAINI: Yeah. Yes. I'm really sorry. I couldn't ask my question entirely because I actually forgotten how written it down. Quickly, ask them so. So first of all, you said that the data gen are",
  "So first of all, you said that the data gen are github, link can change, but I've actually  configured my docker file, my docker image to call that data gen thing from the Github Rock content link. or during runtime.

So what's your question is can you repeat?  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, so normally for task A, we have the dependency based on we can run and check which under dependencies needed and we can have it in. >> Saransh Saini: Okay.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: it's",

So if you just go back to, I guess, lecture not  yesterday? So if just go back to thirst is picture, what we did was we created itself at writing loop, in that self-rating group you can see  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Let's see. >> Saransh Saini: that jivraj. I feel demonstrated that how you can create you",
  "I feel demonstrated that how you can create you can ask LLM to  create your own code, your code and in that code, you can specify UV. What are dependencies are required,  Okay? So you will be asking the element for the code and you will be asking that enough for the dependencies as well.  Okay. And in that, and when you ask the Lnn Photos dependency so you can create a specific file which contains that, you know, the inline script which UV uses to install a dependencies, you can use, you can",

You have to create a separate file. So this is one way of doing things, okay?

Good electric.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Got yeah, 20 is see. 20 is just a soft limit. Okay, that's so that  students don't think they can. run something for a whole minute or something.

And so, Actually the issue, I'm facing knowledge that of like completed all the tasks and like everything is  working. but, I'm not understanding the Docker part, so,  >> Carlton D'Silva: A docker just watch. Thursday session. Okay. There is a Explanation of how to do the docker part, beginning, part of those day,  session itself as a docker part, and also",
  "day,  session itself as a docker part, and also tuesday's session, I think towards the one hour mark or just before that, there is also where we are discussing, how to create the docker image and how to run the application inside the docker image and then how to connect it. And how to check the end points are working. So just watch those sections.  >> ANURAG POONIA: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: on 3x or something.  >> ANURAG POONIA: which was on the 11th so like I think  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah,",
  "11th so like I think  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, yeah, that is one on 11th. That was the initial place where we  created a very simple application first to begin with just to show you how docker images are created and how you get them done. So if you do that basic thing, then it will work. And today's session earlier in the session, I had shown demonstration of the Docker an example, Docker file with some additional features in it where you install extra package. But before you do, all the",
  "install extra package. But before you do, all the complicated stuff, just get your docker image connected and working. So for that, you just watch Tuesday session, I think, like I said, it's at the round, roughly around the one normal  before that. And Then there is one thing that was missing from that, and it was to do with the data folder. But if everything is correctly, configured even that might not be necessary  because someone else on the session today said for them they didn't create the",
  "today said for them they didn't create the data folder but it was perfectly so >> ANURAG POONIA: With the empty data folders are  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry. >> ANURAG POONIA: right. I'm pretty data folder. We have to have in the director itself.  >> Carlton D'Silva: I may or may not be.

  "more robust, so maybe that's why it doesn't need explicitly creating a data for you if you can do it without explicitly, creating the data holder, that's a better off because that means your code is more robust because it might not be that, you know, maybe we don't ask you to create a data holder, but ask you to create some other folder, right? So,  if it's more robust better, but we won't expect you to create some other folder, okay? Data is specified. So you will stick with that",
  "Data is specified. So you will stick with that specification. So you can create the data folder with the right permissions before and  >> ANURAG POONIA: Okay. Okay. So and that the running the image with the API key and all is  that like already cleared in those sessions, you have just mentioned  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, just well yeah, just watch Watch those docker image creation  >> ANURAG POONIA: Yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: of the sessions.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: Ayush.  >> AYUSH KUMAR",

I haven't joined up session today. >> Carlton D'Silva: yeah, so I explained so a lot of students made have issues because they don't understand what's how  evaluation works, okay, if you go this is this is life being live stream to YouTube. If you just >> AYUSH KUMAR SHAW: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: rewind to the beginning of this size, not",
  "rewind to the beginning of this size, not exactly the beginning, but a little bit later in the session, you will see where I've explained how evaluation works. If you watch that, you will understand How to a first of all, your, how your  application gets deployed and very evaluate DOT UI and DATA-JUND.PY is used and why it is not part of your project.

Our reason for providing evaluate and data gender p, y is to show you. how our test setup will be. And so if you rewind back to earlier in this session, you will see, I've explained  everything clearly how the test setup is, I think, if you watch that it will clear your doubts about this.  >> AYUSH KUMAR SHAW: Okay, set. Sorry, one last dot is there any scope of extending the",

I've been told that there is no extension going to be grounded.  >> AYUSH KUMAR SHAW: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: but ayush, one thing I would say is this, if you watch this session from the beginning, you might actually have a good chance of finishing your project today. So watch from the beginning,  >> AYUSH KUMAR SHAW: This doubt",
  "the beginning,  >> AYUSH KUMAR SHAW: This doubt session, right?  >> Carlton D'Silva: is doubt session and then some, when it regards to small small technical things, you can always watch the previous sessions, but this doubt session will really in the few watch from the beginning. I've given an  overview. Where I've explained, how everything exactly comes together and works. And even the logical breakdown of your program.

You have to first check where the response is like, when the response comes to you, what your application is actually fetching, right? The file location. Is it accessible is the file exists on that location. Have to check that.  And once you check that, if you see that, it is the correct location. then you have to then further debug it. so, Because",

So print it out and just debug it and see what is it? Touching is the input location. Is it getting the right location? And then the second thing is, is the file exist at that location or not.  >> 24F2006749 SAKSHI PATHAK: Okay.  >> Saransh Saini: Okay.

How can I verify  >> Saransh Saini: More.  >> 24F1001895 JAYESH BANSAL: Is it not possible to just change the consumption? like,  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no.

We have been waiting in the queue also.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yeah.  >> VIKRAM S: Just have one question, sir. I'll just share my screen.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Hello, I have one question.  >> Saransh Saini: Oh, you know, you should, you should know that we have been taking  decision for the past four hours, and it has been really straining on us.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: A.",

We will try to  reply as soon as possible.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: I have only one doubt like it's pretty simple. So we are actually  having the pill package inside the Dungeon data Generation PY file. So I'm seeing some issues with respect to the dependencies for the same.  >> Saransh Saini: Are using UV using Uvid on it.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: so, Yeah, yes.  >> Saransh",
  ">> Gokul Vasudevan S: so, Yeah, yes.  >> Saransh Saini: Okay. What's what's the complications?  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: so, it's asking me to upgrade to a newer Python version or it's asking  me to use pillow package instead of that Pa Pa L package that has been  >> Saransh Saini: P a L is below.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like, when is  Googled it said like both the same but it's asking me to go for the other thing I am. Not sure. That's why I was pretty confused.  >> Saransh",
  "That's why I was pretty confused.  >> Saransh Saini: so, this was >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, so so one thing, who's speaking sorry Gokul is it.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yes.  >> Carlton D'Silva: okay, look, this data Gen and this evaluate that these are not the final versions. These are just something we provided. Just so that you guys, you know, has something to test it, we will be when we run our final  versions of it will be very robust, and it won't fail for these dependencies. Because these",
  "won't fail for these dependencies. Because these >> Gokul Vasudevan S: oh,  >> Carlton D'Silva: dependency issues are failing on data gen and evaluated and not trying to debug those. They just you,  what you should try is, try to get your code in. Don't worry about >> Gokul Vasudevan S: oh,  >> Carlton D'Silva: it because you that code will be refined  by us anki. We get no others and then you run the tests and those >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: only test limited things, we",
  ">> Carlton D'Silva: only test limited things, we will be testing a lot of other things. So these are not versions of  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Okay? Because like it was asking me  for a recent version of Python and I think I am, I have been working on 3.12 something. So, >> Carlton D'Silva: Name. Okay, but there's Jet but these >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: errors are not being generated by your code, right?  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yes, yes. So I just wanted to know even if my",
  "S: Yes, yes. So I just wanted to know even if my evaluation actually fails if I promote like afterwards.  So, that's why. Like, once I  >> Carlton D'Silva: I mean.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Good. Yeah, even if your expecting some higher version or a very recent version of Python other evaluation scripts that you are going to use, right? So that's why I just wanted to resolve the doubt.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. So I see again like I said, we will when we this is not the final  version of those",
  "when we this is not the final  version of those files. >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Not by any stretch. So  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: these will be refined and they'll be tested and then you will run them because these areas be generated by evaluate and  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yes.  >> VIKRAM S: so, just a generic >> Carlton D'Silva: See, it's also easy for you to very fun if your output is correct.  anyway?

And after that, when I try to run the evaluate dot py, all the tasks and failing, It says that it cannot.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. When did you okay, when did you join join this session?  >> VIKRAM S: What's the answer? Just  >> Carlton D'Silva: Ah, so I'm not going to answer that  question because we have answered this whole all these this particular this doubt you will understand if you watch the",
  "this doubt you will understand if you watch the session from the beginning part. Okay. We are not going to sit here till midnight  >> VIKRAM S: oh,  >> Carlton D'Silva: to solve things that have already been solved. Right, because we've been here for >> Saransh Saini: All right.  >> Carlton D'Silva: four hours. So we are going to call this to a hard stop. Okay.

But we are having some, er,  >> Carlton D'Silva: That tag AG. Anand and JK. That's all I can say because I have asked the  question and the the deadline has not been moved. Okay? So you can tag and ask them what they think I lost",
  "you can tag and ask them what they think I lost on students we have and it's currently, it is you just have to assume it's midnighter, okay? So >> Saransh Saini: Okay.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: It's not clarification if our cord is working. >> Saransh Saini: We are not going to take any more  classification, guys. If you have  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: No, no. >> Saransh Saini: any more questions.  Yeah.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: not indeed just a line. So if our cord is working fine and everything, you can",

In the core.  >> Saransh Saini: that's,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. I mean if you are if you are  applications running fine in the Docker, it will run fine for us. Yeah. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, documents. That game points and the file has been  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct. >> VIKRAM S: Up. >> TELVIN VARGHESE:",

We can like  >> Carlton D'Silva: And telvin you ask this earlier, did you not?  >> Saransh Saini: Yeah, there was someone who has this  question.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: You and is not working. That's what I have trained. Figure it out.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: So, you  >> VIKRAM S: So not sure this can ask but we can if you submit multiple times and already we provide the latest tag in",

If you have any word out this post on this course, or was this for our lecture, if you want once again. And that's highly recommended from our  side. Okay? Because we I guess we took about 100 queries in this session. Okay? So Let's close the second. Bye guys.  Carlton Candy, close. This meeting for everyone.",

  "foreign speech speech our qualities in qualities inan so hi everyone I think we have uh most of them joining in now uh but uh first of all how was I know that uh you had a mock AI one yesterday and there was a mock Ari today so just want to get a high feedback on what do you think on the Roes are they difficult are they workable did you experiment the collaborative approach where you'll have group like this course Forum or anywhere you can it it's an open book and open collaborative exam so",
  "it's an open book and open collaborative exam so which means you can collaborate with your colleagues so how was the experience over the mark uh yes sir the questions are definitely solveable but definitely not not if you try to do it alone like I guess the best approach in this uh uh test would be to uh prior to Prior decide whom you're going to collaborate with and then decide who will solve the question which question based on topics Master the topics and then approach the test I think that",
  "topics and then approach the test I think that would be optimal approach in my [Music] opinion sounds [Music] fair any other uh comments on how you are able to solve is there some uh interesting approaches you tried out over the mark uh hi sir so I am AR uh yesterday I doesn't actually get a chance to the mark one uh I'm not sure I'm a capable candidate to give a feedback but I like to share my thought um yeah so yesterday my friends were frustrated like uh this this is very uh impossible uh",
  "like uh this this is very uh impossible uh thing to complete in in the 45 minutes uh because uh the talks were very difficult they said so the 45 minutes time stamp is very difficult to achieve so we we couldn't complete in time uh so they can increase the time up to 75 minutes or or so like that yeah so like the previous guy I'm not noted his name like he said they can collaborate so we can collaborate in a team and able to solve the problems uh in a team like uh uh like six six or 10 members",
  "in a team like uh uh like six six or 10 members form a group and uh uh two or three members uh pick like two members can pick one questions and uh they can solve up to 10 and uh one or two guys can evaluate the answers uh which is taken from internet somewhere else inbt or somewhere so yeah so like I just shared my thought uh yeah thanks thanks sir today's Mar actually uh it is showing the exam has ended actually like uh yeah the today's exam it was open for it was open for 45 minutes so it has",
  "was open for it was open for 45 minutes so it has it was open at 8:00 a.m. and 8:7 and it closed no no actually what it is showing is your exam is entered on 17th November 2024 it is showing actually uh okay so did anybody have challenge in accessing the link today mock to um sir to enter the answers I had to run that strip which was given in the notification because uh like uh in the message it show it has showed that this script is used to evaluate but to input the answers itself I had to run",
  "but to input the answers itself I had to run the script so I was able to access it but I had to run the script to enter the answers itself I think you should be able to use the portal directly it is it is accessible at any point of time for check I think I I did the check this morning as well as couple of minutes back uh I understand sir but the answer box themselves were not accessible on on any question yes yes for me also the same problem but also uh it is showing that the exam is ended on",
  "also uh it is showing that the exam is ended on 17th November 2024 yeah yeah I mean this is basically the exact Roe which was there for the previous J so that will show that way but as long as you're able to check your answers and save the answers I think uh we should be able to I mean this is more of a markup you'll try to understand what it is but it's a mark and what we are trying to do is to exactly show you what the previous term questions which was launched on 17th November for the",
  "which was launched on 17th November for the previous term the exact questions there is no uh modeled questions we keeping out here what the problem is I was even unable to check my answers because the input box were you know it was not open to answer so that's why I I didn't see that for me uh did anybody else have the same problem what did any if you use the code which you like uh I think the code which is given in the mail then all those boxes are open up like if there are some input boxes",
  "are open up like if there are some input boxes which are closed but then you have to kind of tweak it in console uh yeah yeah I used it in the console and I also tried that that to but I don't know why didn't open for me so I have to check it that shouldn't be a challenge for at least for me I didn't have a problem but if that is the case Okay so as you able to load the answer I mean load the script on the console you should be able to access the uh uh portal and this portal will be available",
  "uh uh portal and this portal will be available like once you you can try it even afterwards although it shows it's ended you can still do a you can keep it open and then check the answers that is possible it's back end evaluat script will always check the answers that are submitted okay now uh jumping on so I know that we have 63 almost 63 Plus uh uh joined for this session so uh can I get a quick count of how many of them are not even able to access this portal uh maybe if you can uh chat type",
  "this portal uh maybe if you can uh chat type one in the chat window we'll get a sense of it and uh we'll try to see what we can uh work around on that specific item um if you paste it in the console yes if you paste this script in the console all the data uh buttons will be abl and you'll be able to access them sir yes is the recording of the session will be available on YouTube yeah this is streaming this is Lively streaming on YouTube so you should be able to add okay sir thank you sir thank",
  "be able to add okay sir thank you sir thank you sir now uh let's do I I I thought of having this session in a similar way how I think Arin was mentioning about how to handle the Roe so uh the current Roe Mark 2 has totally eight questions now what we can plan is let's consider the same time limit which is 1 hour so sorry 45 minutes within 45 minutes what we can try to do is I'll focus on couple of questions and I want uh couple of volunteers who can try on uh few other questions so basically if",
  "can try on uh few other questions so basically if someone can work on question number three uh you can uh have I'll have the chat window in I have the chat will open so that whenever you chat I'll be able to answer so we can have uh uh someone can work out on three which is very similar to one of the ga assignments and also uh to work on five so if someone anybody can volunteer three and five meanwhile uh we can run down through the remaining set of uh uh questions and then we have we can have",
  "of uh uh questions and then we have we can have back and forth discussions maybe I I'll park three and five for collaboration and question one and two and sorry I have done question one and two uh yeah we we'll run down through the question one two and I I we'll have three and five for collaboration and the remaining questions we'll solve and we'll come back again like at the end we'll see where we are sir you sol that forone rest all I completed ex up okay no yeah what I meant to say is I'll",
  "ex up okay no yeah what I meant to say is I'll be sharing the screen now we'll work together on SOL no like four and five I was not able to understand how to figure it so could you just do four and also like okay I'll five for the last and then I'll come back again yeah yeah okay so is my screen visible okay my screen is visible so totally there are eight questions covering up the different modules 1 to six so let's go to the first question the first question is on uh download the HTML file uh",
  "first question is on uh download the HTML file uh this is a zip folder and we'll have HTML files underneath and there are uh three sets of uh columns I mean three columns types units and price and uh our idea is to identify the ticket type which is gold and then find how many units and each unit price and to count the total uh price or the total sales for uh gold uh in the given data set and round it for two decimal so let's say you get all rows where the type is gold and there are the the the",
  "where the type is gold and there are the the the uh hindrance there is the gold is not specificed asset uh predefined or let's say Unified values it it can be upper lower or Cel case so we have to incorporate a specific logic onto that now let's see the data set uh for our for our quick scenario let me I have uh what I see is these are the different HTML files that I see and uh let's say I'm opening up the HTML this is the specific table I have silver first entry gold so so in the HTML table uh",
  "first entry gold so so in the HTML table uh file I have table one underneath I have gold under different uh uh lower upper and camel case with unit price and there are multiple tables so table one table two table three and across so my first approach would be to uh figure out tables and then within the table I'll have to figure out uh the uh individual entry and from the individual entry if that is gold I'll have as a uh sum that needs to be uh populated let me so for simplity I have downloaded",
  "let me so for simplity I have downloaded all let me open up all the fils here okay so now I have all the files so so let's say we are assuming goal sum equal to zero and then uh I'm taking a loop so here the files are between 1 to uh 10 so I'll have 1 to 11 which is I + 1 and uh open so I can parameterize the [Music] file so I'm typing but I believe everyone uh is clear with like what the section here is we are having so basically we have to open individual file here and the file can be",
  "to open individual file here and the file can be parameterized so that we can run it in a loop for each individual file so this will give us reading or opening the file uh now let's say we are taking up so HTML passer to pass the data so let's say I capture all the tables first so do find underscore all so find what tables done and okay yeah 14 tables course I can have equals to table select so how do we basically identify this so what is the table and what is the table you have to basically",
  "table and what is the table you have to basically pass the data and observe what the scenario here is so let's do this um we'll print the table so here you can see for every table section uh the uh HTML element starts with table and then for every uh uh body TR we have the gold and the units and so we have the class elements here so it's easy by reading the tables once HTML is passed we can try to understand what the HTML specific class we will need to refer and using that we'll be able to",
  "need to refer and using that we'll be able to information so what we are doing is for every individual element again I'll be having uh for each row I have to find whether that ticket Tye is gold and then if the ticket is going we have to calculate what is the uh unit ver uh unit price says number of units so here uh we are able to find the column data and from the column data let's take ticket time so uh the moment we take column data column data we see that if you if you remember the HTML the",
  "we see that if you if you remember the HTML the First Column entry was gold or silver or the different type and then we had unit and then we had the price so all zero and uh the uh first thing is we have uh challenge with uh the letters as they can be camel casys or lower or upper so let's unify that everything will uper and for check we'll also do a strip check so that it's trimming up the white spaces and we don't have any unwanted uh characters that is uh blocking is now let's say if the",
  "that is uh blocking is now let's say if the ticket type is equal to gold now I can start my procedure where I'll be finding out what is the total number of uh units for each entry and uh also now this automatically so here the units uh we are taking call data one and uh again doing uh the string uh strip we can do price I think um but for the price we want to uh take the float and we have to do a rounding of two decimals if you see in the specific section here the question was to round to two",
  "section here the question was to round to two decimals so it's ideal to round this to two decimals by the time we get it so round it by two and let's say total is equals to round units class PR two so this is again I have rounded to two let's say okay so to quickly run down through again so we are uh running a for Loop and finding out what uh each file under each file we are finding out the list of tables and from the list of table for every individual element we are taking the uh column data",
  "element we are taking the uh column data from the column data first second and third we are able to identify the ticket type and the units and price and we are calculating goals so oh what is 20206 95.7 so let's see whether that is so so this is basically how uh we can Define out uh I'll stop here any specific questions uh yeah I'm seeing the chat now okay understood so I don't see any questions I'll move on to the next one so the next one is uh there are two CSA files students and subjects and",
  "there are two CSA files students and subjects and the idea here is to identify uh so let's uh you can see that students has student ID and class so a unique identifier for each student and the class where the that for the student like where he belongs to and subjects has again two columns one is student ID and subject is basically the specific subject which they chosen now the common ID between students and subjects is basically the student ID so the question here is what is the least number of",
  "the question here is what is the least number of subjects any class has taken up list three count of subjects uh in order like from the lowest count of order uh to find the unique subjects in each class and find the unique number of unique subjects in each class then calculate the minimum of those sort them in ascending order list so there are two ways how we can handle this uh uh specific problem you can do an Excel based pivoting or we can do uh via scripting so let me first uh load the data",
  "uh via scripting so let me first uh load the data we'll first uh Lo so you can see there is student ID and the specific uh class and if you open uh subjects this is basically student ID and subject number a quick check it's been very silent am I audible everyone is able to see the screen and yes sir yes sir okay understood yeah got it so we just saw what the student ID and uh student ID is a common uh uh link between both so what we can generally do is uh use a panda's uh library and then WR to",
  "do is uh use a panda's uh library and then WR to merge both the data frames so read individual FES as data frames merge them and perform the specific operation which you wanted to do so so let's say I'm using data frame one _ CSV so one quick notice as we see here there is no single uh uh there's there's not there are multiple solutions to solve the problem it doesn't mean that everyone should fit in the single problem to solve this so you can use a different tool that's where Tools in data s",
  "use a different tool that's where Tools in data s comes into play so you can use any kind of tool as long as you're able to get the answer and uh the challenge here is how you optimiz use the tools optim in an optimal fashion if you're an expert in Excel uh you can do this in the same amount of time as you code here with respect to we we'll jump on that as well after this session so let's say we doing session on both DF and the student ID is a common ID so we have it now uh now we have to do so",
  "ID so we have it now uh now we have to do so here the ask is we have to group by the class with subjects that are unique so which means that I need to uh take subjects and uh group the subjects according to class and how find out uh I mean find out subjects that are unique uh for a specific class so this comes let's say this go b class so let's do a group b Group B so our group by should be by class because we wanted uh the class to be grouped and uh with subject but uh what we wanted to do is",
  "uh with subject but uh what we wanted to do is n unique so it's Unique count of uh uh the number of subjects and then reset so let's say now we have done the group b now we have to sort it out from the lowest order uh so that we get the first set of uh so sort values by subject asending we need sending true it can either be asending true or it can be this and then uh print sorted counts. head what we wanted is the first three so let's say I'm able to print this okay see what the challenge here",
  "to print this okay see what the challenge here student ID is okay so what we see here is uh 2 R 10g and 6 are the classes and 11 88190 are the order by which we are getting the data so this will be 11 81 and yeah we able to get this now let's say how we how we can handle this in Excel so let me open [Music] up so let's say we want to C the students and subjects here some just copying I think I faed students in a different one so now we have students in the students Tab and subjects in the",
  "students in the students Tab and subjects in the subject T now the first thing is to merge the general operation we have is lookup so let's say I have to merge class to this uh information which I have so the students ver a subject let's say I do a v lookup we lookup of student ID and then I take subject and as you know this has to be a fixed frame so we use this marker to find and it's fix it and then uh so here we are selecting A2 as element to be checked this is array from which we are",
  "to be checked this is array from which we are fetching the data back from the array it will check for the first element and then two elements from the first row is what second element from the table array is what it will pull back and false is basically it will give condition only when it is true I mean when only when it exactly matches it won't give a partial match entries so now I have all the different entries so first let's uh try to find out the scenario where we have n unique or distinct",
  "the scenario where we have n unique or distinct numbers so to get distinct number distinct classes we have to go again so once we look up the next uh consideration is on pivot table so we can go for inserting it to a pivot table I'll add this to the data model specifically add this to the data model because only when you can have for certain mathematical functions do work let me keep it in the existing worksheet so so now I have the pr table all I need is if you remember earlier we had the",
  "all I need is if you remember earlier we had the class and we had uh the subject so here we are using count of subject but count of subject will be false because that can be uh same number of students opting for uh I mean more more than one student opting for that same subject so we need n unique subjects students so we go back to the function and take distinct count so now we have the disting count let's sort the uh option here so sorting and asending disting count so we have it here so forget",
  "disting count so we have it here so forget the blanks but 1181 90 is exactly what we had used here in the section okay now uh is anyone ready with uh three want to address that or else I'll park it and move on to the next and then come back again a little later someone wanted to direct on how this has to be done can still have that direction I mean uh you can yeah speak out I'll make that correction for you so that we can keep it interact I don't want this to be like a one hour session we give",
  "want this to be like a one hour session we give uh sir yeah yeah in question number two python code you are used can you show that one yeah this is the Pyon yeah so here you have grouped by that class and students right correct class and subject yeah so that one cannot be directly pick up uh like like top three along in from the class students and code count line number seven okay yeah this is the group by yes yeah this is a list right uh this will be a group by frame it will be a it will be a",
  "be a group by frame it will be a it will be a uh the group a uh returns a value which is uh a data frame but okay uh fine yeah tell me so this will be a list yeah yeah this will be right so if you print the list itself directly we can take right can you print and right okay so the question I have is sorting has to be done so next step we just sorting the same thing uh section with uh by subject so if the question is whether you need I mean it's just the way how we C if you want we can even add",
  "just the way how we C if you want we can even add this to the uh same group section and do a print so let's say if I so you're going to get it here okay so uh nothing begins it's more like the style which you want to follow you can still use that same function over there and then reduce the number of lines okay I like I tried using like end list and got the end elements okay like in uni got then made from that I took the uni and S to the list directly I got yeah yeah makes sense yeah I mean",
  "directly I got yeah yeah makes sense yeah I mean that is true y okay then I'll move to the fourth one so finding the shortest path so let's take some time to explore on this question so what uh we are mentioned that we are operations manager from for the world career and we are trying to find out shortest path between two cities like Casablanca andsa now what are the things which we have in hand so uh we have a fleet that can fly directly between specific sites and the distance between two",
  "specific sites and the distance between two cities are calculated using H so H is nothing but uh so H is basically uh although the uh I mean any distance for metric which we calculate uh in an uh plane we always consider that the plane is flat and that is how we calculate the specific distance hav considers that Earth considers the spicity of the earth so which means that if you take two points on the earth it is not flat it's slightly uh uh spherical or obloid and uh we need to include that",
  "or obloid and uh we need to include that specific Factor so Hing basically uses that principle and then tries to calculate so not going deep into how the uh physics of uh habin but we'll jump on here uh now what we have is uh the sequence of cities that uh the uh aircraft should fly to minimize the total distance is what the requirement is now let's say what are all the different flight connections so we have uh uh flight uh uh from New York to London Tokyo to Sydney so these are all different",
  "London Tokyo to Sydney so these are all different existing flight paths and uh the next thing is we have uh the latitude and longitude to calculate the havan distance now we want to find out the answer which means that basically it will be like uh start City and end City and then find out the intermediate cities which are the shortest path for the given consideration like what is the uh given uh uh place here so okay now the first thing is how to identify this data set so I mean if you want to",
  "identify this data set so I mean if you want to check you can always get this data load it in an CSV and then still go around but uh the better other ways also you can uh go through uh uh inspect element and then find out what the specific uh data set uh these are so let's say the moment you go to network uh HR and then have it so let's see what this data set is and then try to yeah yeah so so here already we have this data in shortest path Json and cities region Json so going back to this four",
  "and cities region Json so going back to this four uh let's say uh if you want to further understand what the response is so I can see one second uh oh oh no no one second oh maybe no no I don't see this in fine this this is for the so we don't have so what we have is we have only the uh details on these cities and latitudes there is no specific J on here so the first thing is we have to go back and fix this data and have it as a CSV I think that's the only option right now it's not available as",
  "the only option right now it's not available as a specific Json object uh now we'll go back so let's take to for quicker I have already loaded them as csvs let me see if those csvs are Avil yeah so long so let's see the latl so yeah here we have the latl and uh here we have the flight paths perfect so let's first uh start reading uh the data set so we have to use H same and uh in order to find the CV uh just copy paste in Excel uh just open up an Excel just open up an Excel just open up an",
  "up an Excel just open up an Excel just open up an Excel and uh go to this page P that's it save it as CS yeah so now going to the scripting so so in order to find uh the shortest PA we do have uh uh we can use it directly using network X so let me try to implement that with network X we know we have already included pandas so from [Music] let's say I will configure the start City and the end City start City s is H automatically installed in collab uh no won't be definitely it will throw up an",
  "uh no won't be definitely it will throw up an error and we'll have to Ty install it yeah so can increase the size it's very sorry can you pleas increase the size of the text in the form Oh you mean have to zoom it yeah thanks is it better now oh yeah it's better okay so I'm reading two csvs first one is uh say uh that's CSV which is plug and then we have the so let's say we are getting the location of uh the latitude and longitude so what we saw is right now this is as work as separate uh list",
  "is right now this is as work as separate uh list so returning that as a St so let's see we get the DF based on the data frame and the city it will return yeah so we have C Andals to city and latitude and longitude Valu equals use values equals to Z also use I so this should return a specific uh based on the uh section B of an City it should be providing us the latl we can even test that little why are you using wouldn't you like if it's a function use DF only because you're using it as a",
  "function use DF only because you're using it as a variable for uh Network X where we want to to uh uh let's say even for applying H for applying H we need a a city and uh from the city we have latitude and longitude so it's better to have it as a function so that we can get the location of the function then perform the uh uh different AIS so let's say if you want to run it in Loops like have uh City one as from and city2 as uh from and two locations so just to make sure this is model if you",
  "so just to make sure this is model if you have this get function you can even run down through the list on a easier maybe uh was that like sir file name in df1 is spelling mistake okay thank you yeah so let's see if I do get log from DF 2 and let's say if I put uh so so what happens let's say now if I put Kaza Lanka I should be able to get this now consider for every time I have a from and a two so I can have a list which says from and two and I can use this function to always get the specific",
  "can use this function to always get the specific lat long and then perform the uh distance calc calculation to find out which is the shortest dist so let me work out on that and then we'll again come back if you still have uh question on that so let's say I'm calculating distance now to calculate distance I all I have to do is apply H sign between these two yeah I mean this already gave it but apply H between uh uh two specific uh sections so here if you see all I need to do is in the df1 which",
  "if you see all I need to do is in the df1 which is basically the paths in the df1 I can take it will be from one to although this is giving auto correction but you can still do it so so from and to will be my uh uh specific uh data which I get from uh uh df1 and using the df1 uh data I have to calculate get the location uh based on df2 which is the second data frame I think now we are able to understand why we have this function so with this online we'll be able to find out or apply this",
  "online we'll be able to find out or apply this function across the row so immediately once this uped our df1 will have the distance with respect to each uh section here df1 so now we have the distance calculated I have Lambda and apply are something specific which you do in alas data frame you can have a function def so here apply function applies across different rows so for individual row we can apply the function so that we can calculate the respective distance now let's move on to uh",
  "the respective distance now let's move on to uh calculating or creating a network and then uh finding out the shortest part so to create a network so we need uh uh Network X yeah so we can create NX from yeah P AG list all I need to do is I have to create bf1 where source is uh equals to from and uh Target is equals to two and the edge attribute is going to be the distance so I can create the network and to find the shortest path shortest path again uh NX shortest path so G is my graph and uh",
  "again uh NX shortest path so G is my graph and uh the network so I have this I'll see what we do here so we'll have yeah Source equal to sh City basically to find the shortest part the attributes which we ask source and destination or source and Target so the source will be uh difference but just to give Clarity to the code so Source equal to start city which we have defined and uh uh Target equal to n city so this is basically what we have here and we equal the distance now let's say we are",
  "and we equal the distance now let's say we are printing shortest path yeah okay okay let's do this now we have kasablanca istan buul Athens Rome Vienna Prague Berlin and Vara these are the eight uh list and as we travel across this we'll be able to identify the shortest Network I believe there are visualizations in uh the network graph for yeah so let's say you can even do NX I'm not sure work now but let me see the next draw [Music] and one it should be G labal to and definitely I think it",
  "it should be G labal to and definitely I think it will requ map plot so and then basically I'll draw and to show so let's say whether we are able to see yeah here you can see the map so this is the entire network which we had and the shortest SS maybe Kasa bla starts here and then we travel across uh what have istan buul so istan buul I can see Rome here maybe I'll [Music] remove and do another thing which is uh list okay you can color the edges but I think yeah I hope it is clear but if you",
  "but I think yeah I hope it is clear but if you want to remove the labels and see you can still see the graph here so this is the entire graph Network and let me see so this is there so F so let's try this out so this is what we are getting as an answer but we haven't tried it out in the portal so let's go back to the portal and incorrect so let's see yeah yeah yeah so the codes yep that's that so this is clear now five I think we said we'll come back again I'll quickly run down through the",
  "come back again I'll quickly run down through the remaining which is there and then we'll come back again to five and uh so move to six so correlation is again so can show me the code again oh yeah so basically we are using this specific df1 where where you have from and to and you have to calculate the distance of these two uh cities to understand the shortest part I mean just the H distance of path so we uh in order to understand that we need the lat long of individual City so using lat long",
  "the lat long of individual City so using lat long indivual City we defined a custom function to calculate uh or get the location use a Lambda function to find out have same distance between the two cities that are in from and two and we list out all the specific distances now create a graph with network x uh find out uh fix out the edges as source and uh and use distance as a attribute and then finally find out shortest part these are shortest PA is basically default inbuilt algorithm in X",
  "PA is basically default inbuilt algorithm in X networks so so the next thing is on uh calculating uh correlation I think this must be something very simple so let me first load the Json data so calculating Json okay is it loaded yeah is loaded here just if I want to see it can see that there's a and b and different uh entries for a b so uh pretty much straight forward you have the or correlation function in pandas which can basically provide you the correlation function all you need to do is",
  "the correlation function all you need to do is read the Json there is no nesting here so we can read it directly so let's say I'm using culate correlation Jon so now you'll have read that so now the car function will basically give a correlation uh table uh okay you calulate so this gives a correlation table basically it will give a versus a is highly correlated one and a versus B is minus. 9688 so if we go back to the question the question is calculate p and correlation coefficient and round",
  "calculate p and correlation coefficient and round it off to uh three numericals three in decimal places so this is going to be so this is direct way by which you can get it and uh on the other hand we can also uh read it uh I get the Json read it out uh we can use uh the functions in Excel as well to calculate this so I think uh yeah you can use Excel to calculate what uh the uh Excel has again linest and uh correlation uh specifics here so you can use functions over that so move on to the next",
  "use functions over that so move on to the next question which is uh du BB so here uh we are connected to a table called sales and having 10,000 rows three columns so time stamp category and amount so there are only three columns here the time stamp stamp says when the sale occurred it can start from starting week so we have a start date and categories basically there are different types of category Electronics clothing and multiple other categories and then we have a sale value as a number",
  "and then we have a sale value as a number these are the three entries uhi yeah hi good evening sir yeah I'm sorry to interrupt sir before you move on to the next question I was not able to understand the part in the previous question sir the PS and correlation coefficient yes sir how did you get that Json like we were doing that coding how did we get that Json you just click it and download the Json oh oh oh my God sorry sorry sorry S I think I missed the point sorry sir okay yeah I got it",
  "I missed the point sorry sir okay yeah I got it thank you no problem you can so whatever is under the under the blue uh clickable button you you'll just click and download the Json and it's basic Json format you just saw that it's basic Json doesn't have a neep structure so you can always directly use read Json and get it in the pure format only if it is lested you have to work upon creating or differentiating each Json Loops yes sir thank you so much so now going back we did not discuss",
  "you so much so now going back we did not discuss question six right uh we just completed question six okay sorry question five I yeah question five we have we have we have yeah I said like three and five we'll wait until someone want to collaborate on their findings uh if not then we'll finally figure out how that works yeah so coming to this uh duck DB SQL query uh the query is to find total sales amount of each product category proved by hour so we have a time stamp but we have to PIV it by",
  "so we have a time stamp but we have to PIV it by hour first condition so aggregate the total sales amounts into hourly intervals now we have a time stamp we have to aggregate into hour now the next thing is show total sales amount per category uh per hour to the nearest integer so which means that we have to take the total say uh and fill the missing comos with zeros and find out the nearest integer which means that nearest non Nal value is what we have to find out and order the rows",
  "is what we have to find out and order the rows chronologically by H and column in any order so that is fine we can H we can use it by H that is good so what we have a result is we have it for one day so from hour zero to hour 23 we should uh be getting data for three categories Electronics Home Goods and clothing and uh uh okay so let's see how we uh work on this so okay so we'll start with the query let's do the select query and uh first thing is um we can use extract from so extract this",
  "is um we can use extract from so extract this basically extract the specific uh uh section from the uh time St so we have to extract the how from the time stamp so you can use extract from uh how from cast time St as time St as H so let's say I'm doing H here so and the next condition is I have to make sure that nonl value is added to every individual set so there are three uh categories which we have so let's say I'm doing um sum of case when uh category equals to home goost amount so I can",
  "uh category equals to home goost amount so I can repeat this here uh so it should be home goods then uh vol [Music] taking it from sales the table where our category should be Electronics so I need to group by hour for the individual time stamps I'm extracting only the time stamp frame from that uh table uh and I also have to order it by so do you think this will work okay [Music] gu time St oh take okay no uh time stamp same right so we have time stamp as a function here time stamp is correct",
  "stamp as a function here time stamp is correct category is correct and amount is correct so let's see oh select okay so now that error is result so now uh you need to add explicit type casts right so some decimal some okay so now this is because because what we obser is we need to get the non null Value First non null value so in order to get the first non null value we use something called qus okay so now we have ques some case when category home good and end LS zero okay so understood so I",
  "home good and end LS zero okay so understood so I think uh the difference here is we have to find out if there is nulls and if there is null then has to be replaced by the uh fill the missing combinations with zeros I think that's where we are using col okay so can you show okay yeah so you were using some right you started using qu after that yeah yeah obviously I was waiting so someone can tell that Co has to be used so I was waiting whether that will work so since no one mentioned I brought",
  "will work so since no one mentioned I brought back that because Co is basically gets the sum and then if there's some specific value then use value or replace it zero next can I scroll down yeah sure let's see what Co function basically does so let see here again so when you have coil is n n n and the specific value so it return returns non n value in the list so provided we don't mention anything in the qu function and let's say if we want to fill the nulls with zeros then basically yeah it",
  "fill the nulls with zeros then basically yeah it Returns the first non vales MH and move on to the eth one so for the eighth question uh did anybody try and they got the result I wanted someone to explain what they have tried and how they got the result yeah sir I got error okay so what what did you try what did what was the yeah I used one prompt and then enter my a AI proxy okay I got error no you got error or you got uh the answer I got error sir oh you got the error I was asking if someone",
  "sir oh you got the error I was asking if someone got the answer and they try out sorry sorry okay okay I see we can create uh so there is AIT metal so you Tred say only yes or no do humans need oxygen to bre so did you try this out and then you got [Music] uh yes sir I got the answer perfect so there are multiple ways by which you can um make sure that an llm uh can be asked to uh work as yes so consider like giving out uh exactly I was about to say this writing a poem about five years old so",
  "say this writing a poem about five years old so you can even have uh a character with the name yes let's say you have a character name yes and you can explain about the character what the character it's like a fiery tale and then finally ask who is the protagonist of the story then it's going to say yes and there are other ways of even mentioning is the other ways would be like uh uh specifically use Cipher and uh so you know about the ciphers right so ciphers basically uh shift the letter by",
  "right so ciphers basically uh shift the letter by three and then you will get the answer so essentially instead of y s you write the last three letters before y three letters before E and three letters before s and then mention that is a cipher uh tool and you have to find out the answer of that cryptic word and then you can find what the cryptic word is going to be so there are different ways by which you can uh uh get this detail yeah Andrew yes yes sir would you be releasing the code for",
  "yes yes sir would you be releasing the code for this session sir uh I don't think that should be a challenge but let me quickly check this out and then I don't think it should be a challenge anyways this is streaming now everybody would have seen it I I'll see it and if there's we can have a discourse post and then uh have this uh you or you can just share the collab notebooks yeah exactly exactly on the discourse portal I can share it yes sir you can just post it I'll put it on the yes so I",
  "you can just post it I'll put it on the yes so I think for the prompt uh it must be pretty much Clear like you can try these different prompts and uh uh different uh use cases mention especially uh stories or uh Tales or different ways of uh uh password or scrips Cipher so you can use it oh uh I mean Cipher is basically so if you see this is cipher cryptography so basically if you want to inter so you create if you want to create an uh uh name author you can have a different Cipher metric and",
  "author you can have a different Cipher metric and then add a different logic here I think if you have watched movie National I think there Nicholas Cage we'll have that Cipher mode and we'll just try to work around but similarly you can you can Define whatever Cipher text and Cipher you can read about this it's uh it's a cryptographic method and you can Define like this is what so let's say if you want to have VR discovered say save yourself so this basically goes as uh F and D so you can see",
  "this basically goes as uh F and D so you can see that F and D points the array F and D points to W so if you have the cipher text you'll be able to point out and understand what the answer is so similar to that if I want to say I'll crypt the word and I'll say this is the cipher array find out g g uh XA and GD it will show it will say s okay now we move on uh so sir how do we use this Cipher in the model h no this is more like you define a cipher so it's not a model it's basically a cryptic",
  "so it's not a model it's basically a cryptic tool like how we how we say that uh yes can be a character in a f tale or a story you can Define yes based on you can tell the llm say that this is my uh substitution array this is what I'm having in my substitution array now this is my Cipher text can you tell what my uh uh final uh uh Crypt is so sir uh it means we have to put this Matrix can that the llm yeah exactly so let's say um I mean uh I think the basic one is yes sir if you can just",
  "I think the basic one is yes sir if you can just demonstrate how we can use this method because this seems really good so here the C are one second yeah I let me also brush up things here so the Cesar one is the easiest one it will basically uh simply and oldest one yeah so this is basically shift three letters exactly so let's say letter A becomes D so if you want to say uh let's say if you want to populate uh let's say Roe so now Roe will be uh let's go back to the so if you see a will become",
  "let's go back to the so if you see a will become D B will become e so which means that uh you will have uh so y will become B so that's what they have here right y will become B and uh e will become H so let's say if I want to type yes I'll give uh b h and yes yes is going to be V so if you say uh we so this is my Cipher text find out the uh uh what does this relate to or how does that uh uh yeah how find out what the cipher text says so sir it means that we have to say that we are using Caesar",
  "that we have to say that we are using Caesar Cipher exactly I have to give this word and then it will say with the rotation so rotation basically it goes with the rotation three you can even go with rotation one you can say I'm building a new Cesar Cipher with rotation one which means that every letter will be rotated by one so in this case I'm getting a cipher text which is is f and D so what is the uh what is the encrypted information then it will say yes right say this is a very smart",
  "it will say yes right say this is a very smart approach sir we often use this in our aptitude thank you okay so moving back I think we have question number five and uh we have question number three so question number three uh would anyone want to try this out I know that do you want I know that this is a part of the Roe G GA how do we uh enhance or allow that uh there's no answer box here so how do we introduce uh box just consider that an RO and let's say I don't know the answer you supporting",
  "let's say I don't know the answer you supporting someone and try to collaborate yeah please V vgis yeah so initially I will inspect the word where what is Jason body that we can inad using like control shift I okay so I'm going to do control shift I okay then so directly it will come then go to the elements elements in the shift area now click on the top menu left corner inspect icon will be in the elements consoles and all is right in the site inspect icon is there if you can see in that left",
  "inspect icon is there if you can see in that left side itself if you go top to top top yeah that icon click on that go to the line number what is that J yeah that line yeah click on that one that is clicked below you have the stale boxes right yeah no in the in inspected below if you see you have the Styles yep yep yeah disable like pointers and uh op in the area box the second tab second uh line yeah disable those two yeah and Below one also just click on yeah so now it's been disabled now",
  "just click on yeah so now it's been disabled now again scroll down M you have the display and N right just just not not that one just just yeah displ just un that one yeah it will be enabled just try clicking I think you have UNT the some color something else it should come okay so basically uh for me game yeah I think that works so this should be the way I'm in [Music] and you can reload the page that text area should be input this AI think is H like I tried the Caesar Cipher it did not work",
  "H like I tried the Caesar Cipher it did not work uh Caesar Cipher didn't work okay I me uh you see that last disclaimer we have right so as long as llm says yes case is you'll be correct uh carefully if you get the correct answer submit and don't change it so uh if you constantly use an llm llm has this hallucination so although it is capable of answering questions it's not providing the same answer every time you prompt it again so that's how they do find doing and you have hallucinations with",
  "do find doing and you have hallucinations with respect to LS so let's say even if you type this again with a different context and add much more data uh using the cipher you can see some it it might respond back and also it varies with different models so M model are basic or Lama 3.1 so each model has a different uh interpretation and because of the training uh with which we had that uh okay so I think question number three um will be straightforward where right now we just unblocked the so",
  "where right now we just unblocked the so text M so we have [Music] um there somebody sir you can just click on that Json box inspect the Json body Json body now change the St no no ST is the first Icon by default yeah I'll do it again so call to the top it's in top only I think wait wait one minute I think again you missed that [Music] correctly yeah expand icon itself in elements if you see there elements top top top top they explain that there expand and select like that text area now you",
  "expand and select like that text area now you disable the yeah second tab second one OPAC and pointers here disable both then scroll down dis play display n yeah and disable uh delete that disable in the in elements itself delete that one okay yeah now it should work now it works yeah maybe uh yeah this is basically you can use the same discourse Forum if anyone want to basically Ro is work with this way so you can have collaborative effort where someone might not know this completely and you",
  "someone might not know this completely and you can support them by providing directions so that they can go to the next stage where they can answer the specific question now jumping back to this question so I think this is uh pretty much straight for where uh we just have to provide a prompt and uh I hope uh can someone share the prompt that you have used so it's basically you have to put uh the specific Json body here there is nothing to be called back I'll look in for the chat see if okay or",
  "back I'll look in for the chat see if okay or else we can even go ahead with the just say using model and let me someone want to try this out Json body uh for the uh model y I see VAR name so so let's see we are using this uh this is not closed I guess okay Arian approach of inspect work yes did this work and I still see that uh I think it's broken due to limit in oh okay okay okay okay so here let's say model we are mentioning GPT 40 mini and the message we are saying the role is basically the",
  "message we are saying the role is basically the system role and content is responding Json and uh for the user role we are requesting to generate 10 random addresses in us and uh some of the other structured inputs which are providing are uh uh the objects and the fields that we need to enter in so address which is type array and description list of random addresses and items and zip uh ZIP should be again type numeric right properties to false [Music] okay we destion address object in the",
  "[Music] okay we destion address object in the database properties address what else you need to add here yeah you may want to add the additional properties first let me just quickly check the Jon body sir iing yeah yeah so thanks uh one second so let's see model GPT for many messages we have the system role which is respond to Json and the user role we are asking to generate 10 random address in US response format we are taking Json schema as a respon response format and uh okay the type is and",
  "response format and uh okay the type is and the response details are basically name address as one field and the address schema will be address object to insert to database properties okay and we are mentioning the uh you have added zip here okay zip code of the city and City type and City address and then longitude and long and then finally the additional properties uh we have to put as false so what is the challenge here State Property I think question is different for you oh okay okay okay",
  "question is different for you oh okay okay okay yeah for me for me it's actually State longitude yeah so you can directly change the state to string then yeah I'll just change the city to state no still order will be missing right wait one second so this should be address State and longitude yeah so okay zip is not yeah or uh in the in interest of I think uh you get that uh logic here basically uh let me figure out what the challeng is and then maybe I'll post it again in discourse for the",
  "maybe I'll post it again in discourse for the specific item uh basically you have to have that structure Json structure which provides response format and the the uh uh specific system can uh system role user role and then the response format and the uh specific format structure which is requested here so I I'll just fix this out and it it'll be specific for each of you and I hope this was not challenging for anybody uh sir for me actually I got the same question as G so I directly soled it ah",
  "the same question as G so I directly soled it ah okay okay but anyways I think that's more of a structuring so maybe just spend time on structuring that the main problem is the time yeah of course I think we have crossed one 30 minutes right so that's our collaboration workset so at the beginning I said split out three and five to different section or split out one and two and then work around so by the time when I when I asked someone want to try a three and five it was actually 45 or 46",
  "to try a three and five it was actually 45 or 46 somewhere around that time so it's all about collaboration as well as making so is it is it like recommended that if if if the questions are almost similar in approach we kind of split in teams and solve individual questions and then kind of see ideally it will be like how you solve the problem so the reason why we have these markups is basically to get you a sense of how uh the Roes are so that you can devise a solution right now the solution is",
  "can devise a solution right now the solution is uh something like the get location function and so somebody else will be getting another start City and end City so if you are able to fetch this function and then share it to any anybody on everyone on this is approach and you can try this approach understanding this approach and then work it out anybody can work it out so as long as you're able to build this model code you can uh most of them can uh be able to complete like if you split across",
  "uh be able to complete like if you split across and then try even try working around uh you'll be able to uh your code should be model so that it can handle the specific use cases so start thinking about scripting in a model function or parameterized functions do not use everybody can kind of use those parameters exactly one more sir so these questions are like similar to GS where we can check it out and save it out so if this is a fure uh like we can at least save some some questions answer so",
  "can at least save some some questions answer so if this is the strcture for actual Ro also uhhuh then at least some people can save it like default save if you enabled it while writing the answer itself it will be automatically saved or not like that you mean from the portal yeah portal itself we have to click the save button right yeah the portal basically when you click save it records your click yeah it saves right so can we have a toggle button where uh we can have an option auto save and",
  "where uh we can have an option auto save and manual saving uh we are working on that yeah because someone is like expert and he knows everything is like Ely he can enable that auto saving so even if you write the type the wrong answer he will use lose the data but still he can reload right see auto save is more like uh when you say auto save it's not something controll at a server it's control at the client level so autosave is more like a client function but uh understood we we will will focus",
  "function but uh understood we we will will focus on that yeah we'll focus on because that will be easier because if anyone like misses to save it because of the pressure of the Roe then he will lose full monks right no uh yeah totally understand Point valid we'll take it up and uh uh yeah we'll keep you posted on that like uh yeah I I'll quickly uh run down through this in the interest interest of time I'll quickly run down through the uh fifth question and then we'll see how we can handle this",
  "and then we'll see how we can handle this so the fifth question uh is the only one which is remaining yeah it's so uh here uh we are again uh from the same career and trying to do uh have business across 62 franchises uh giving each region all cers from inside and what we are trying to do here is we have latitude and longitude like given new requests there there are five latitude and longitude we have and these are the franchise numbers so one franchise comes under these section so which means",
  "comes under these section so which means that uh these are the cities you have lat long and anything within that region will fall under this franchise uh let's say you have warsa Helsinki sta Moscow and Istanbul so that forms a franchise so consider this as like uh polygons and any if uh the particular lat long Falls within the polygon you just have to uh work you can understand that this is a franchise that you have to work now we are able to identify what the polygon is now any point inside a",
  "what the polygon is now any point inside a region is served by corresponding franchise assume Earth is flat here we are not using any H right answer are a sequence of franchise number supported by the Comm so here now the question is how you you have to identify given a franchise and it edges you have to figure out the polygon and next thing is the given latitude longitude you have to find out if that falls within the uh given poly so you can use something called shapely geometry so there is",
  "use something called shapely geometry so there is something called shapely geometry let me quickly take this out so and and uh import this if you remember we check that these two data were available as Json from the uh uh direct uh portal and uh downloaded these Json so let me quickly take up these Json so so you see this is the regions Json and you have that cities uh and uh the specific polygon so each Fran and its uh uh code we have it here so let me try to open it up uh for this also you",
  "so let me try to open it up uh for this also you did used Excel or something how did you get the region Json uh from the uh okay from uh yeah so from the network I can do so I see this is a regions Json okay okay okay nice so you can just open it in a new tab and then uh get this entire data so okay regions and uh data equals to so here uh let's take data so I'll have uh from the data I can see there are points but uh the catch here is let's see there is cities and uh what are the other things",
  "there is cities and uh what are the other things we have we must have regions see we have cities here yeah we have cities and regions so if you see Delhi musket these are the regions and their respective lat long or Ian are their lats are available as points underneath so let me go back and you have cities as well here so let's go back here PES uh dat [Music] okay so we cities and regions now I think uh once we do it let's say uh um we'll see what is Regions so in a region you'll have all these",
  "is Regions so in a region you'll have all these cities in place so we saw this uh yeah we saw warsa Helsinki MOS and isan right so that is the region or the polygon which we are looking at and if I take uh cities so these are individual lat long for the cities so these two are available uh now I have to create a polygon or a coordinate using this region so let's start so for region in let's say we need to find region coordinate so reg coordinates list and uh I just take the coordinates for",
  "list and uh I just take the coordinates for individual City so for City in region region coordinates up okay uh so up so we are what trying to do here is we are appending City 0 and City 1 so basically trying to get the coordinates yeah c one now uh we create polygon using coordinates and if region polygon dot contains the request point so that is basically what we are going to introduce the specific uh latl which is requested okay so now [Music] um I region number anywhere okay so I'll I have",
  "um I region number anywhere okay so I'll I have to take I have to Loop this for every individual region number so so region number is nothing but the polygon let's say if Delhi is one polygon and Delhi Delhi list is one and the warsa is other one so let's say I'm defining region number one and by the end of this for Loop I'm updating the next polygon so which means in the for Loop for every region it will find out whether that falls in that region or else it updates to the next region and the",
  "or else it updates to the next region and the regions are numbered in one two uh in the orderly fashion you see here I think uh we have that in the right order 1 2 three and everything so we have that list now let's say what you're trying to do here is for every list we have the cities and the coordinates so we are creating a polygon with this coordinate and polygon is basically in geometrical area and if this latitude and longitude Falls within that geometrical area we want to identify what",
  "that geometrical area we want to identify what franchise it is basically the regional number so we are doing a for Loop and every for Loop it will find out whether this latitude longitude Falls in this polygon if yes it will give this number else it will update region number plus one and then move to the next polygon let's say the request Point okay pointal to so let's say this is my request Point based on my condition this is the first request point I have and uh if I try to run this out uh",
  "point I have and uh if I try to run this out uh okay what I uh this is cities and cities one yeah so this is a complete logic so we are creating a geometry and from the geometry we are identifying whether the point is lying within the geometry so this Den said the 263 59 is basically in franchise 62 let's say what is this data so this is showing up in map let's say in map if I zoom up I can see that this falls under Western Sahara so somewhere in the norn African PL around here so let's see the",
  "the norn African PL around here so let's see the franchise 62 Leo Deo Akra and kasablanca so this is the closest uh so let's say rioo will be here so rjo is here if I'm not wrong in Brazil R Jiro so R Jiro Spain kasablanca and uh that is Akra lban so probably Lisbon should be here and see where is so just find the directions oh yeah Ghana so here it is so now yeah here it is so you can understand this structure right so basically we have a polygon here R Geno Acra Lisbon Casablanca and then you",
  "here R Geno Acra Lisbon Casablanca and then you have this closed polygon the specific Laton will fall under this polygon and it will return the this logic will return you the number which is 62 similarly you can run down all the numbers for individual uh section and then add the detail here to get this answer okay I think we have uh run 40 minutes more uh beyond our regular Stud I'm going to I'm going to stop sharing any questions before yes sir this question I did not understand it oh okay so",
  "this question I did not understand it oh okay so I'll take some more time so now consider this plane which is R Geno Akra Casablanca and Lisbon so what they trying to say is these are the edges or the cities under uh for the 62 so it's like a square polygon okay yeah okay it's different yeah okay fine so it's a polygon basically it can be any shape it can be a so which means that these are the edges of that shape now if any latitude the Five Points which are given to you if that falls under the",
  "which are given to you if that falls under the polygon you have to give give the specific number which is that 62 or the uh the franchise number now we just check that this is the the answer or like yeah this is the latitude which I have which is 26 point and minus33 and uh based on the script which we just wrote create this is the point which we have uh we can even try another one so let's say we are trying this 48 and no no one minute one minute so you are taking that point right yeah so if I",
  "so you are taking that point right yeah so if I have like um uh I have an outside for Loop in the 12th line okay okay so where I will have a list where the point as a lole and each point if I run all the fire lines exactly that is correct that is correct yeah that with that you'll be able to get the complete list I just pointed out can you show me like how I I did not get the point how to do that you mean you didn't get the point as in no no here like uh first 13th line is there right question",
  "like uh first 13th line is there right question yeah no 133 line 13 for okay yeah you are iterating over each region correct yeah correct right so what happens is okay first is uh for every region in the region we are taking the region coordinates list what we are trying to do here is we are first trying out the regions each individual City latitude and longitude from that list okay yeah from so City Z is latitude and City one is longitude so from latitude and longitude we are creating a",
  "so from latitude and longitude we are creating a polygon using this region coordinates so let's say region coordinates is an empty list now under each region we'll have list of cities so for that reason the list of cities I'm going to up lat long for each individual so if if I go to it's already in the list right that's what I was I could not understand which one it's already in the regions list right we have okay so you what is yeah could you print that regions and list regions will basically",
  "that regions and list regions will basically have only the franchise list so you see this is Delhi Mumbai K this is the region this is region two the franchisees are the second order which we have it's city is right now the franchise that's what no this is Regions now if you go to cities cities will have individual City and it's lat long okay uh can you go to the question yeah yeah see there only like cities is showing right that's what me totally understand so cities latitude and longitude now",
  "understand so cities latitude and longitude now if you're able to fix this as a single CSV and then separate that as a one data frame then you can directly use that data frame Al together all you need to do is you have to forward fill or make sure that all these come under one franchise or one region and from that you have to populate each individual polygon so it's since you've taken it from Json from Json I have this structure As Cities and regions separately the Json which I have it will",
  "regions separately the Json which I have it will have regions and cities did you get that Json itself uh using inspect elements and then run so that you get it in the network tab I just showed it uh in the beginning okay no no in the question there is no region that's what I was wondering yeah I mean see very simple as I mentioned anytime when you have a data in uh web portal you can always figure out the end Source data if it's a table or if it is uh you can find out the structure of the",
  "if it is uh you can find out the structure of the element by which it is represented so immediately when you have this you can try it out and see whether what is a Json object so if you read the Json object it is split into cities and regions from a Json perspective if you take it from the front end copy paste it in a CSV that's alog together a different scenario there you don't need to split into cities and uh regions then it will be a different scenario this all individual so if you copy it",
  "scenario this all individual so if you copy it in CSV you will have franchise one and for the next eight entries or seven entries you will have single rows all having Deli you can do uh text to columns convert latitude longitude and you can do a forward fill and then make it all once then it'll be uh checking like if as long as this is one uh run this Loop and then find out what the different lat long for each City each franchise or each region is and then move to the next one so there are",
  "is and then move to the next one so there are different ways you can handle it based on the data which okay okay fine fine so okay so this is Regions and cities I understood okay exactly so from a structure which we have uh here I have regions which will be Delhi Mumbai and Kaku all these regions and underneath cities I have each individual latl so basically I have to run this in two loops and then find out what is the individual coordinates and then create a polygon and next thing is check",
  "and then create a polygon and next thing is check simply whether that polygon is within contains within that I mean requested point is contain within the okay got it so yeah we have to close this session uh I hope this was interesting yeah yes show me how did you get can you show the code once hello sir yes sir could you just share the collab link just copy paste it in the chat now before just save it and I'll just down I'll just like yeah thank you [Music] okay um this will be available on",
  "you [Music] okay um this will be available on YouTube it's still streaming and I'll share the collab link over here and also in discourse yes sir system is okay we'll wind up the session here I'll uh just wait for this link thank you so much sir for the session yeah I'm Shing the link but anyways uh my system is stuck and I not able to access provide access to everyone I'll just provide the access once it's back yeah okay and if there's further questions please have it ready we have like markup",

  "YouTube you could just simply go ahead with this and you know just access the record okay thank okay so let's get started uh guys uh okay so this is our data set and let's have a look at it by the way guys did someone manage to get the data from this I managed to get the data but I wasn't able to collect the answers because first I tried with tabula it was a mess so the last thing I did was I just uh used Excel I opened an Excel uh file I imported using that everything got imported but then the",
  "using that everything got imported but then the first row thing was messy so if I knew what was going to happen I would just Import in Excel then export to CSV then use in a python note okay uh I expected using the pevious plumber to the yeah so that's that's actually that's a good approach to exed using PDF plumber because the thing with taba is that it's not much compatible with spaces okay so if you just go ahead and look into this data set you will see that there are breaks here okay so",
  "you will see that there are breaks here okay so there are breaks in this entire table so tabula is sometimes not able to you know you know it's not able to recognize these gaps and make certain Arrangements uh to account for these gaps as well but PDF Lumar is something which will actually you know it will just uh leave these gaps uh and it will just let's say if we are at this row it will just SP through this one and if it's see if it if it's able to see that okay so there is a gap over here",
  "able to see that okay so there is a gap over here it will just uh run through this row and leave it and go to the next so that's the thing that PDF plumber does and uh over here the solutions that we going to show you guys we will be showing you how you can do it using PDF rather than tabula because even I tried it using uh try to do it using tabula and of course it f visably because that's what tula's nature is okay it's not much compatible with these these kinds of stuff yes it was a mess",
  "with these these kinds of stuff yes it was a mess completely yeah absolutely it's going to be it's not exactly a mess I would say uh for me it passed through the first two pages of the PDF but the third page was an entire mess because then it was kind of considering this uh polar name uh as a column name okay that was what was creating the problem even if you try to using try to do it using tabula then it will be able to for the first two pages but not for the third page that's where the",
  "pages but not for the third page that's where the problem arises that's where PDF plumber comes to us uh to our save to save us okay any other attempts at extracting the data set using some other library or some other tool or any other you know kind of uh just go to a website and try to convert it to an Excel because these kind of tools are actually available on the web you simply put your PDF file and they will just return the Excel uh back to you so was there anyone who tried that I tried it",
  "you so was there anyone who tried that I tried it out okay so how was the experience yeah PDF to excel directly tried in website okay not sure whether it's cor correctly or not but so you did it using the website right yeah website okay okay okay all right so uh were you able to get all the data on this first page and second page also third page what you able to do that using that website uh I did not check it because it was like able to extract like things but uh due to the tension I did not",
  "like things but uh due to the tension I did not pro check it okay but I hope next okay okay so uh let's look at this first question and get started so this is our data set uh this is our is this the one this is the one yeah okay this is a PDF file and we have to first of all extract each and everything out of it okay so uh let's just go ahead and extract it using Python and uh then perhaps we will look at what all stuff they are asking us okay so I will be importing import okay firstly have to",
  "I will be importing import okay firstly have to select a kernel that's a virtual environment import PF Lumber okay and now I guess the Cod was something like this open PDF plama okay it was like uh EDF l. open and then the file's name okay uh I have downloaded the file uh I guess it was uh okay downloaded once again okay so it's right here I will download it and I feel stupid this uh aobi tool converted it in two minutes Adobe tool huh what's the name of that tool just search this Adobe L PDF",
  "name of that tool just search this Adobe L PDF to Excel PDF to excel okay I I'll I'll share you the link two minutes everything and it's able to everything is gaps as well okay that's very interesting uh I should have just used this then we could spend the next 40 minutes to actually solve the question yeah let's put this file into Excel and let's look at the results okay uh let's see stop here it is okay so it has converted uh the first page also the second page so there are 67 entries uh okay",
  "the second page so there are 67 entries uh okay and I suppose that should be some blank entries as well I think it is remove yeah exactly everything it has given us each and everything even it has given us the columns as well yeah so guys uh you know this is what happens so the first thought when it comes when comes when you have been given a PDF file that comes to mind is that okay I have to use tabula and this okay so the first thought is using Tula or PDF plumber to do this but the thought",
  "Tula or PDF plumber to do this but the thought that doesn't cross our mind is that we can just simply give it to a tool on the web and it will be able to do that so when you are in the RO you should also consider this fact that there are multiple tools there are uh you know extraordinarily accurate tools present on the web which can actually parse your entire data how no no matter how bad the entire data formatting is okay so whenever you're doing that Ro always keep in mind that you should",
  "doing that Ro always keep in mind that you should first check some for some tool okay and I would recommend you guys that uh before uh before heading into the Roe just keep a kind of Arsenal of all these codes so just like I have kept over here just like I have kept over here this is my entire Arsenal for these codes but you should keep an arsenal of these websites as well okay so whenever you are given some data just simply pass it to uh website and it will be able to extract everything okay",
  "and it will be able to extract everything okay so what we're going to do is we are going to use this data no need to use PDF plumber now okay because that's not the uh because when in Ro we don't have to if it's easy to do we can simply do okay so I'll just close this yeah definitely save it okay so it's asking for doent recovery pan just a second guys okay so uh okay so what is this plumber also works ra because we do not know if plumber also works and it works pretty well but the thing is",
  "works and it works pretty well but the thing is that it removes those break points okay so if this is my code so if this is my file then PDF plumber will just truncate these lines which are being split into uh you know different pages so that's what you have to do manually and over here we have given you just three pages and if we had given you let's say a PDF file of 100 Pages then it would been a nightmare for you guys it manually right yes so so instead of doing this instead of using PDF",
  "so so instead of doing this instead of using PDF plumber you can always use these kind of tools but always remember that you have to validate your data as well okay so uh I want to view these files later okay where is it I CL closed it I need to paste it in my vs code and where is it uh here is it okay all right so let's validate it once okay so over here at 200 2 2256 we should have 2 okay okay okay so here it is all right so the thing is let me open it up in where is it where is it where is",
  "me open it up in where is it where is it where is it where is it okay the file okay so uh it should be somewhere right uh is it here is it so it should be 200 2,256 okay 2,256 and here is the 2257 okay but the thing is that it has split it into different rows okay that's not what we are expecting so the only thing that we have to rectify over here is that this District name this District uh everything so it's coming in the different line okay it's it should be like this okay and now we can",
  "it's it should be like this okay and now we can delete this one okay that's what I was wondering because you know the the actual data should have about 63 to4 lines of uh of data but over here we have about 66 so that was quite alarming for me but now when I'm looking at it so that's quite evident why we were receiving that kind of figure so here we have uh 1795 check it should 1795 find all so it's not able to find it okay okay here is it here it is okay and it faces the same problem so this",
  "it is okay and it faces the same problem so this bam has been transferred to the next line trun it okay this is C and now we are able to nothing is present in this line except that simply delete this one and now how many rows do we have so we have about 63 rows that's perfectly fine okay that is the exact amount of RS we should have so now this data is entirely uh usable so now what I will recommend you guys is simply uh you know just copy this entire thing and open a new sheet will copy it a",
  "entire thing and open a new sheet will copy it a new sheet paste as values okay so now this is good okay which which was the third one you you deleted I deleted only two rows okay okay yeah because we have three pages so we are going to have two breakouts right so I will delete this one and uh now can I even explain you why did I do it that [Music] why did I deleted that speet yeah please no the formatting was different so here it simp I think I'm planning to convert it to a CSV file and what",
  "I'm planning to convert it to a CSV file and what happens is that if you have kind some kind of formatting then CSV might post some uh difficulties for you and in Ro we don't want that kind of difficulties to De right so simply uh s uh just paste it as values I'm going to save it and I'm going to save over here it should be as CSV utf8 format save and it's done all right so now that's done where it is it is here it is what is the difference between UTF and normal CSV UTF uses uh a different",
  "UTF and normal CSV UTF uses uh a different kind of En coding for asky values so it uses an 8 bit uh I guess it's 8 by or bit J I guess it's bits it's bits right okay so it's eight bits so utf8 means that it's going to use eight bits to convert the text that you have given it so uh I won't be get getting into much details for that but when we are considering bits so let's say these are eight bits this eight yeah these are eight so no I'm just asking where is there any changes in the value itself",
  "where is there any changes in the value itself I asking while clicking just no not at all not at all not at all so that's just kind just just a encoding format you have to use okay okay I don't quite remember the full form of UTF but uh it actually encodes your each and every letter each and every letter of aski in 8bit format okay there is also UTF 16 which is much more advanced and it accounts for many more symbols which can't be you know adjusted in the range of 8bit characters okay uh so",
  "in the range of 8bit characters okay uh so just a second yeah uh so if it requires to use some other encoding then it will be mentioned in the question itself that you need to use this particular encoding because in ga1 we had question related to utf16 so if it requires some other encoding it will mentioned in that okay so now we simply have to import PD pandas as PD okay now I'll be opening up CSV okay so now what you have to keep in mind is that if you have been asked to open a particular",
  "that if you have been asked to open a particular file in a certain encoding here we can pass a parameter to pandas read CSP and it is as follows I guess it was encoding yeah it's encoding so over here you can mention the encoding as well okay so just like J just mentioned that you will be given the encoding in which you to open the file so in this case it is utfa okay and in some case it might be some other kind of according you just have to mention it over here okay let's just check the data",
  "it over here okay let's just check the data absolutely we have 24 columns and 63 rows that's perfect and let's go to our page okay so what it's asking us to do is step for okay so given the data set okay this is the formula for wqi or right we have to add all these and this is p is a parameter W okay okay okay this is parameter small okay and St for calculating parameters and weights for each parameter okay so uh Step One is compute parameters uh for each station code compute the following so",
  "uh for each station code compute the following so guys I'll be honest that I'm solving this for the first time uh and uh this this these questions were also hidden from me so uh yeah I'll be solving with you guys okay so for each station code compute the following seven parameters using the formula seven parameters okay parameters compute temperature pH conductivity B nitrite nitrate plus FAL chloroform total callif form sorry the formulas should be used is that okay okay for parameter okay",
  "be used is that okay okay for parameter okay okay let's just have a look at the data so this is a Min temperature max temperature mean temperature as well okay Min pH Max pH all right we have conductivity as well we have b as well okay so these four have been present over okay so we have nitrate plus nitrate content Max Min it's present over here we have FAL qualiform min max mean and min max total uh qualif form I'm not sure what's min total qual form and Max total qualiform okay that's okay",
  "form and Max total qualiform okay that's okay so okay so these are the parameters are provided so the formulas to use are for each parameter okay to calculate its normalized value and for the temperature e should be okay for all these we have to calculate this all right so for that it's pretty simple let's just look at it okay so it would be we have to create a so it's data and uh also guys if you think that uh I'm going wrong somewhere just guide me okay so this should be the name and let's",
  "me okay so this should be the name and let's see yeah it's absolutely working fine so this is the Min and then we have so we have to calculate this for each and every uh for each and every parameter okay you can just create the new one right huh you just create a new column using those values and absolutely we have to do that okay so J we have to calculate the temperature and these parameters for each and every parameters given over there right yeah for every parameter you need to calculate p",
  "yeah for every parameter you need to calculate p mean minus so whatever is Formula so we have also one example and you have to create one new column perfectly fine okay so by the way the wording us over there is the wording used over there is bit confusing so they are saying that for each parameter calculate the and then so they're using the word parameter a lot and that's you know kind of creating the confusion but that's what we have to do deal with okay we can't say anything about that so",
  "with okay we can't say anything about that so let's uh look at this uh okay so we have to find we have to apply this formula for each and every uh parameter and we will be creating new what I will do is I will create a new data frame inste that would be much more better and let's name it parameters so it's going to be an entire rain of parameters now okay so this would be PD dot data frame all right and so let's name it par because parameter is long to type and I'm buzy okay so uh it's going to",
  "to type and I'm buzy okay so uh it's going to be for tempor first I think Shan you can first have a look at questions and then make a decision if you want to create columns in the same data frame or you want to create a new data frame and if you want to create a new data frame how exactly you will be creating it well that's a pretty good point and if you're going to create par okay so if you're going to create a new data frame then it's not going to be but it's going to be actually we can use",
  "to be but it's going to be actually we can use different data frames to filter out stuff as well and let's just give it a try why not okay so okay so no no it is possible for you to directly do it because uh all the functioning you'll be doing for the first question will be based on the parameters you're going to calculate so you are suggesting me to uh put it in the same data frame or different no no different data frame would be easier to the eye the thing is that you can if it requires some",
  "eye the thing is that you can if it requires some kind of filtering as well so let's say this is data and we can simply use our paradata frame as well over here for filtering out so that's possible yeah by the way if J is recommending us to look at these questions then why not okay uh okay so the combine the data from newly created parameters example okay okay okay but after apply normalization so this is normalization It's normalization value okay this normalization after apply ization okay",
  "okay this normalization after apply ization okay okay follow these steps to determine the weits for okay combine the data from all newly created parameters columns after nor assume the combine data test okay sort the combine data okay select weights based on the first that's bit confusing I will leave that to uh my future self My Future Self on the next five minutes but I will be Computing these columns okay so the formula is going to be p mean minus P Min P Max minus pin okay into 100 that's",
  "minus P Min P Max minus pin okay into 100 that's PR simple and it's going to be TAA and the name so it's so it should be me yeah it's mean we are subtracting everything from mean all right data by the way these new line characters a bit annoying but you don't have the time to rectify them okay it's done and it should be like [Music] this should it should be mean and the max okay it's Max minus mean all right Max mean okay and then we have to multiply it by 100 all right let's check our par and",
  "it by 100 all right let's check our par and temp okay it's giving us nine values as well so max minus Min minimum okay okay okay it's Max minus my B all right so uh okay so this these are SE are the values that we have to work with but again it's giving us n values uh have we given some directions to solve n values I guess not okay we can you can actually you know just fill these values with a zero never mind okay so uh let's check okay so all these values are n okay some values are n what we",
  "these values are n okay some values are n what we can do is we can replace with zero first Yes actually in the original data set if you look at few cells there are some missing values so those missing values fill it with zero yeah so in the base data set this data set we have to replace these values this is another thing that you have to keep in mind okay it should be F now I'm not wrong and it should be I don't know what's that and I'll be filling it with a zero all right so it has uh yeah it",
  "it with a zero all right so it has uh yeah it has filled everything so saving it it's done and Max and mean values are same I'm not to understand like like we are subra me and by Max yeah that's the formula right that's the form we we have all Val same actually we getting Z by Z okay so it's going to give us uh divide by zero that's what you are saying right yeah H that's a pretty good point and if that happens try to run it once if it give us some fals then okay it hasn't okay why is it I I",
  "some fals then okay it hasn't okay why is it I I saved it it's save uh still okay okay so it's trying to calculate that and it's not able to that's why it's giving us n so what we can do is rather than making these changes over here we can uh do these changes in this PA data frame that's a pretty good point Arjun thanks for helping me okay so this is good and uh I will just duplicate this line multiple times because that's what we have to do and it's pH next next so it should be pH and Main pH",
  "it's pH next next so it should be pH and Main pH okay so I just have to change the wording right I yeah yeah have to just change the wordings so it should be mean pH pH and uh yeah mean pH b h Max pH okay that's good next is going to be conductivity and the name of these columns are conductiv that okay so this is the column isn't it uh okay so these are not the entire names of all these columns we have to use the column column attribute now we'll get everything okay okay so it's main",
  "now we'll get everything okay okay so it's main conductivity replace it with this okay and to here repl all right and then Max Max it's going to be here all right and it's going to be mean all right next again the same thing we just copy this instead it's going to be Min change multiple times then Max okay that's the entire same thing don't need to C let's hope it works and next is also I have to change these values I will name it Con then pod then it's nitrate right yeah it's nitrate I'll just",
  "it's nitrate right yeah it's nitrate I'll just name it nitrate and it's going to be nitrate copy everything then change it change it okay change it change it okay that's good veal qualif form good okay so it's okay so it's just speak qualiform and total qualiform all right so uh it's this yes by the way guys if you spot some mistakes of M just point it out duplicate this line and and okay it's going callif for let's hope it doesn't crash okay par all right okay that's pretty good and now I'll",
  "all right okay that's pretty good and now I'll be F and zero par let's just check first okay par it's ging giving us Infinity as well let's just leave it for now because I guess we try to divide it by zero right par and it's done okay so this is done and next is temperature and for that uh okay for formula for temperature is this okay okay okay this is an example all right right that's an example I didn't read that line okay so I thought the that we have to use two parameters somehow two",
  "that we have to use two parameters somehow two formulas okay the next is uh weights calculation for each parameter and this is going to be combine the data from all newly created parameter parameter columns example after normalization assume okay okay sort the combined data in descending order okay we have to sort each and everything in descending order now and all these columns should be sort in descending order okay let's just try that okay uh second e okay Sange yeah so you would require to",
  "second e okay Sange yeah so you would require to yeah you would require to get get the top uh I mean you would need to sort the combined data combine by combining means it's uh flatten this particular data frame so it have 63 cross 7 uh elements so you should should put all of them in a list and then you sort it and then after that you apply the later steps we have flatten it all right so I guess there is a flatten function no it's not it's a numai so we have to reshape it and the reshape it's",
  "so we have to reshape it and the reshape it's going to be the okay uh how is it going to be let me just use GPT okay so it's going to be uh data Frame data frame uh okay it should be one D it's values and R all right let's try it so rehap won't rehap is also going to work I'm not sure how Okay so this is our entire array okay this is the entire array and I'll be storing it in par okay so this is my par array all right so now let's see what we have to do so now we have okay so it is have to sort",
  "to do so now we have okay so it is have to sort the entire data okay sort it okay uh okay in descending order is it yeah it's in descending order reverse equals to True okay now okay it's giving us Infinity at the top that's something we have to trunk it uh okay so this is giving us this select weits based on the first seven multiples of four the values thing is the column where we you're saving the pars right what is the values column this is not this is not actually column so if I if I just",
  "not this is not actually column so if I if I just do this it's going to give us all all the values in the columns okay just the values not the data so it's as you can see this is a 2 by it's a 2d array at the moment okay so if I just when I just use this Ravel function it's going to unravel each okay so that's okay and then seven have to what we have to do the seven multiples of four positions select the weights based on the first seven multiples of four from the sorted data for seven multiples",
  "of four from the sorted data for seven multiples of four okay seven multiples of four uh are positions all right extract weights okay from these positions all right so why the time trying to find the multiples if it's given over here okay this is done I'll store it into sort air this is good and what I'm going to do is uh in the soer so this soter I will be removing this one okay why not do it right this is good okay now we have what we do is the first seven multiples of four are positions this",
  "first seven multiples of four are positions this this and this okay so these four positions I guess I can find it like this let me check I haven't Che it that if this works or not it's obviously not going to work okay uh create a one liner array it's going to be like this if you guys don't know how to create a one liner one L for Loop then this is the moment you can learn it okay it's I for I in sort a and then even do the multiple logic here uhhuh you can even do the multiple logic here",
  "uhhuh you can even do the multiple logic here multiple logic at seven multiples yeah I can do that but why to waste by time actually it's not seven multiples it's actually four multiples four seven multiples okay we have to find the first seven multiples of four and the entire these multiple these positions have been given to us so why do start so sort uh this it's going to work definitely yeah so these are our weights all right so extract the weights from this positions done okay next",
  "the weights from this positions done okay next available values if uh okay so assign weights by applying lexor graphical sorting on the parameters names all right so given parameters are this so lexor graphically sorted are these uh okay got it so these are uh J what do you think that uh we have to apply the weights on the normal data or the extracted that we have uh extracted that we have given normalized data okay so it's going to be normalized right okay so we have the normalized data right",
  "right okay so we have the normalized data right over here uh it's working right it's there yeah it's perfectly fine good now we're going to do is uh we have to calculate these uh and the lexor graphically sorted are like these so the entire thing has been given to you in the question so why do waste your time leog graphically sorting these values right so uh that's pretty good of the question makers to give us these values right I just use is M will Multi cursor work yeah multi cursor working",
  "will Multi cursor work yeah multi cursor working so you named the night trate plus nitrate as only nitrate so yeah yeah thank you I have to check my names as well so it's bod okay bod is right there and then conduct it's was conduct it was just cor okay then next is FAL next is going to be pH and then it's going to be 10 is it temp right it's temp not temperature okay so apply this and this is our array not an array actually this is uh okay so this is going to work and now this is our what we",
  "this is going to work and now this is our what we have to do is par and let's just check this as well to work total okay it was okay it was uh what it was check it it was FAL okay all right so this is tically sorted but the next thing is that we have to apply these weights to our lexor graphically sorted values okay so let's I will just make the data like this so it's lexically sorted par all right so I will be appllying so this is the I'll store it as weight okay so now I'll be running for",
  "it as weight okay so now I'll be running for Loop for I in par columns and now absolutely thank you C so uh okay so is it right uh we don't need this actually what we can do is we can use enate cod codm is actually this something which makes you want to use vs code exactly get up copilot is also good but I love codium okay it has saved my skin multiple times all right so uh this is guess it's going to work let's also okay it's not going to work so list Industries must be in integers or slices",
  "so list Industries must be in integers or slices not s why is it must be a string values here h MH okay okay my bad my bad now it's going to work so guys if you're not able to understand this enamorate so what does enate do I will just demonstrate it to you pretty quickly so in uh inate parac columns and now print I NJ okay so this par columns it's going to give you a list of these columns okay that's pretty easy okay that's pretty understood now what does this enough it does it's I will just",
  "what does this enough it does it's I will just try to apply over here and just check if it's going to work or not it's yeah it has created an enumerate instance so what it's going to do is when I run this can you see this this I is the index of the element and this J is the value okay instead of this you could have simply you know created a for Loop like this for I in range uh Len parac columns absolutely and print uh parac column I so this is also one thing that you could have done but inab it",
  "one thing that you could have done but inab it actually allows you to get both the index and the value at once okay so this is how you have to you can just quickly do it instead of creating a separate for Loop like this okay so our data is pretty ready let's just check perfect so our data is ready and and now the task is to calculate the wqi using the given formula and normalize wqi okay okay okay first let's check the W what the formula it is uh okay we have to multiply the parameters uh",
  "is uh okay we have to multiply the parameters uh that's done and we have to add them as well okay so we have to add the columns is it what do you think so we have to add the columns right okay okay okay we have to add the colums so uh for adding The Columns I'm not quite sure let's just ask chat GPT because we not how to add the columns in my uh rather row M okay okay so this is one thing that jaaj actually pointed out that we have to calculate the rows for that okay I thought that we have to",
  "the rows for that okay I thought that we have to combine all the columns because then we will have 63 uh rows for 63 records which have the added values but if we correctly look if we look at the formula so it's uh it's the parameter and then the weight and then we have to add okay okay okay so we have to add the row all right and uh let's ask Chad JP how to do that uh I just change the question to add the rows in my data frame to add all rows and send add the rows you can use some okay it's no",
  "send add the rows you can use some okay it's no no no actually I have to okay okay okay that's uh so I just forgot about the sum and you just have to use the axis uh by the way guys if you hear J laughing so yeah that was pretty something that I to my stupidity on that part okay so okay it actually gave us the right answer yeah here it is so it's giving us Infinity for nitrate uh okay and uh what do you think what should we do should we truncate this infinity and put a zero basically what you",
  "this infinity and put a zero basically what you need to do you need to calculate uh those uh wqi for each station ID so this is you're summing up all the uh columns instead you sum it rowwise actually lost where the wqi calculation started yes sir same here every top but how how did we get the for guys uh yeah so what's your questions after we got the that sorting and then weights right did that seven multiples of four thing and then how did we get to the part where we calculated wqi from that",
  "get to the part where we calculated wqi from that so the thing is that you have got the weights you have M so the part where wqi comes to the places that is when we are actually multiplying the weights with the columns okay so this p is our parameter The Columns and and W is our weight okay and multiplying them and then we are going to sum them so uh okay so what uh J has uh suggested is that actually we have to put we have to because if we read the question properly that for each station code",
  "the question properly that for each station code we have to compute something okay so this is for each station code so I guess we should do like this using access one we have to get 63 values like this h H so this is the thing that we have to do instead of uh summing with the columns because that doesn't make any sense okay so now the thing is that after calculating the wqi formula normalize wqi on a 0 to 100 scale okay so for normalizing it to a 0 to 100 scale what we can do is we can use a",
  "a 0 to 100 scale what we can do is we can use a min max scaler uh what do you think is a min max scaler a good option or should we use a Max absolute scaler because yeah what's your thoughts about that I use max okay min max scalar we have to do use right okay so uh for I guess have to check the formula for min max once normalization all right so it should be okay so it's going to give you from 0 to one I'm going to you start okay how to uh normalize my data on a 0 to 100 scale let's check okay",
  "my data on a 0 to 100 scale let's check okay okay okay okay yeah it's giv me some values okay so this is the formula and I'm going to copy it it should be like this uh okay so this is what we've got and I'll be saving it into a different value so it should be wqy but these are parameters now didn't we already scale them these are our parameters but these uh so actually our parameters are right over here in this par uh so these are our parameters these are our weights and when we multiply them",
  "these are our weights and when we multiply them then we are getting the okay and then we have to scale again then we have to sum them once and then that's a w okay so uh when we look at the wqi so this these are the Ws okay now we have to normalize them into 0 to 100 scale okay so it should be wqi and what I will do is just simply change all references Qi right and let's just print it okay uh all right uh let's check it once uh wqi okay save it over here and uh let's just check it value counts",
  "over here and uh let's just check it value counts it's giving us zeros okay uh have I miss uh normalize wqi on 0 to 100 scale that's what we are trying to do uh let's just check it once ah so that is because the maximum one is uh infinite yeah that's infinite so what do you think J should we replace it with a zero okay let's replace it with a zero uh let me just check all the so it's wqi okay and uh can I replace it I guess it was a replace function what do you guys think yeah it's a replace",
  "what do you guys think yeah it's a replace function I guess okay so two replace and all right it should be an in Infinity INF and uh guess this is going to work it's not going to work we St may do the NP something yeah that's what I think how to replace okay it's giving us something okay we have to use an NP in so import Lum as NP np. INF and yeah in place true so what does this in place true do it will replace those values in your data frame itself so you need not you know just if after",
  "itself so you need not you know just if after replacing then you need not store it into the data frame okay so it's going to replace those values in the data frame and that's irreversible now okay so these values have been done and uh now we have to normalize them let's again copy our formula yeah it's present over here I'll just put it right here now okay now run it okay Che right yeah we have the noral all right so now let's look at identify unsafe stations where wqi is greater than five okay",
  "stations where wqi is greater than five okay it's less than five all right so it should be something like this but we need those codes station codes or something yeah we have to use the station codes as well so it's less than 50 and and it is like this it's less than 50 okay so now now we are going to use the part where yeah actually going to use different so this red is actually I'm going to name it something else so this is Norm wqi so actually red is a variable which I use very often it",
  "red is a variable which I use very often it doesn't mean anything but I just like it okay so uh okay it's giving me okay none okay okay this data let me check if it is working working perfectly now what we to do is we have to get the index IND es uh is it to get the indexes uh let's get the indexes okay now data and uh uh I guess I have to use an i and uh okay and also I have just have to get the station ID right so it's the station code and I have to get this okay so location based indexing",
  "have to get this okay so location based indexing can only have integers all right uh should have work you can you you can use zero now uhhuh so instead of station code you can use zero oh yeah absolutely my bad absolutely yeah so now we are getting the data so thank you Ric so actually iog doesn't uh allow spring values okay so I actually just pasted the name of this the the field which is not allowed in ilock that's allowed in lock not an iog okay so remember that so uh now we have got the",
  "okay so remember that so uh now we have got the station codes now what we'll do so map s codes to pin codes using this TB file because this is a TB file to download let's just check what we have in this DV file okay we extracted uhv also no nothing I I just asking you something which you will also know when you open it yeah okay so this is our DV file so if you guys are wondering that why am I able to see this like this so this is because I have an extension for viewing DB files okay so you can",
  "an extension for viewing DB files okay so you can download that instruction in vs code and you'll also be able to see this okay so we have uh what do we have so we have station codes and PIN codes okay so firstly we have to import this in our data and uh the way for that I don't know so I will be going to my arsenal of codes okay so uh okay so this is actually the entire Arsenal I created on in my own Ro and it's helping me S so uh uh I guess this is going to work so you have to use alemy as",
  "this is going to work so you have to use alemy as well uh okay open source implementation of Your Arsenal uh what is is some part of this Arsenal open source somewhere open source means if it is available on a if it's publically available GitHub uh no actually it is not okay so sir I'm getting an error when I'm trying to run the previous line you're trying yeah yeah this one dat what's the error uh it says iog requires numeric indexes index so uh that's the same which I got so the thing is that",
  "that's the same which I got so the thing is that iog uh won't allow you to pass uh pass string values so you have to provided numerical value so these indexes are numerical values okay if I just printed so these are numerical values right zero is the index of the column okay so just check it once if you are uh following the entire this entire syntax or not and check it okay that's all I can say right okay so this is done and it's engine okay so I have to change it uh it's not an Roi it's",
  "so I have to change it uh it's not an Roi it's present here and the name of the TV is pin Cod station. TV check all right it's working good uh now we have to use this and all right is it going to work it's work okay okay okay it's searching for this fpm value and uh the name of this is what's the name of it's pin Cod station _ code pin code underscore uh station station all right so let's just check a data ah there we have it so we have the station codes and the pin all right so oh my bad",
  "station codes and the pin all right so oh my bad actually I saved it in as a data it's not advisable so what I will do is I will save it in a pin and this is the pin and now uh okay it's working so now what I'm going to do is simply extracted okay moreover I will be saving this in the uh what to do so map the station okay so these are the defective station so I will be uh naming this as defect station so this is going to be a series now a panda series okay there may be an issue here because we",
  "series okay there may be an issue here because we uh replace data with pin code thing so we may have to run that initial data thing again yeah we have to run that initial data once again and that's my bad and yeah so uh you know when you are doing your Ro just remember this that provide unique names so what I did was I just simply copied it from here and uh I just ran it so that's not what you have to do just provide unique names to your whenever you're importing your data set and because just",
  "you're importing your data set and because just like in my case I had this data variable with the original data over here right so now I just re placed it with this data and then I have to actually rerun this with another variable name so that's not advisable and that's going to con okay so this pin is done and what we have to do is this is the defective stations and uh okay so what we have to do we have the defective stations right over here uh is it defective station yeah we have the",
  "here uh is it defective station yeah we have the defective stations what we have to do is we'll be run up we'll run up pandas filter on situation code okay it's suggesting us that's pretty good okay so this is uh giving us some data and we can see that all these station codes have been given a pin Cod okay so it's working perfectly what I'm going to do is simply get the PIN code now PIN codes so that's the PIN code I'll delete this one so these are the uh six digigit pin codes what you to do",
  "are the uh six digigit pin codes what you to do next so output the sir a comma separated list of PIN codes where water is safe to drink uh uh again I guess I have to convert it to a to list yeah to list absolutely so this is the list of our PIN codes simply copy it and paste in the so this is going to be the answer okay where water answer so what part of this entire thing which I have done till now what does what is your doubt this entire uh sir I guess I missed the part where the norm wqi the",
  "I guess I missed the part where the norm wqi the labels were converted to numerical values labs are converted to numerical values so I did nothing like that so the thing is that uh uh let me just go once again was uh okay the thing is in this Norm wqi uh you're asking about this right yes sir so I didn't convert any label to a numerical value so this is a norm wqi uh this is what this is where we normalize the wqi right so this wqi when we are going to perform when we're going to apply filter",
  "going to perform when we're going to apply filter on this of greater than 50 sorry of less than 50 nor wqi and this right so this is going to give us some data okay this is going to return us some values and these values will have some indexes as well okay so what are these indexes so these indexes are nothing but the uh the the locations the row numbers where the where the normalized wqi is less than okay so we have got this so so how to extract these indexes simply use an index attribute okay",
  "these indexes simply use an index attribute okay so we will get these indexes as a uh kind of list and after that simply pass it to an iog function so what is this iog function this is going to take two values in it and these two values are going to be the number the uh the indexes of the rows so these are the rows we require and then the column okay and the columns are nothing but the uh so if I just print this uh data okay it's not going to work again because I have replaced data so I have to",
  "again because I have replaced data so I have to scroll up okay so the zeroth column is over here okay this is the zeroth column that's why we have provided that zero over there okay so is this understood or should I yes sir sir this IP file can you provide after the session is over uh can you please repeat yes sir can you provide this file after the session so so that I can cross uh actually I have to check uh yeah I guess we are going to provide you this file yeah yeah we are going to provide",
  "you this file yeah yeah we are going to provide you the entire file and I'm not we are not going to provide you this entire mess we are going to give you a completely structured file which have each and every Solutions okay thank you more moreover we will be providing you that solutions for that first Ro mock as well very soon okay right okay so so this is uh what this is our pin code simply copy this list and provide your answer all right so that was bit uh exhausting okay so now let's look at",
  "was bit uh exhausting okay so now let's look at the second question and I guess that we have completed all the heavy lifting part and now we just have to you know pluck the fruits of our efforts which is get the station with the least wqi and figure out what would be what would be change okay so that's pretty bad I guess so what would be change in wqi if bod parameter is increased by uh 20 person keeping everything other I guess we have to reun the entire thing okay uh guys just give me a few",
  "the entire thing okay uh guys just give me a few seconds I'll just have some phot okay so let's get started with the second question get the St with the least wqi and figure out okay the least wqi okay so we have to find the St with the least wqi and that's going to be the one the thing is that we have multiple stations with zero WQ okay so uh what we can do is just uh to get I will just create a macdown over there Q2 okay now let's put a filter which is Norm wqi I have to get the minimum one",
  "which is Norm wqi I have to get the minimum one get the minimum yeah for something this Norm wqy do men all right so we have multiple options over here so what we can do is we can uh let's check the station numbers as well so again okay so the thing is that I have to rerun this data now uh okay rerun the data and uh what all had yeah data is has been okay so have to this okay and Par difference okay that's that's pretty good uh we are lucky that we created separate param separate variables for",
  "we created separate param separate variables for this par because uh we created a separate data frame for this par because if we had actually uh put these values and put these columns in this data itself then it would have probably created much more work for us okay so let's see uh okay we have to use this thanks a lot and uh okay it's giving us the same error we have to use ilock and uh Insight comma yeah there we have it uh what we can do over here is that we can uh get the station number",
  "here is that we can uh get the station number with the least station ID okay so for that uh let's do one thing I'll sort this uh sort values okay sorted and 16 is the least value okay so get the station the and figure out what would be changed if the wqi of B parameter is increased by 20% keeping each and everything not changed okay so for the 16th station we have to increase The Bod by 20% okay and what I'm going to do is uh I guess uh we have to change it over here as well okay we have to",
  "to change it over here as well okay we have to change it in this para yeah I'll be changing it in the par data frame and Par in this par frame we have to get the station so the station okay so this minimum station the 16th station ID have the index 58 okay so let's just check it I lock and it's going to be 58 and uh I will check it uh let's just check it okay so the Pod uh okay we can't increase it this way we can't increase is this way uh I guess that these are the places that we actually",
  "guess that these are the places that we actually reduced it uh what should we do J what do you suggest should we uh you know ignore these zero values and check the for because if we just head to that zero if it's zero or if it's Infinity any there is no change and there is no change now whatever value is there that will be the answer yeah okay so we have so what do suggesting so should we give the answer zero okay so the answer is going to be zero all right so uh that saves us a lot of time",
  "zero all right so uh that saves us a lot of time calculating this okay because that's going to be zero okay so no change yeah there is no change so but when it comes to percentage change then it's going to be zero right uh next is uh Q3 continuing question number one we have pin code coordinates backet file that Maps PIN codes to relative latitudes and longitudes for each station code okay first just download this and let's have a look at its conts uh again save a text drop drag it to our",
  "conts uh again save a text drop drag it to our workplace uh where was it yeah so this is the parket file uh and it's showing us as Json all right let's try to import it and I'll uh name it create a markdown of Q3 all right so this is going to be how we did it so I have to check my code Arsenal and where is parket Park yeah here here is Park so this is the parket one and we have to use Pi Arrow as well I hope I have P AR so it's going to be PD uncore sorry it's going to pd. read pocket and I",
  "uncore sorry it's going to pd. read pocket and I will name it par yes have a c instead of K okay won't work without p uh sorry please repeat would it not work with without P Arrow Engine let's check it once CU why not okay let's check it and remove this okay it's working without P Arrow okay all right it's working without P Arrow perhaps I have made some changes in my libraries perhaps I have downloaded something which doesn't require me to use P okay so okay this is our parket file and what we",
  "okay so okay this is our parket file and what we have to do just we have a parket file file that Maps PIN codes to respective latitudes and longitudes okay and for each station code find its corresponding pin code from okay then ret the lud and ludes for each pin code from find it pin code okay that's done then retrieve the ludes and longitudes for each pin Bood from okay Det closest pair of cities based on their coordinates okay this is what we have to do so we need not use any other data set",
  "have to do so we need not use any other data set in this any other data frame in this just this park data frame is enough for us to do it okay so for that let me ask start GPT that given given uh uh given multiple let ask it this way given two sets of lats and Longs how to compute the distance I guess it's going to give us something Rel to the great circle formula it's giving us have sign formula whatever it is uh you CLE in approximation I guess it's not going to work so what I'm going to do",
  "it's not going to work so what I'm going to do is going to ask it for specifically for uh great circle I just confirming one thing there was no way to check the answers now for mock 3 yeah there is no way actually these mocks are just for you to experience what's an Roe okay it's not to variate your answers so this is the experience thing is actually something which is making us otherwise it would have been a big shock exactly I will I will tell you that this is the first time that we are",
  "tell you that this is the first time that we are having these mock Aris before that we never had these moars in my term we never had these moars so when we sat in our first Ro it was like getting hit by a bus okay it was some everything was new to us we didn't know how to manage our time we didn't know how to get everything right we were just uh were just you know directed or suggested to or advised is the better word to create an arsenal of these codes and that's what I did so if I not wrong",
  "codes and that's what I did so if I not wrong that uh then Carlton who was a TA by then he actually recommended every student to create an Arsenal like that and that's what I did and that's how I was able to score well okay so let's see what it has given us uh okay it's going to use the H sign whatever the name is sign okay so let's just copy this it has thankfully it has given us a function to use uh all right and what to do is uh just simply pass these values so it's going to be okay it's",
  "pass these values so it's going to be okay it's going to be something like this okay so this is going to be the distance and uh looking at the file we have to create so if we look at it we have to create a 63 by 63 Matrix of these latitudes and longitudes and then compute which one is the smallest isn't it JJ what do you suggest uh actually it is from the continuation of question one so just use the uh station code that you got in question one that will reduce some computations uh let me have a",
  "will reduce some computations uh let me have a look at the question once again continuing this is this is uh okay this is what we have done already for each station code find its corresponding that's also done then retrieve the rudes and longitudes for each pin code from uh okay and determine the closest pair of C so that's pretty much done J so what we can simply do is we can uh calculate the latitudes and longitudes we have actually we have to create this 63 by 63 Matrix and uh then we will",
  "create this 63 by 63 Matrix and uh then we will be able to find the minimum distance uh that will be complex in terms of time maybe just take the upper first rows for time I mean it will take a lot of time for 63 okay so J is suggesting that rather than Computing the entire Matrix and Matrix which is going to take uh approx o n complexity of time so instead of doing that we should just take the first five rows for demonstration purposes so because I'm demonstrating this to you guys that's why",
  "I'm demonstrating this to you guys that's why we are going to take the first five rowes if when you are in the RO you have to do it with the entire data set okay so remember that so it's going to be like this head is going to give us the first five rules and I'm going to save it in let's say park I'm going to save it in park okay because I can simply uh read this parket file once again there is no harm in doing that okay so we have the we have the latitudes and longitudes uh what we have to do",
  "latitudes and longitudes uh what we have to do is [Music] uh okay so we have to uh let's print it okay so this is the that one we have to run for Loop for I in range L Pa thank you and for J in yeah uh and now let one is this let okay it's helping us let do is this yeah yeah thank you thank you so codam is helping us a lot and then we have to okay what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a different uh list is going to be distance list and uh I'm going to upend so I'm going to name it",
  "and uh I'm going to upend so I'm going to name it distances because this variable is already being used over here so I will be distances up hand and that's good okay what's the issue so it's actually okay okay okay so that's the issue okay that's the issue so it's looking for that wait and uh just duplicate this it's going to be l two l two okay my that again it's going to be J and J okay it's saying the distance is not all right that's okay what is it saying five is it not in range I'm going",
  "is it saying five is it not in range I'm going to use iock okay and iock it's going to work pretty fine let me just print the data so the the values are like this so it's going to be the first okay so the index for the column is one for latitude is one and the index for longitude is two okay so I and it's going to be one and that's longitude so latitude these are four values and I will going to like this it's going to be long long and like this and uh it's going to be J and J and two uh and",
  "and uh it's going to be J and J and two uh and also we have to change it over here okay it's it's non actually okay this should work calling some problems let me put it okay okay okay okay okay this is codium fault now it's going to work okay so thises all right so this the distances that we have got and now what we have to do is okay so it's returning us like this let's check the length Okay so it's going to be a 63x 63 Matrix h I do something wrong 25 head of okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah",
  "wrong 25 head of okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah we use head right so okay so what we can do is uh let's get the highest max value so max okay uh what we can do is simply convert it to a series Once because once you have con converted a list to a series then it's going to give you multiple options okay so this is our entire series I'm going to get the idx max kist at my God okay uh okay I have to import P what's again we could do Max what is the difference between Max and idx Max yeah I'm",
  "the difference between Max and idx Max yeah I'm going to show you guys what's the difference asking for NP as well all right uh is this uh okay let me check what's the okay it's giving us something very different okay okay so we haven't applied the head or we have actually we have applied the head let me check it once again it's reading head let's check okay good good good good yeah these are 25 values and now so this is a series okay and I'll change the name distance yeah distances because",
  "change the name distance yeah distances because that doesn't matter if it it was just a list and I just converted to a series okay so now that distance uh so okay now the difference between a Max and ID Max so the difference is that Max is going to Max method is going to return you the maximum value and idx Max is going to return you the index of the maximum value okay so the index of the maximum value is 90 is that understood by everyone what's the difference between idx Max and Max yes",
  "what's the difference between idx Max and Max yes perfect okay so uh so the the difference between so the uh highest value highest index is 19 and now we know that n we have 19 so when we are considering the location the location with with a 19 then what you can can somebody can someone tell me how can I extract out the cities with this particular value because it's pretty simple just tell me what is your uh what What's your uh way of solving in this how you going to approach this problem we",
  "in this how you going to approach this problem we have 19 over here and how can I get the two cities out of them because that parket thing that database yeah we got it from a parket but the thing is that this is just a f r Matrix sorry uh yeah F uh data frame how are you going to get the city with yes the PIN code uhhuh we need the PIN codes well can you please repeat uh we need to identify the PIN code yeah we have to identify the PIN codes uh but which two pin codes actually have this value",
  "but which two pin codes actually have this value can I tell this because let me give you a hint this is nothing related to pandas or something something like a code okay it's nothing that complex it's simple mathematics that's your head so how are you going to approach this anyone then answer uh sir here we take combinations of two uh two like two pin code so we can find out the 19 combination uh okay but that's not not going to solve the problem because how are you going to take those two uh",
  "because how are you going to take those two uh those nine those combinations of two you are pretty close I would say so one another hint can be so I'm going to draw on this screen so it's going to create a matrix right isn't it it's going to create a matrix for us when we are going to when we are calculating the values right so this Matrix has so uh is there any other way to I need a pen way to okay it's present okay this is a matrix okay and it's going to have five columns and five rows can",
  "it's going to have five columns and five rows can someone tell me why it's going to have five RS because it is from one pin code to every other pin code exactly it's from one pin code to every other pin code okay so it's here it's going to be pin one pin two and over here exactly the same thing P1 P2 right yes now if I ask you that I want this one I want the second value okay so let's say instead of 9 19 the maximum value was this one how would you approach it how would you try to find the",
  "you approach it how would you try to find the value uh the two cities so we can go rowwise like one two three and four and the row and the column are the values of PIN codes like the number of okay now let's let's say if I'm going to tell you that uh the value is this it's so let's say the maximum value is nine now how how are you going to tell me which two cities this value this particular value belongs to you a so guys you have been given this matrix it's pretty simple just tell me which two",
  "matrix it's pretty simple just tell me which two cities does this nine value belongs to P2 and P4 exactly it's P2 and P4 okay now in the same way just imagine this entire Matrix is filled okay this should be three actually four five and then there is 10 then there will be 15 over here then it's going to be 20 and then it's going to be 90 okay are you guys able to visualize what where I'm getting yes it's between third and yeah that's pretty evident that it's between uh P4 and B4 [Music] or okay",
  "that it's between uh P4 and B4 [Music] or okay actually the thing is that uh these indexes start from zero so this should be zero and then this should be one this should be three this should be two this should be three okay so actually 19 uh let's check if it we have a it will come in the left one P3 it's going to come at the left yes will be P5 P3 it's going to be P5 and P4 no no 0 1 2 3 4 that is8 5 6 7 8 9 yeah 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 okay it's going to be between P4 and P5 now given",
  "okay it's going to be between P4 and P5 now given this 19 so I just created this entire Matrix for you but on the screen over here let me just erase it so why am I spending so much time on this part because uh when when you are present in the Roa you are going to now the approaches that you have given to me of solving this are if you are going to apply those approaches then I would see that you will be wasting a lot of time why because you will be first of all you will try to visualize the",
  "be first of all you will try to visualize the Matrix or you will create the entire Matrix uh use reshape numpy and then what not and then just print the entire Matrix and see where the value lies so the much more easier way to do that is this 19 it's going to be spread like this okay and again going to draw something in Greens so n we know that it's going to be a front it's going to be a 5x5 Matrix okay and uh okay it's four 5 five Matrix and four will end over here okay so we are going to have",
  "will end over here okay so we are going to have five we are going to have five lists of we going to have five uh rows uh yeah they going to have five rows of five cells each right so now if I try to divide it by five perfect divide by five are you guys able to see this it's going to give me three okay and now I have this three and I guess I also have to find the mod let's check yeah and add two values in there here we have it okay here we have it so it's going to be row four column fth okay and",
  "so it's going to be row four column fth okay and why did I add this plus one can anyone tell me this can anyone tell me why I had to add this plus one because we have zero based indexing exactly because we have zero based indexing that's why we had to add Plus one for our personal understanding okay otherwise if we just remove these plus ones then we have the exact uh coordinates of that particular value on the in the data frame in The Matrix okay so why did I do this 9 19 perfect divide by",
  "okay so why did I do this 9 19 perfect divide by five because if you try to divide 9 by 5 it's going to give you something like this okay 3 .8 something something so that means that 3.8 something something means that the row it's going to end over here okay uh uh I'm not able to something like uh uh yeah so when we are perfectly dividing it by five so it's going to give us so let's say this is first one okay and then this is also done and then this is going to okay I guess I'm not doing a very",
  "is going to okay I guess I'm not doing a very good job at explaining this but uh I want you to feel what I'm trying to get at okay so perfectly dividing this by 19 by by five it's going to give us the exact value where our row is going to be okay so if it would have been let's say 10 and perfect divide by two then uh where would 10 have come 10 would have come right over here okay so this perfect divide is going to give us the row okay 10 is going to be here fine let's check for uh uh let's say",
  "to be here fine let's check for uh uh let's say 24 because we have 20 actually are because of zero indexing that's why we are going to have the last row it's going to be 24 okay enter this it's going to be four okay so 24 is right here and it's giving us four because it's present in the in this so it's is present in this group according to zero indexing and then mod by five because uh uh then actually uh then we are going to get we are going to understand that in which column it's present okay",
  "understand that in which column it's present okay so if you try to apply this logic okay just try to apply apply this logic yourself and then you will be able to understand because it's getting pretty hard for me to explain you guys this concept of uh why am I using this perfect divide and percentage because uh because the reasoning which I have in mind I'm not able to you know perfectly fit in on my inputs okay just try once and try to visualize an entire Matrix and try to look that if I'm",
  "an entire Matrix and try to look that if I'm trying to find this location then perfectly dividing it by the number of rows is is going to give me something or not okay and then moding it by the number of columns then it's going to give me the columns okay this is one technique can I urge you all to just go ahead and uh just try okay then you will be able to understand so this is going to give us the answer that it's going to be between these two cities now uh any questions regarding this or",
  "two cities now uh any questions regarding this or should we proceed with the next question any question guys are you trying to say something no no okay anyone with any questions or should we move ahead just one thing not a question a remark like how to do it within 40 minutes this entire question huh well I guess uh you would be able to do it within 20 within 45 minutes uh because uh currently I'm explaining you guys stuff that's why it's going to it's taking us about one and a half hour that's",
  "it's taking us about one and a half hour that's why it's going it's consuming so much time but when you are doing this I would recommend you guys to just read the entire question once and try to draw an entire flow chart in your mind this is this question is required to do this this this this this I need this this this this and quickly do it okay so uh just read a question once try to get a feel of it I would recommend you guys to keep a piece of paper around you and uh if you are a fast writer",
  "paper around you and uh if you are a fast writer let's say or in most cases just keep an entire mind map of what you're are going to apply what what's going to be your steps okay so that's going to be that is what you have to keep in mind okay so uh that's it for question number three where is the question yeah that's it for the question number three and then now it's question number four and then this pattern and now jaaj will be taking over jaaj uh go ahead uh so doesn't even know how would",
  "uh go ahead uh so doesn't even know how would you solve this question okay so for any so it requires you to create a fast API get end point and then which will take station code as an URL encoded for parameter and then in the response it will get these things okay so uh from where you can get uh state name for any station code oh am I audible you're audible yeah so from where I can get uh station uh state name if I I am given station code station code we can get that uh code so State we can get",
  "code we can get that uh code so State we can get it directly from here yes yes yeah and then what about District or something uh so what about District name so it is in in the location itself for example if I just open the data set [Music] okay basically what we can do is we can uh send in a function calling we can use function calling which is from ga3 so something like this and then we'll ask it to get uh the state name and then District name and also what is the other thing uh pin code so",
  "and also what is the other thing uh pin code so pin code we can get it by directly mapping a station code with that database DB file and then District we would have to use function calling to extract district from location and after fetching The District in case if for some location if it cannot identify what what is the possible District then just return null in that particular field for example if uh for this location gu some if it cannot figure out the district name then in District just put",
  "out the district name then in District just put null in that location so basically state name we can get directly from this uh PDF itself then pin code we will get it from that uh database file and then using this uh locations column we can send a request to open a function calling uh some request like this we'll have to create some functions and and then I send a request to chat completions with these headers and then this is how we can send the request and in response we'll get the uh these",
  "request and in response we'll get the uh these that District parameter District name right so actually I don't have access to the data so that's why I will just create a uh template code you can say so this is what we already have all right first we need to create a fast API which is from G2 you can we have anyway this is not not that much difficult so in the URL encoder parameter we'll receive station code which we need to pass over here so Define root and then within this we need to put a",
  "Define root and then within this we need to put a station underscore code and then uh maybe integer or string whatever is the type of the parameter all right since I don't have data for this and the idea is clear I we can move to the next question does anyone uh managed to solve question one of uh patent uh data set which have some XML files no but like I think beautiful soup feel use this yeah so let me open one of the XML file okay so how many of you are familiar with uh HTML files I think",
  "of you are familiar with uh HTML files I think everyone is familiar with extraction of data from HTML files no sir okay so actually what what what is use of this X HML file uh let me first explain what is HTML file in HTML file uh we have something called Dom structure so Dom structure is like uh we have some HTML or maybe I can use just then back HTML basically in between we have different things like div we can have and then we can have some other div over here and within this we can have so",
  "div over here and within this we can have so let us say if I want to store um for example this particular graded assignment it have these classes right card my and then five and then it have data question which is an attribute okay so this have q and then markdown so which is an attribute to identify this particular div element so basically uh in Dom we it is basically a structured way of representing any web page like first we have div or something with particular parameter and then within",
  "with particular parameter and then within this D we can have multiple tags such as H1 or some other purpose and then we can have some D tag and all of the all these tags are in a tree like structure so each individual div elements they can be uniquely identified by their position either it can be using their attributes or by using uh the location like if it doesn't have any attribute if it is plain div tag then it can be identified by zero and then first then second by indexing you can all",
  "then first then second by indexing you can all right so now from this this document if you want to identify the markdown question can anyone tell me how would we create a query for selecting this div yeah document do query selector and then we would need to I think uh this is an attribute we have something called ID and then we have something called class so IDs and classes these are two attributes and then apart from those two attributes we can create some custom attributes as well so I will",
  "create some custom attributes as well so I will just go to the documentation attribute should be equal to this thing so we need it with data hyphen question is equal to markdown and this will select this question so basically this HTML it have this Dom structure which identifies each of these individual tags with the corresponding attributes okay so similar to HTML Pages we have XML files which is used for storing data so for example over here we have this parent tag and after that we have in",
  "we have this parent tag and after that we have in which some data is there like file and then these are different attributes which are present over here so if you want to store items in a XML file then this is how we can create items array and then for each individual item we would have something like this and let's call it notebook and then we have type is equal to a stationary so basically we are creating a one XML file which have items which is an array of some objects and then each",
  "which is an array of some objects and then each individual item can be identified by this if we want to just select all the stationary item then how would you select that all right uh similar to htmls we can actually so in HTML we had tag right div over here we have item and then from item we need type to be stationary and this would uh get us all those items which have type as stationary and we can create some other it over here for example grocery then it it won't select these uh this",
  "grocery then it it won't select these uh this particular item so this uh XML is much more flexible it allows to create custom tags this is just to a store data okay now for this question we what we have to do is we need to get the highest number of claims and then for any particular patent ID so we can get a patent ID from here file name so uh here uh here is a mistake like for the given below data patent ID is this one actually it's we should have kept this line over there okay so this file",
  "have kept this line over there okay so this file name is for identifying the patent and after that we have an claims array uh which have individual claim so basically we need to compute the claim for each one of these so now I will go here let us say file name is equal to test.xml and then uh we need beautiful soup soup documentation so we'll need to install it first and experiment and after installing we'll also need to install XML parser I think we can use this one and then we can use one of",
  "we can use this one and then we can use one of these either this one or this other one but before that we need to import it now from here we need to get the tag with claims so we can create a query selector let's call this as soup and this is the file name let me move it a bit up I'm just all right and then we need to get to the file name so we can use this particular tag uh select one is the function that that will get that is similar to query selector and then select is the function that is",
  "selector and then select is the function that is similar to qu selector all in JavaScript all right and but this one get us the file name actually we'll need to get all the attributes from it so this is the way we can get all the attributes tag. attributes so once we get the attribute we want I think file name or some attribute is there and this will be file name and then number of claims will be just length of the uh yeah this should be correct and we need to basically Loop or all the files",
  "and we need to basically Loop or all the files for I in range or for uh let us see in this particular folder so if you look at these files it have similar structure P1 file and then hyphen 1 and then hyphen 2y 3 till 20 so for I in range 1 to 21 and we'll have to open all of these again sure so we also need to store file name and then the number of claims we can do lend and then after that we can put it inside the data frame and then we can actually get the maximum one so yeah R doesn't even",
  "get the maximum one so yeah R doesn't even have any doubt on that like I didn't run it but this is the basic structure so so uh it is just similar to XML it also have so XML is similar to uh HTML it have these tags and then these attributes whereas HTML have div htag and then it have attributes like ID then class and then there can be some other custom attributes as so do you save the zip in the C actually your voice is very low sir am I audible now oh yeah you're AUD I'm asking how do you open",
  "now oh yeah you're AUD I'm asking how do you open the file the zip file for it to go to the oh wait wait wait wait yeah I will show you that so so all these multiple files we can select it like this and then we can actually uh put them over here by just copy pasting this is one way it will copy paste all of these one by one one and then another way is we can use our W get to fetch the jip or else we can just upload the jip here instead of loading all these files actually I haven't extracted if",
  "all these files actually I haven't extracted if I extract them then I can just copy paste all of them over here this is one way and then if you have uh uh unzip command and then you can run unzip and then name of that zip file patents dotzip I think this will work we don't have such file uh where is this patent. file present think I need to extract it yeah this have got all these uh files extracted so you can upload this ZIP to the cab and then you can extract it using unzip ah so in tomorrow",
  "you can extract it using unzip ah so in tomorrow session we'll be having one more Ari and then there we'll be showing these different notebooks so you can keep a few notebooks like uh these one let me just share the screen so where is the fourth question yeah for the fourth question you need to create a fast API get endpoint right so just keep few notebooks which have um fast Epi thing and then it have different fun methods like get and then post and then uh these are the two popular functions",
  "and then uh these are the two popular functions which you can keep so these two methods just keep handy so that you can use them so URL encoded parameter keep one snippet of that and then keep on snippet of body uh parameters so from all these sections or different sections like uh oh yeah you can keep something from uh image Library I think it is from week five where we have resize operation and then uh blur operation and then there are multiple operations and then uh you might not need versel",
  "operations and then uh you might not need versel for hosting actually but uh just keep some code ready for local hosting something like that ver like actually it might not be that useful but yeah yeah you should definitely keep some code for let's say local hosting or there is one more option for locally hosting like enro and something like that you can use you should always keep code Snippets ready to go for that purposes so whenever you have been facing you facing that kind of problem simply",
  "facing you facing that kind of problem simply use that code spp and you'll be done with that okay yeah and maybe you might need to run some Dockers then just keep some run and these things handy with you uh running some something inside a container and then exposing ports these kind of things uh will we be require could we be required to actually uh submit Docker container or something not not in 40 minutes right no it might require you to run something inside Docker container but not",
  "to run something inside Docker container but not submitting okay and then uh yeah whatever application you create you must add the these form middle we settings so that it allows request from uh multiple domains so course you need to keep some code for course otherwise it won't work so like that H yeah this is the one middleware which these are the origins which are allowed then these are the methods which are allowed so just keep these things handy [Music] and from ga3 uh so in G3 there is",
  "handy [Music] and from ga3 uh so in G3 there is mostly three things one is uh basic llm calling and then the other one is getting some structure data from llm which is function calling right and then this is the other bit embedding vectors and then finding the cosine similarity and these things this is all that is there and then the other other stuff is this image one so just keep code for this as well in your notebooks which is already here just convert it into some python code or something so",
  "convert it into some python code or something so a lot of Snippets you can get from g g pages so I would recommend you guys to you know just go through all these gas just go through the questions once and uh just uh you know let's try to create Cod Snippets for each and every for each and every tool in ask in these questions okay so let's say we have a convert to PDF to markdown just create a code seate for that extract tables from PDF create a code for that so go through all these GS and then",
  "code for that so go through all these GS and then you will get to know for what all things you have to create your uh your code SE for okay so J do we have something else to express or should we end the session yeah that is it like s can you show one of your Cod files see how to prepare it okay sure sure by the way it's nothing uh it's nothing of that level of of complexity it's simply code Snippets okay so so it's simply just code Snippets of my which I've created this is and all files Cod",
  "my which I've created this is and all files Cod where I have the code for extracting but let's say if I have been given a set of if I been given a folder and they are asking to extract the names of all the files present in the folder and do something some weird stuff with that so if I been given that then I will simply apply this function or you need not create a function you will just you just have to create this for Loop it will just uh iterate over your OS Now list directory and then it will",
  "over your OS Now list directory and then it will just list all the files and you can something that okay then there is something for BBC weather I have uh the API request ready over here simply put in the name of the place you want and then it's ready to go okay so these are the functions that I've created and I would uh so it's your personal preference to either create a function or just create or just have these code NS okay so I have everything ready with me and uh in this beautiful soup",
  "ready with me and uh in this beautiful soup this is going to be the most important forit of your entire preparation just because over here I have paid little attention to Beautiful soap as you can see but I will recommend you guys to create an entire multiple functions for beautiful soup uh I have multiple Snippets for each and every conditions which we we may provide to you okay and uh so beautiful soup is really important for you okay and then I guess this is for HTML extractors so here I'm",
  "I guess this is for HTML extractors so here I'm extracting HTML content uh I guess uh yeah this okay so I'm just listing HTML files I guess then this is Json loader nothing that sort of difficulty over here okay so all these files then HTML llm helper so these are the functions which I've created for llm so this one this one is for embeddings then there are multiple other functions uh to get the models and all that then there is location other stuff as well then there is one file for nominating",
  "as well then there is one file for nominating baret files PDF extractions okay then in back in our time we had Pokemon API we had to do some stuff with Pokemon APA uh which whenever you pass the name of the Pokemon it will return each and every statistics about that entire Pokemon where it fire where it Evo each and everything okay so we had something to do with this Pokemon and uh apparently they have removed this Pokemon thing from your from the term so you need not repare this okay then",
  "the term so you need not repare this okay then there is selenium you haven't been taught selenium it won't come in our as well I guess uh and the sentence Transformers SQL data loading Wikipedia LM extraction so you have to create okay you have to create these quots on yourself by yourself so whatever topics uh used in the Gs I should prepare exactly exactly exactly just head to your GS and look at the topics which you have been talk okay in the first GA itself you were taught about 18 tools",
  "first GA itself you were taught about 18 tools right just prepare quote Snippets for each and every one of and and mind my words I'm not asking you to prepare solutions for these I'm just asking you to prepare a code Snippets for what's going to be used over here okay so yeah so get you should have some code ready for GitHub as well okay then SQL queries is one so you should have something like that yeah reusable Cod but exactly I'm not asking you to create solutions for that that that should",
  "you to create solutions for that that that should be pretty understood this okay so that's what we are asking you and uh that's how moreover even after creating these code Snippets you should be able to you know you should be able to make good use of them as well so I would recommend you guys to create all your code Snippets today and come be done with it by tomorrow evening and attempt the RO we which we're going to release the mock Roe which we're going to release tomorrow with those code",
  "we're going to release tomorrow with those code Snippets okay then you would have a kind of you know uh kind of uh understanding of where my code is and how I have to quickly use it okay then because the thing is that even if you create all these code Snippets you might not be able to use them efficiently okay and that mock which we are going to conduct tomorrow that will if you have all your quot Snippets ready by then and if you use those quot Snippets for tomorrow's mock then you will get",
  "Snippets for tomorrow's mock then you will get the understanding that where you have to you know how you have to coordinate with all these uh uh C Snippets and use them efficiently okay so that was it any other questions um how did you attempted your Ro like was this all enough or you you also had to collaborate with someone no I didn't collaborate with anyone I did it all by myself okay yeah and all these code Snippets were all these code Snippets were pretty sufficient and always I would",
  "were pretty sufficient and always I would recommend you always have chat GPT open in other windows and moreover uh because the thing is that chat GPT on a free trial gives you uh only few it's it's allows you only about 10 messages to be sent okay so uh on its on it on the model which is the best one okay so on the premium model it allows only 10 messages so I would recommend you guys to create multiple IDs on chat GPT and whenever one is exhausted simply switch to another one and uh then you",
  "simply switch to another one and uh then you it okay because you would genuinely uh you would uh want to get the best response rather than getting a response from a lower version model okay that's one thing you should you should also explore deep seek that's a really good Ai and I will recommend you guys to just explore deep seek if you haven't yet and have deep seek ready as well have gini ready as well have all your API Keys ready okay create a virtual environment so over here in this Roe I",
  "a virtual environment so over here in this Roe I have my virtual environment over here and each and every Library I'm using so there are dozens of libraries I have installed so you can say that I am just scrolling and scrolling and it's not ending right so I've installed multiple libraries in this entire uh EnV because at that point of time you won't be you know it would be a very bad idea to get getting start getting to install all these libraries okay you should have all your libraries",
  "libraries okay you should have all your libraries installed in a virtual environment and always always always create a virtual environment okay so create a virtual environment install everything which you have come across yet okay and then prepare your Cod snippits all right and also name your C snippit efficiently okay so as you can see that the naming which I have used it's Pokemon API PDF extraction sentence Transformer this is this is so it's you know once I read the name I will be able to",
  "you know once I read the name I will be able to get okay so this is this for this is for this this for this this is for this okay so uh yeah so always have you know have your code ready and name your files pretty well and uh I will seriously recommend you guys to get all your code Subs ready by tomorrow evening and use your code Snippets in tomorrow's mock room okay so this is a privilege that you guys are getting these mock Roes because never have we ever done this never have we ever had mock",
  "we ever done this never have we ever had mock Roes in uh TDS and this is the first time we are doing it and you guys are pretty privileged for that and uh yeah so uh that's all I have to say any other questions at what time we be having at what time I guess it would be 85 uh 7505 we'll release okay okay so it's 7:15 actually uh my bad so 8 8 at 8 we are going to start the session so it's 7:15 we are going to release the RO tomorrow and then you have to get started okay use this opportunity",
  "you have to get started okay use this opportunity wisely okay that's all I have to say any other questions should we end s okay so for the file uh for the snippet file it's better to actually do it in vs code now instead of doing it in Google collab or maybe a absolutely I would I always uh you know why I always recommend vs code because you know Google collab is also good but what happens is that sometimes uh the limitation over is over there is that it doesn't save your files okay let's say",
  "is that it doesn't save your files okay let's say you have created a session you have imported all your files over there and let's say it's a really huge file okay it's about uh there are multiple files and then it's taking time to upload them okay and suddenly something happens and you close that window all that is gone okay you have to re-upload your files you have to rerun your functions so always always in these kind of scenarios when you are time bound always use V schol okay and moreover",
  "time bound always use V schol okay and moreover have these llm helpers with you these codm GitHub copilot so these llm really help you guys okay so have these ready this exam is entirely open book you are allowed to use any kind of GPT or AI help so use it to your full to the full extent okay so install this codium extension and or get a profil that's up to you I prefer Podium so yeah any other questions any other questions guys well I guess uh we have run out of questions and we have run off",
  "we have run out of questions and we have run off we have run out of time as well okay so it was a pretty good session guys I hope you learned just want to ask one is coding is an extension yeah it's an extension you need not download it any from anywhere just simply go over to this extension stab and go type just Cod this is the this is the one okay so there are actually two okay you can see that there are actually two but this is the real one Podium AI coding this green one is the real one",
  "Podium AI coding this green one is the real one this purple one I'm not sure about okay so okay it's something else actually it's another tool it's kind of updat or something you need you need not install that install this green one okay and uh yeah okay so let's end the session guys it was a pretty good session I hope you learned a lot from it and uh yeah we had a pretty good time as well all right guys we'll meet tomorrow get ready with your quits and attempt attempt tomorrow's Mock and then",
  "and attempt attempt tomorrow's Mock and then we'll discuss it okay so bye guys please stop the recording and",

  ">> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. Well, that's happening. Can someone also just confirm that that streaming is working because sometimes there's some issues with that.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: Hi. Good evening, Carlton.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, good evening.  >> AMAN DHOL: The stream is working. So  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, okay. >> Ritwik Trivedi: Yeah, excellent. Just  >> Carlton D'Silva: Right. Okay next all right, so So the greening once again, so today's session will be split into two parts.",
  "so today's session will be split into two parts. The first part of the session will be I'll be talking through some of the key  things that will be important for your ROI. Some of the key technologies to focus on  very because there's a lot, right? So not every not, every tiny little detail is important for you to to learn, but there are some key things that you that will  be valuable as you prepare for. So that's the first part of the session. And also go over some concepts that I in will be",
  "And also go over some concepts that I in will be important for, for you, an arya partly, because many people struggle with it and partly, because  they are important key learning. And they are new, this term compared to previous terms. So some of those things I will go over and then the second part of the session jivraj and saransh will be going through  the solution of today's mock. So that will be the second part of the session. So, Let me now share my screen.  Okay, so I hope the screen is",
  "share my screen.  Okay, so I hope the screen is visible.  okay, so the first things first, of course,  the Rohit checklist. It seems obvious code editor, right? So you might think What am I talking about? So for most of you, it might be VS code. But some of you may decide to use  Google collab, for example.  My strong preference is vs code, and the reasons for that is simple vs code. You  can install all sorts of extensions that can help you in doing darui. I hope you've seen a demonstration of",
  "darui. I hope you've seen a demonstration of that. When jivraj and saransh did a mock live  ROI for the first one, where speed is key, right? So you want to have all your tools available from the Get go  said that some people have done it using colab. I'm not against it if you're comfortable with Kohler, that's good. Just be aware of one caveat Google Collab. If there is a problem, some network connection issue or something like that. And if you've got a runtime that is on Google, Call app, if",
  "got a runtime that is on Google, Call app, if you have uploaded files into the runtime, then that runtime may vanish, right? If there is some network issue and then you may lose some of your work, since there is no time to lose work again. This is the reason why I prefer Code, What are the advantages of Google collab? So, the advantage, there is an  advantage of Google Collab. The advantage is that you will be able to run a lot of libraries without having to install them, right? So, it's if you",
  "having to install them, right? So, it's if you need, for example,  pandas or whatever, some various common libraries are there, right? So Google Collab. Generally by default has them already pre-installed. So that's the trade-off. But of course, there's easy way to get around it. You can install On your local system, right? So that's the way to get around that issue. So that's something to keep in mind.  So, that's regarding the the code editor. Now, in the code editor, you want some essential",
  "Now, in the code editor, you want some essential extensions already there, okay? Obviously Python because most of you be using Python but you can use your Choice of  language that you like to work in. It doesn't matter. Whatever your family would see, plus, plus Java, whatever you JavaScript anything. But  basically have your extensions for them ready. And for example, Jupiter notebooks ready, because you want to test some snippets very quickly without  running the entire code base.  JavaScript",
  "running the entire code base.  JavaScript is another key technology, partly? Because you're going to be working with Web pages inevitably right at some point, there may be some web scraping or something. So, just having some  JavaScript extensions in your VS code is useful. Again things to pass HTML XML those are useful. requests, This is a very  request. This is this is quite valuable okay to be able to make API requests. So requests to an endpoint to test something you're deployed request to",
  "to test something you're deployed request to  an online endpoint, like Pokemon or something like that of that nature or request to make to the LLM. For example, these are good to be able to do easily. So, having either a snippet code,  Or some extension that does that for you very quickly and so they're able to  view its contents quickly is good. Having said that you can also do this in the Dev Tools console, right? So  That's something to keep in mind an extension to view DBS, very useful, you",
  "mind an extension to view DBS, very useful, you  want to quickly look at a DB file without having to first extract or load it into a data frame. Just so that you get a sense of a is this DB something where I can quickly grab some information from right? Can I filter it out quickly just by  looking at the view, you know, sometimes maybe that may help, right? You don't  have to write any code, you may be able to get the answer quickly. And as I've said in previous terms, speed is life in in our",
  "said in previous terms, speed is life in in our own, right? If you don't have speed, then you're gonna struggle with that. Just everything is geared towards  doing things. Same way, let's CSV viewer. You may think. Why do I need a CSV view again? Same reason you can quickly identify if there are issues or things like that, it's always handy to have an extension, which is a CSU I won't recommend very specific ones. You've seen them in past sessions so I'm not going to talk about it extensively",
  "so I'm not going to talk about it extensively again. Something to look at Jsons, right? That's can be useful when you're looking at a very complex JSON, body structure from some data set that we are giving you sometimes to be able to parse it quickly. It may just help to have a visual reference to it so you stick the visual reference on the right side of the screen and on the left side of  In, you can type in quickly your code that is trying to get through the JSON. in a very quick way so that",
  "get through the JSON. in a very quick way so that you can get to the data that you're looking for. So JSON viewer is helpful. Pdf you. I mean this might sound stupid right? You can say okay, I can just  click on a PDF, open it in a window. That's true but there's an extension in VS code that lets you view the PDF right there in the VS code, right? So you don't have to click anywhere and open a whole new window or don't do window jumping or things. As you as you just click one by one in the",
  "As you as you just click one by one in the various files you can  immediately instantly look at the videos, right? So that can be helpful. So one good example, for that is so you you all know you might have seen that data set, where you have to extract PDFs of  What you call for the student marks and things of that. So, but when you look at  the, when you just try to do the extraction directly into pandas in the past, this is in a GA, right? So you have plenty of time and you can examine the",
  "you have plenty of time and you can examine the data very easily, but many students,  On each and every page had a new header table. I mean, I had a new header row and so pandas does. Well, although they extracted it wire, tabula when they extracted it, they didn't realize that Wanda's Khan parse it properly, because  there are these obnoxious header rows in the pandas data frame, repeated, every 30 rows, right? But if you had actually viewed the PDF, you would have seen it straight away,",
  "the PDF, you would have seen it straight away, right? And you would have known to adjust for that. So, having a PDF viewer to quickly run through things is also useful extension This is quite good. Okay. Data Wrangler. This is something fairly new. Microsoft put it out. I think, maybe a year ago, this has multiple ways of  pivoting, your tables, and pivoting on columns, and looking at data values in a table. Okay, so for example, it'll tell you, so many Nan's are there so many this is there.",
  "so many Nan's are there so many this is there. What is the most common value? All sorts of cool things will be there. Yeah so have a look at this extension data and might might prove useful to you might prove the difference between getting an answer quickly or spending time getting an answer.  Having an AI assistant as an extension super useful. This is not IntelliSense that I'm talking about. I'm talking about like something like co-pilot or codium codium is free. You can install, the",
  "or codium codium is free. You can install, the extension people from the BS program. Use it extensively for in BS code. I highly recommend CODIUM. So CO E, I u m and I written here. A genetic is better.  So there is a new vs. I shouldn't say new, but there is a different version of vs code available called vs code insiders. Okay, if you install that, And you get your  Co-pilot Extensions On. There you are able to set the AI into agent mode, which  is actually very good if you want to iterate or",
  "is actually very good if you want to iterate or code very rapidly. What I mean by that, normally when you write code, what's going to happen is you're going to write some code. Then you find an error, you'll copy the code, paste the code into GPT. Get a response back, copy it back into your thing. Try it out. that always time, right? But if you have it in a genetic mode, right? Your AI assistant. Then in the VS code itself, right there will be a like a little sidecar window  open on the side.",
  "a like a little sidecar window  open on the side. And in vs code itself you can type a prompt, okay? And it has the your AI assistant has the context of your program. It's able to look at a program, you type the prompt and say Hey I want you to fix this in this program and in real time it's going to  A correct, your code in the Code window itself. So there's no copy pasting back and forth and it says tons of time. And you can iterate way, way, more rapidly. if it's in a genetic mode, okay? So",
  "more rapidly. if it's in a genetic mode, okay? So that is something that that can be a lifesaver.  You know, you might instead of getting say 50 marks, you may get 70 marks because of that. So it's really worth.  And finally Github extensions because I don't know, maybe the ROI might require  you to clone a github repo may require you to push something to a github repo. So of course, you can do that in the terminal. No problem. But as I've  demonstrated in one of the sessions before, when you",
  "in one of the sessions before, when you have an extension and github and it's all configured correctly, it's very trivial. You just press a button and it's all done. Right. So a github extensions, have it on there and know how to use all these things. Like, just having them on there is not going to do your Rohit for you, right? But know how to use. So, that's with regards to the code editor. The next aspect of it, is Create a Separate Folder for ROI. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes a",
  "ROI. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes a difference, right? So create a separate folder for in. What do you keep in that folder? Keep some organized code snippets. So at this point, I'm going to talk  about what you need to have in your code snippets so that you can really do well in this hour. So the first, so there,  or main parts to an Rohit, you always going to get some data set and the first part is data extraction, the next part is some cleaning and transformation the  next part is",
  "cleaning and transformation the  next part is some data analysis in the last part is some deployment, right? So, Your code snippets, should be organized in that way. So, for example, although data extraction you can have pandas, in data extraction, you don't put all your  pandas code up at the very in one big file, just for pandas, right? Maybe organize them in terms of data express, this file will have all my data  extraction work. If there is some pandas code that does data extraction, great",
  "some pandas code that does data extraction, great have it in there, you know, then have a separate file for data, cleaning and transform because these are going to be separate things that you do right at each stage. So you want to segregate your code in a way that makes logical  sense, rather than having everything clubbed into one big. massive sort of who, right of code. So that's not going to help you. So,  Data Extraction. So what does data extraction law? We're going to almost I can almost",
  "law? We're going to almost I can almost guarantee you, right? Every term there's going to be some HTML or some XML scraping of some sort, right? When I say HTML slash XML. I mean something with tags, right? So I'm not going to explain what they are. You should know by now, what they look like, but something with tag and a tree structure, so  something in a tree structure and with tax You're going to almost face that almost every arrow, right? So the tools to do that beautiful soup and you know",
  "the tools to do that beautiful soup and you know what Excel can also do it to a certain extent. So you may find Excel useful, so excel. Sometimes you can give it a page and it may have a table and you may need to extract it and the table may be ugly. Okay? In terms of trying to extract it using beautiful so maybe okay but Excel might be able to do it in a jiffy. So it's worth  >> AMAN DHOL: You know. >> Carlton D'Silva: what knowing how to do that. Just give it a try. Okay. So that you at least",
  "Just give it a try. Okay. So that you at least familiar to how to do it before the are.  >> AMAN DHOL: Set. >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes. Sorry someone was  >> AMAN DHOL: Yeah, I actually I was just trying to say that Excel isn't like wasn't really useful in this mocks because all of those HTML HTML documents which are supposed to scrape had sub links and I don't think Excel really does a good job  there. Because we had to, we have to then then we have to manually, put all the links and using use",
  "have to manually, put all the links and using use import HTML and all that.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, I mean the marks so far didn't have it that's true but that doesn't mean it can't be used in a future mock. Right? What I'm saying is you just have to be  aware that sometimes there is an easy way to do something.  and you may end up trying to do it the difficulty. A good example is I think session to mock. Yeah,  mock two in mock two. There were some table info tabular information available",
  "some table info tabular information available  in, I think, in one of the questions, okay? But of course, you could try and scrape. Out and some students try to scrape it out. I think Andrew and some other students like that, try to scrape it out using beautiful soup, okay? They copy pasted the thing. Then they went through the parsing and it took them a long time. But you know what? If they're just put it in Excel they would have got it  within two seconds, right? Instead of spending 10",
  "within two seconds, right? Instead of spending 10 minutes on it or five minutes on  So don't dismiss out of hand, that excel can't be useful. Even in mocks, it can be useful. So, even in scraping so,  what I would advise this you try some normal sites that are out there, right? Which have some tabular information on them and use Excel's import.  I think it's like a data query. They have a Data Query tab. Use the Data Query tab, and try to import things in there. If it's in Macos, the  Excel",
  "things in there. If it's in Macos, the  Excel uses, I think the query function to do it. And if it is in Windows, then they have a separate button for for it. So, both are able to do it. It's just they do, it's slightly differently but it's worth knowing how to do it just so  that you can. Extract things very quickly. You may find it useful. I'm not saying every mock is going to work with Excel. That's would not be right, but sometimes it may  come handy. Same thing with Google sheets. Okay?",
  "come handy. Same thing with Google sheets. Okay? Google sheets, believe it or not, if you give it for example, an expert, okay? I don't know how many of, you  know what XPath is, but if you give it an expert, right? It's actually able to scrape out or import information. if they are given, if it's given a clear X bar, So again something that may be worth one and may take you just a few seconds. instead of several minutes. so things to keep in mind, dynamic side sleeping, now, this thing has we",
  "dynamic side sleeping, now, this thing has we have torn down the dynamic side. Scraping scraping in recent walks partly because it's very, very difficult to do, but that does not  mean it doesn't come. Okay? Sometimes we do have you scrape dynamic sites. So, what will help you in those situations just knowing the basic JavaScript that get you CSS, selectors to select elements out of the code, right? That will help you. I'm not going to talk about selenium but those of you want to experiment and",
  "selenium but those of you want to experiment and have some time to experiment with you can try selenium and of course this is something that someone lost I think, two terms ago, shortly there are believe it or not, there are some browser extensions that actually help you with scraping  data out of out of the site out of real life sites. So this is something you can try it out. Just only thing I would say be careful of is not all extensions are safe, so I can't vouch for the safety of these",
  "safe, so I can't vouch for the safety of these extensions so that is something to keep in mind. But I was pretty impressed that a browser extension can help you, okay? So that's something to keep in. PDF. Scraping every term almost virtually. I can guarantee you. There's going to  be some kind of scraping with regards to PDF. Does that mean it will definitely  come this ROI? No, I cannot say that. But PDF scraping by and large always quite often there are, and you're seeing them in the box. So,",
  "there are, and you're seeing them in the box. So, having this code  snippets and the new thing, this term is these two things, right? The PI Move  PDF and in particularly converting a PDF into markdown this this is kind of a new thing. So we generally do test 10 to test you on new things. So keep code ready? It's not difficult. It's just having the code snippet, ready? That's all it is, right? So get the code snippet ready and use it once, right? Don't test it out in your rohit, use it once",
  "Don't test it out in your rohit, use it once before just to give it so that you know it works and it's great.  Okay, and again, believe it or not Excel, can scrape PDFs, sometimes? So that's something you can try, okay? In data extraction, obviously several times. Now, you have seen in more many marks as well. There's going to be a DB file it. Most likely will be an SQLite  lite file. So, that's something you would want to know how to extract and load into a panda's data frame typically. So",
  "and load into a panda's data frame typically. So that's something that you need to know how to do and have quotes in a picture that On parsing. Okay, if you don't know,  How JSON is structured if you don't know how JSON is passed? If you don't, if you're not comfortable with,  Please, please practice it. It will really  save your. Are we, right? Because almost always. There are some sort of JSON data in the right. So, Be very, very, very comfortable with JSON, okay? A markdown there can be",
  "with JSON, okay? A markdown there can be marked down files that you may need to extract. So be familiar with how markdown files go. For example, you may need to extract the headings of of a topic, right? So the headings are, of course, can someone tell me how we're headings marked and mark term?  >> AMAN DHOL: yash is  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> 24F2003130 SHAMBHAVI VERMA: That.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. So  one hash is the top level heading to ashes is a second level heading and so on and",
  "to ashes is a second level heading and so on and so forth. Lists are done with dashes at the beginning of a line. those sorts of things, right? So just be familiar with the basic basic concepts of  Markdown. Okay.  then encodings encodings when I'm talking about, encodings I'm talking about from an extraction point of view I'm talking about. What can someone tell me what I'm talking about? Be interesting to see how many people know this.  >> Ritwik Trivedi: something.  >> AMAN DHOL: One.  >>",
  "Trivedi: something.  >> AMAN DHOL: One.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes. So there was a module available. It was in, I think it was, I don't. Yeah.  week one and it talked about encodings right about Unicode and there's a fantastic video. if you haven't watched it till now it's worth watching. And the reason I mentioned this is So, it happened to me to myself today itself, okay? When I was partly preparing for this session, one of the things I was trying to do was I was trying to extract a CSV that I",
  "to do was I was trying to extract a CSV that I got from somewhere and guess what Pandas didn't wasn't able to read it. And then,  I remembered. Oh, yeah, maybe there's an encoding problem. So because when I looked at the CSV when I did all the examination, everything looks fine, right? It's in fact, at Kaggle data set, But it's not reading in pandas data.  So immediately I thought I need to find out what the encoding is. So I Wrote a code snippet. That told me what the encoding is and I then",
  "That told me what the encoding is and I then found out what it was and then it loaded it into pandas data frames without age. So that's what I'm talking about when I'm saying in Codex, right UTF-8. And there is a windows encoding which always causes trouble and things of that. So that's what I'm talking about when I say Again, it's not big, big things just be aware and have code ready for that, right? So, in fact,  Maybe I can.  See, just give me one. Just two seconds. Yeah. So this is a good",
  "me one. Just two seconds. Yeah. So this is a good example.  Yeah. Okay. Is this visible?  Yeah, so you see this code over here? This code all it does. Right? Is it  Okay. It tries to detect what character set it has and then it tells me, okay? then coding is this and it tells with what confidence level it believes that's then. Good. That's all it is, right? I have a snippet like this handy so that in case you run into an extraction problem, where you think hey, the CSV looks fine. everything",
  "you think hey, the CSV looks fine. everything looks fine, why is Pointer struggling? It may be an encoding point, right? We may throw in these little Curbots because that's part of what we test you, right? So so that's that's an example. Let's get back to.  Okay.  Yeah, the biggest stickers have chords and if it's already, that's true. But also the kind of code snippets. You need is hopefully what I hope you're  getting out of this session, okay? That will be useful because there's so many",
  "okay? That will be useful because there's so many things out there, right? You would be difficult for you to organize. If you didn't know how to organize. And what to what you need. And I'll also highlight things that are particularly important.  Okay, so Llm Apk this, obviously, I should not have to remind you about this. I have llm api is ready to do, chat completions and embeddings right. We're  getting them buildings when you provide it, an array of words or word or whatever it is right.",
  "array of words or word or whatever it is right. Have these API calls ready. You will require.  Llms almost certainly because it's a big important thing. So have that, right? So that covers your data extraction point, the next bit is Data cleaning and transformation. Data Cleaning and transformation. I put bash commands here some common examples. You've seen them in GH, right? So, for example, moving renaming files.  Um these are some they seem like silly mundane tasks but they are quite useful,",
  "silly mundane tasks but they are quite useful, okay? And in fact, let me To sure I have it here. Yes. Okay, so there is this. Okay, I'll just copy paste this for you. There's a cheat sheet available. Okay I'll put it in the chat.  So this is a cheat sheet for some basic bash commands, right? And You may think Okay well like and use a GPT to get things done in bash. That's true, but just the problem is, when GPT Spitzer something you may not necessarily recognize what it's fitting out. And if",
  "recognize what it's fitting out. And if something go and in bash is very unforgiving, right? Even something slightly off is going to make it give you the wrong output. So, unless you're familiar with what those batch commands are supposed to be  doing, you will not be able to diagnose. What's wrong with the Gupta output and outings. So that's why I just put your basket. I'm not telling you to become experts at  bash because that's not realistic, but it may it may come useful. Okay. So working",
  "but it may it may come useful. Okay. So working with sets of files because we may provide some sets of files and we may say, Okay we need you to organize them in this particular fashion in rapid  order. So you're not going to sit there and type things out or you're not going to load it into Python and try and do it that way that just takes way too long. What? We'll do it quickly and affect effectively. Some bash commands, like  moving, renaming whatever, creating new files, things like that,",
  "whatever, creating new files, things like that, okay? Obviously this is a big one, right? Pandas right data, cleaning transformation. Now going to talk about it, enough said, it's there everywhere. Learn how to use all its functions.  in particular, if you've done MLP, for example, or ml T,  The preprocessing part, right? How to clean data, how to  deal with nans, how to find, which are columns that have numbers or text in them, or things of that. So, right, value counts all those sorts of",
  "that. So, right, value counts all those sorts of things pre-processing. All of that. Be very, very familiar with that, okay? In pointers  Okay, next thing. Okay, great. Thanks, David. Okay. Now next you might be running, what is  Network X? If you have a tendered, any of the mocks, I'm hoping you already know what  this is. So some of the data, right? So most of the data we deal with this  either tabular format or it's some structured JSON or unstructured semi-structed days on or whatever or",
  "unstructured semi-structed days on or whatever or some unstructed, This is another form of not network specifically, but another form of data is data can be in the form of graphs, right? So things with links and weights and  things of that. So so if they're in graphs, you want to be able to the most common thing you want to find in a graph is the relationship between two items, right? How far they are, how close they are. What's the quickest way? Whatever it is.  And the the one library that",
  "Whatever it is.  And the the one library that really does. It fantastically well, very simple way is networking, right? So  I would highly recommend if you still haven't, it's been in the MOX, if you haven't done the MOX, try out the mock. That does the, that uses Network X?  To deal with graph data, okay? Data that requires you to use different points to get to different things and Things, that's all. So yeah, network X. Okay, data cleaning this again. Shouldn't go with, you know. Should I",
  "this again. Shouldn't go with, you know. Should I shouldn't have to say this Excel and Google sheets can be super useful for data clean. And VS code, This may sound strange. But if you go to the first week, right first week, there was a fantastic video that Anand actually had. I think it was Anand word than the video, was it? Not I'm not sure. But there is a video in the  first week and it showed how you can use VS code to do some simple transformations on large amounts of data very quickly.",
  "on large amounts of data very quickly. And in fact, I think there was a GA even asked you to do it. I'm not sure, but in case you don't find that ga, if you go to last terms, GA 1, okay, there was some there was a particular Jade question. Which required you to transform some data? Yeah, a multi cursor. That's it. Yeah. Multi cursor. So learn how to use the multi cursor. It can actually help you in.  It may help you in an arrow right? Insert spending loads of time doing something, you may be",
  "loads of time doing something, you may be able to do the transformations. So rapidly you don't have to load it into a pandas or anything and you may be able to solve this. So just be, you know, aware of that. Yeah. Yeah. >> Ritwik Trivedi: Is something coming to my mind? Can I maybe eds rate, If this is one subject which is so difficult, it should have the option of doing it into terms. Carry forward.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, okay. I then the other thing about data cleaning and",
  "I then the other thing about data cleaning and transformation, I put it under this because I didn't have a good place to put it base 64 encoding. So that's basically to deal with images. Right? So have some code. Snippets ready for dealing with images and that includes anything? I haven't written it here, but like, you know, the PIL library and things of that sort.  for just some image transformations. Basic things like that. So, in fact, interesting base 64 encodings what I should say is image",
  "base 64 encodings what I should say is image transformations, but part of it is also knowing how to do basically going, right? Because we may ask you to, okay, send  this encoding to the API endpoint. So, how do you convert an image into a base 60? Current code? Something useful to know. Okay, the next bit.  Data analysis and will very soon wrap up.  with some little bit of code, and things that I want to show you. So data has obviously, again, pandas, the big one here, okay, Network X data",
  "pandas, the big one here, okay, Network X data analysis, Google Sheets.  Here, I've added one more thing, psychic. Learn the reason I've had this is in  previous sorrow, is not necessarily the most recent ones. But sometimes You may be asked to do something, which I could learn. So like, do some  clustering or something of that nature. So I've just briefly mentioned it here. Don't need some big sports snippets for this, but just be aware of this library exists and it's able to do some some form",
  "library exists and it's able to do some some form for some forms of ML type tasks and things of that sort. So just people install and keep it in  case you require it, right?  Because it's a kind of a big library and it takes time to don't things. But yeah. So I mentioned this mainly because  Sometimes, sometimes they may have some tasks that involve it again us when it  comes. When I. So the reason I've written SQL separately from SQLite and duct TV  With data analysis. So there is a site",
  "duct TV  With data analysis. So there is a site called SQL Zoo. I hope some of you have already gone through it. I highly recommend it to at least do the basics over there because it will help you diagnose. Simple problems with SQL. So I've written it separately, so SQL queries, turn the basic basics of how to do them. And then I've written SQLite and Duck DB so you'll need code snippets  to open SQLite, files and duct DB files. Perhaps right? SQL queries to them in order to be able to get some",
  "queries to them in order to be able to get some information out.  Llm embeddings. Okay. I can't stress this enough, right? Llms are a big thing.  Even if you don't do anything else in Roe, right? I'm almost certain there's going to be at least one LLM question or two element questions minimum okay and almost certain  you know, the I suspect that, you know, embeddings are going to be very important. Why? Because embeddings Help you do lots of things and it's something. One of the key examples is",
  "and it's something. One of the key examples is embeddings will help you. For example access an offline database, right? A database, that's internal to  the company and be able to run a query using that In-house database. But without sending it to the  To the what you call for 2gbt, or some other llm. So the way they complex that is using like Raj and all these sorts of things and so llm embeddings going to circle this many times.  Okay. LLM embeddings has code snippets ready to deal most likely",
  "has code snippets ready to deal most likely the most  common can someone okay can someone tell me what an LLM embedding task usually is.  >> AMAN DHOL: Landing similarity between two texts or something. >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct. That's all it is, right? It's finding similarity between two words or to give in lines of text or to documents finding the similarity. That's all it boils down. So almost certainly, there's always going to be some sort of testing all in these sorts of things. Okay,",
  "of testing all in these sorts of things. Okay, next. Okay. So so these are the major parts right now. Something that's new this term. Is going to be.  Data deployment. We never had it in previous terms so I guarantee you If you have taught something new, you're almost certainly going to test you on it. And deployment was in week two. So, that shows how important on things deployment is. So if you're not good with deployment or you struggled in project, one with deployment now would be a really",
  "one with deployment now would be a really good time to organize your code snippets. To do basic deployments, right? So what do I mean by deployment? Write some  piece of code, you will have it running as a service that service will need to  be accessible outside your system, and that's what a deployment is, right? So keep that in mind. So github again. All that sort of thing. then so I've written fast API mainly because that even the demo that I have ready for you today is also using plastic",
  "I have ready for you today is also using plastic but  what it really means, what I'm really trying to say is some sort of HTTP server that responds to endpoints, right? It can be any technology you want, it doesn't matter. Okay. Learn how to create some. And endpoints that.  That can be accessed, right? Some HEY access while using some sort of server HTTP server, in that you want to be familiar with GET and post methods at the very minimum, almost certainly, you will not see other ones, okay?",
  "certainly, you will not see other ones, okay? Put and delete and all I would not pay attention to if they, if it does turn up, you can always use GP2 to help you with those but understand what I get request is. How do you send parameters to get requests? Understand what a post request is? This is very important, know the difference between the two and what and here's the other thing you can send parameters to a post request in the URL itself, that is  possible but you can. But you also send for",
  "is  possible but you can. But you also send for a data to through post requests  using a JSON audience, so learn how to do both, okay? That's really important again, how to deal with the query parameters that come through yet and post, Then of course, once you get a query, you have to send a response back, right? So this is one place where many people in project ripped up. Everyone was trying to send a response and they were sending back JSON responses whereas the questions actually wanted",
  "responses whereas the questions actually wanted plain text responses, right? So I'll go through that in more detail in. I'll actually go through data deployment in more detail, in just a few minutes.  Um, so yeah. How do you do these responses properly very important. Okay, you got your server, any great. It's running on your local computer, great, but it's  of no use to man or beast. If it's stuck inside your machine right? Someone today is a collaborative world today. You you know your",
  "is a collaborative world today. You you know your clients need to see the end result. Your boss needs to see the end result you're working from home,  whatever it is right? You need to be able to see the output somewhere else  remotely. So knowing how to couple End grock tuning service with your server. It's an important technology too. We will test. We want to test you on how to  do deployment. So that means knowing the full stack of the plan creating the the service and running the  In the",
  "creating the the service and running the  In the same way, you have Docker and Portman and I won't talk much about dock and Portman because it's been covered extensively in previous sessions and it takes a little bit more time to talk about those things. So I'm not going to talk about document today. Watch some of the project sessions if you want. In fact, I would say What's the very last project session? Yeah to get an idea of talk and Quad man and then Jivraj also had demonstrated very well",
  "and then Jivraj also had demonstrated very well into the project. And then, of course, data deployment, you know, sometimes output needs to be in markdown files. So I've just written that here as a, you know, just  something to keep in mind that data deployment. Be all sorts of formats. Right? So it doesn't necessarily mean markdown but it just means that it could be JSON. For example, it could be anything else. So but I've just written markup, okay? So that wraps up, how you prepare, your code",
  "So that wraps up, how you prepare, your code snippet files and how you organize them. Keep it like I said, Well organized don't dump everything in one big blob and so that's And they got to that, okay? Before I go to the very next section, which will be  largely talking about data deployment. Because it's fairly new any questions over.  >> AMAN DHOL: Nope.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Was.  >> SHIVAM DUBEY: We are not able to install a chrome extensions in like due to the characterist sections of the",
  "in like due to the characterist sections of the organization.  In our browser. So can you change that setting or something?  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry, I didn't quite understand. You say that again?  >> SHIVAM DUBEY: That's we are not able to go like install, the Chrome extensions or access the Chrome web store.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay, okay. Yeah. >> SHIVAM DUBEY: Due to the,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Ah, you mean when you're using  Using Chrome Browser with your with you logged in as your it",
  "Browser with your with you logged in as your it might.  >> SHIVAM DUBEY: Yeah, yes. But >> Sarthak Singh Gaur: Yes, student ID.  >> SHIVAM DUBEY: the problem is that, I think the data will be randomized with the email ID command, so if we like access it with other, so wanted change the results.  >> Carlton D'Silva: so, You don't have to say, you don't have to. So when you log in normally, right, You don't have to What's the word I'm looking for?  Many. Yeah. >> Ritwik Trivedi: to chrome using",
  "Many. Yeah. >> Ritwik Trivedi: to chrome using items, if you directly.  login from it, madrasi even using a processing profile that works.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, that's what I was trying to say in short. Yes. So there are ways around it so you can get some friends to help you out with that. Okay, maybe later, you  can ask it, we can demonstrate that. I won't spend time on that because that's something you can do also outside this because I've got something important to show. Okay. >>",
  "I've got something important to show. Okay. >> SHIVAM DUBEY: Thank you.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Um, right. Okay. Now, this is not my favorite way of doing teaching sessions, but For today, for the sake of speed, I'm going to do it this way, all right.  Things that you should already. Have ready on your system, okay? Is for example UV, right? So that if you want to run a deployment service,  then you want to be able to run an application file.  and it won't be a notebook, right? It's going to be a",
  "it won't be a notebook, right? It's going to be a PI file to run an application. So have UV installed. Of course, you can do it using PIP as well. but then what can someone tell me the advantage of having UV versus doing it by  >> AMAN DHOL: All of those different command.  >> RAGHU VASANTH RAO: Don't need to install library.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct. So in ROA speed is important, right? So all you have to do  Yeah.  >> Ritwik Trivedi: That if it is important and like, because even if we're",
  "it is important and like, because even if we're on UV, you still installs the libraries in runtime, right?  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, so there is a way to get around that problem. You can of course, run your scripts with all sorts of dependencies once you will cache all those. And so  when it comes to the actual ROI, it will do it, you know, virtually instantly, right? So, that's one way to get around it. And if you're missing something, it  doesn't matter. Because all you do is you put the put",
  "matter. Because all you do is you put the put it in your requests up here, right? In your script file here and it will just draw the one that needs additional files, right? And then it will run everything else so it creates the virtual environment it gets the  dependencies and run your script all in one flash, right? So it's very, very fast, very, very useful. So that's why have you we run, okay? Some common things to have in order for deployment past API and you have to use this exactly, this",
  "past API and you have to use this exactly, this way, with this square bracket standard, are they, some of you will run? That error that says past API is not. That's because this is the actual dependency fast API in square bracket standard.  UV con to obviously run the HTTP server pandas always, is going to be useful. requests to make requests, okay? so,  then the next part of it is You need a fast API application, right? So, there's the application there. Okay. Is it clear? Yeah, my screen is",
  "there. Okay. Is it clear? Yeah, my screen is clear, right? It's very visible to you, right? Oops.  But okay.  so so you create the Fast APA application and then the next important bit is  being able to deal with course because if the site the exam site requires you to  send some information or run some service, and it's going to send some requests to your service.  it's going to come from off-site, right? So you will need some course enabled for it. Someone had a question. Hello. >> SIVANS:",
  "for it. Someone had a question. Hello. >> SIVANS: Hello, good evening, sir.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. Yeah. >> SIVANS: Yes sir I have a question, sir. Like I saw the more carries affili yesterday. today is spending. Oh, I figured out there are small questions given, but in the beginning, it was told that the questions may differ their pattern of the question may differ from these. Just take these for your  reference do not stick on them. so, can  can we get like you told that in this term we",
  "can we get like you told that in this term we have started data deployment, so can we get some project? Also a small project in the Where we need to show data. >> Carlton D'Silva: no, no, you won't get a project in the exam you will, but you will definitely be tested on deployment, right? Because we spent, there's a whole module on deployment. So, 100% guarantee you. There's going to be a question on deployment. Right. >> SIVANS: Okay. So end up my board can be  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, but",
  "up my board can be  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, but it does see that. The thing is, I know it sounds daunting, right? But believe it or not, you know, this file that I've created for today's  demonstration. It barely took hardly a few minutes to do this. That's because I'm familiar with it, right? So that's what I'm telling you to do, become familiar with the main components, you and have the code snippets already. Then you can tweak it and run your service, right? So that's what I'm trying to",
  "your service, right? So that's what I'm trying to show you today. so,  >> SIVANS: okay, so for that only we do  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry I they're not very clear. >> SIVANS: I'll just  So, I'll just revisit week, two course data, where the whole day data deployment  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes. >> SIVANS: courses taught. So that would that  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, it will help you at least solve a question or two. Yeah and in fact this session might also help you so that's why I'm going through",
  "also help you so that's why I'm going through it in particular, okay? So >> SIVANS: Thank you, sir.  >> Carlton D'Silva: so here you have the API, okay? Fast API, remember you want to have the cores enabled? So the settings are important, right? This star means you are allowing requests from any domain, always make it stop, okay? Because you, you  don't know what server is going to contact your service. from a security point of view. That's not a good thing but for the sake of the exam, you",
  "a good thing but for the sake of the exam, you have to do this, okay?  Then allow credentials allows cookies. So keep that true definitely allow get  and post methods. If the question specifically says to use another method Please, make sure don't just  blindly copy-paste code and think Why is it not working? Okay. So that's why I'm explaining this to you Get and post methods are  the most common ones. I am 19, I should say, 95%. Sure I'll give 5% chance That will only be either get a post,",
  "5% chance That will only be either get a post, okay? most likely you get to but who knows, maybe they may be post but allow methods get and post and allow headers allow all kinds of headers. Okay. So that's for  your course. Next thing is.  Creating an Endpoint, Right? You have a decorator at app at app dot get, which is a get request because that's what you send in the URL, right? And this is for the home directory. So what I've done here is okay, I've already got this running.  You do. So,",
  "okay, I've already got this running.  You do. So, you just do UV run and this is a demo server. I've got running right. So just do UV, Run Demo Server Dot PI.  Gets it up and running.  If you look at here, this the URL for it, and if I go here,  Right? So you can see Right.  So it says, Yeah, so this this is a responsive code. So the server is working, right tools and data, science is for grown-ups. Okay, so Right.  So that's at the home directory. So that's how you create an endpoint endpoint.",
  "So that's how you create an endpoint endpoint. That's a simple as that, but remember, responses can come in three  ways, right? So that's why I've got this next bit here. So you got plain text response, JSON, response or HTML, this one. Those are three main types. I don't know.  Any others, maybe you can educate me about it but for the purpose of exam that's fairly sufficient, if there's something else ask Gbt Okay, so  here's another response, right? So this endpoint is called J. Echo for",
  "right? So this endpoint is called J. Echo for JSON, Echo, I'm going to send it a query, right? A parameter. And it's going to send me back exactly what I sent it. So we know that it's  working, right? So look at the construction. It's this is the endpoint, it's going to work on, right? This one worked on the home endpoint. This one will  work on the slash Jayco J Echo endpoint.  Here is the query parameter, Can someone tell me? What is the, what is the name of the parameter that I'm sending in?",
  "is the name of the parameter that I'm sending in? >> Ritwik Trivedi: Parameter, we query.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes, on this for this endpoint. So if I, if I just write it here, right? So  imagine I'm typing http, colons flashlight, you know, local host. 8,000, great. Wonderful. So now, What do I do?  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Suggest Core. And the Corey equals to we have  >> Carlton D'Silva: So, it's rash Jayco and then what?  >> Ritwik Trivedi: Um, Jim work. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: What's?  >> AMAN",
  "Jim work. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: What's?  >> AMAN DHOL: Question Mark.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah.  >> 24F2003130 SHAMBHAVI VERMA: Like, and create.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, okay. So that's, that's exactly right. So if I go here, right? And do. Jay Echo. Which mark? very,  Equal to, and let's see who's here in this session. So, Sivans has raised a hand, I'll put Sivans' name there. Run. Okay, so we got the response back from the server, right?  so it's a comeback and if you look at the inspect",
  "so it's a comeback and if you look at the inspect tools, again, useful to know how to do this. So that's why I'm showing you if you go to the Network tab, right? So right now you can't see anything because it is already done the  Request, but we can reload it, right? So, if I just reload the page, you can reload it from the tools itself. You don't have to go to the page to reload, so you can just right click and say, right? And you can see. So there's the query and this is the important thing.",
  "the query and this is the important thing. You can see what the request comes out. Like, right? So in case you're in your rohit's answer. Saying wrong wrong and you're saying No no, it's right right, right? You can look at the response. This is the response that's coming back. There's a keyword and it's a JSON response. There's a keyword and sivans and you can switch this button to raw. And in raw, you can see there's even these braces and all that  stuff, right? So this is exactly the raw",
  "that  stuff, right? So this is exactly the raw output that is coming back to the ROI exam. So right, that's how you examine and look at it. Okay, Sivans. So you had a question, Sivans, you had your hands Hello. Oh, yes, Sivans. >> SIVANS: Yes, sir. I already got it answered. I was only thinking that can I get some  >> Carlton D'Silva: Oh, okay. >> SIVANS: project type of question also, but you told that you  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah. >> SIVANS: will probably need to understand the data.  >>",
  "will probably need to understand the data.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes.  Okay. Now something else very important I want to say right? If there's a deployment question How long do you need to keep the server and can someone answer that question?  So the server is running now, right? You can see it here, it's taking requests and >> SIVANS: One minute, one. One minute.  >> AMAN DHOL: Till your last save, I guess.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, keep your server running till you finish the exam. Okay. Is",

  "Did someone else has the question? Okay.  >> AMAN DHOL: No sir. >> Carlton D'Silva: All right. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Clark.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, good. I, >> TELVIN VARGHESE: So like 45 minutes is the time light. So can we have this could  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes, yes for sure. You can have questions like this but what I'm what?

  "a few minutes, right? And you can see why.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, that that's fine. Running cold is fine, but like system. response time is very  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay. Open. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: bad in my system even while doing creating also. So it took me like more than I'm one or two hours to just process everything downloading everything. So  Singing, if you like this custom ones, then it is difficult for me.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, maybe maybe borrow a friend's laptop for the",
  "maybe maybe borrow a friend's laptop for the day.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: No one will be. We can say  >> Carlton D'Silva: Look.  Yeah, I don't know quite how to help you there but I can do my best showing you what you can expect. Okay. So that's  >> RAGHU VASANTH RAO: Sir, do you camera for ROI? That is a  >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no ro is not ro is not proctored, so no parametera. Okay.  You can use anyone's help. You can have a whole team of friends there. You can get Elon musk to help you, it",
  "there. You can get Elon musk to help you, it doesn't matter, okay?  >> AMAN DHOL: Browser.  >> Carlton D'Silva: But the main thing is it, you have to have speed, and you have to get the answers quickly.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: NPs help.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Can da help. >> Carlton D'Silva: No, no. Then what's the point? We might as well. Write the example you right.  Here, the one who has to write the exam, right? So you have to learn how to collaborate, how to make",
  "you have to learn how to collaborate, how to make friends, and how to become. we have our own team here, right? So you guys TAS will be doing helping with tech support and running the exam itself so, so they will not be able to help, okay? Right.  So, that's okay. So this is JSON Echo, right? So remember here, the response is important. I put J is JSON response and I put content equal to data. So that's how I'm saying making sure that the response that's going out is hundred percent, certainly",
  "that's going out is hundred percent, certainly a JSON data. Okay. So that's so next is something called vehicle. So Paco is plain text response. So remember in this  In this response class, right? I have written here. What I'm sending back. So there are two ways to do it either. I can. So that's I have shown you both is So here, I've just put the endpoint. And in the return I've said, JSON response. Here. What I've done is, I have told beforehand, the response class is going to be plain text.",
  "the response class is going to be plain text. So expect, plain tech, whatever comes out of this, send it to  whoever is requesting it as plain text. So we will try this P, okay? so, I go here.  >> Ritwik Trivedi: Vibration front. Please also do PR to this common file. We are building. If you are not  >> Carlton D'Silva: okay, so vehicle What shall we put here someone else? Someone else's someone else's name. Let's  see. So Kumar right. You Umar, I've never seen a spell that way. So Kumar, we're",
  "I've never seen a spell that way. So Kumar, we're going to we're going to send, get a plain text responsive you. Yeah. Okay. Kumar sofa.  No response from Kumar but response from my server, okay. So, I have received a parameter called Query and has so okay, so it sent something back. But how do we know this is? Plain text, right? so,  There's the P Echo. And look at this, it's completely plain text but you may notice it's on two lines. Well, that's because I've specified that. I want it  onto",
  "because I've specified that. I want it  onto lens. Yeah. Put a slash in here, right? But I've sent it. data and it is sent it in completely plain text. so that's how you get plain text Responsor Very important. Okay? So that's why I'm showing you these things. Okay, this is something that many people's many students stumbled upon during one of the GIs, I think. One of the parameters. Okay, so, can someone tell me what the query parameter name is over here in this for this endpoint? Slash 3.  >>",
  "over here in this for this endpoint? Slash 3.  >> Manmeet Kaur: Class.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Correct, it's class, right? But many students had this problem. They gpt gave them wrong code. That's the first thing. Okay gpd in no it was wrong. So it got code like this, they ran the code and it's giving errors. They send  the code back to GPT. Still doesn't know what's wrong, because DP thinks it's right and it's still giving us, right? So class is a resort keyboard in Python you can't use the Word",
  "resort keyboard in Python you can't use the Word class. So that's why, unlike here, where I use the word query,  Classes result keyword, so you have to give it some other name. But the problem is if you give it some other name then how does it know  that? Actually the query parameter is class. So for that the workaround for that is you say string. So here it's normally a string but you add this extra bit you say equal to and use this query function. The query function comes from  Fast API.",
  "The query function comes from  Fast API. Okay. So use this query function.  Okay, and then these three dots means this is a required parameter, okay? So if it's a required parameter, then you can't just send this endpoint. You must put a query parameter. So that's what those three dots are.  And then I said, Alias equal to class. So now it knows that the alias is going to come in the query as this word class and it could be any keyword, okay? It could be deaf, async whatever you want to call",
  "It could be deaf, async whatever you want to call it, right? You cannot put those here because they're all reserved keywords, so this is to show you. How do you get around the tricky? Problem of using reserved keywords as query parameters.  right? So, that's why I'm showing you this. So alias is class and then we can see what the responses, right? So you can see the response. So that so, Keep.  Keep and you can see class equal to, and I'll say, tedious. So there we go. We got got it working,",
  "tedious. So there we go. We got got it working, right? You can see so this many students,  Fail to do this and didn't understand it. So, even in the discourse when you were trying to guide them towards this answer, they still didn't understand what was happening. So that's why I wanted to show you this. Okay. so those things, okay, someone started out is Akbar. Yes.  >> AKBAR ALI: Down into basic things. Can you please tell me that? There is no criteria or there is a particular  range of things",
  "or there is a particular  range of things from where the RV is made, that is only the Till Ga5 assignment, right?  >> Carlton D'Silva: So yeah, it's weak. Sorry. Modules, one through five. Yeah, that's the range.  >> AKBAR ALI: Okay.  >> Carlton D'Silva: but having said that because you have access to Llms, you know, The technologies that see the you I showed you a word document earlier, right? That Word document had all the things that are going to be covered in our right. So that's the range",
  "to be covered in our right. So that's the range of things. >> AKBAR ALI: oh,  >> Carlton D'Silva: that doesn't mean all those things will come. >> AKBAR ALI: Someone wanted that.  >> Carlton D'Silva: But if you just do those things that I showed you in that Word, document more than likely, you'll be able to get full marks, okay?  >> AKBAR ALI: okay, so one more thing is that  >> Carlton D'Silva: So that's the yeah.  >> AKBAR ALI: server will look like exactly like GS assignments.  >> Carlton",
  "like exactly like GS assignments.  >> Carlton D'Silva: I don't know the answer to that yet.  It most likely will that I'm almost I would say. 95% sure it'll most likely look like the GS assignments.  So it's unlikely, you might have mcqs or msqs most likely you'll have to enter the answers.  Alias deaf. Yeah, sure why not. We can use. We can try it out. I haven't tried it but  >> AKBAR ALI: oh,  >> Carlton D'Silva: Go back here. Okay, so one thing, one very useful thing I'm going to show here.",
  "one very useful thing I'm going to show here. So I've just changed the keyword right but I haven't saved the fight but the server is still running, right? But if you look down here at the bottom, This is something useful to have, okay? When you are running UV corn, right?  have reload equal to True because what that will do is it will just reload the server whenever there's any changes, right? That are not causing it to crash out. If I say control S', the server restarted. So I'm not wasted any",
  "S', the server restarted. So I'm not wasted any time I  made changes to the code and it's working right? So let's see. Change this to death for  someone asked, Is it going to work? I use Death So I don't know the answer. We'll see. Who was it? That us. What's your name?  >> 23F3004407 RATANPRIYA SINGH: From priyada.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Priya.  So deaf work, right? So that's how how you get around that problem of keywords being in the parameter, right? You use this method to get around that",
  "right? You use this method to get around that problem. Notice, I didn't change this because this is just a variable, right? But I change the alias over here so that's how you deal. Okay, one. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Curtain on doubt.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, sure. Yeah. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: This class and the score. We are going, right? Why not? We give it a reads.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Sorry. Yeah, you can it can be anything. I just did it to >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: show",

If you give the courage  >> Carlton D'Silva: Of course. Yeah, it can be anything you want. It can be query, it can be but I because there can be several parameters, also, right? So you can have more than one parameter, so, So it all works. As long as it's not a result keyword. That's the whole point of this",
  "a result keyword. That's the whole point of this showing you this endpoint. Okay. next thing is, you may want >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Hello.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yes, sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Yeah, one more query here. So  if I The Paramount here, will it work or whether I need to go with the alias? Always  >> Carlton D'Silva: On the alias is what matters.

It's not hard to find, you can ask GPT to explain how to use, query function from positive, Okay? But I wanted to at least show you this aspect of it.  okay, because",

  "Question or you because yeah, what your hand is. Okay. All right, so the next part. So these are the simple things, plain text. and JSON response. You may need to send back some little more complicated things. So I'll just so just made a small small, very simple demo that, right?  So, okay, something else I wanted to talk about while we are here, I told you about Excel and Google sheets, right? One of the very common things that businesses and companies always require with regards to data in",
  "companies always require with regards to data in terms of transformation is  Pivot tables, right. Learn how to pivot tables, because pivoting, or slicing data to produce information is extremely valuable it is in fact used all the time everywhere by every business of every  shape or size, small business medium, business, kirana store, one person, business. All of them use pivot tables. If they want to get any meaningful  information to do, you're saying What how can a single person vegetable",
  "saying What how can a single person vegetable vendor require a pivot table? They may not explicitly, use a pivot table, but, you know, when  Give their accounts to an accountant to file for their taxes, right? Guess what. It's a pivot. It's a pivot of their sales. It's a pivot of their the time frame in which they did those sales. It's a pivot even though they don't call it a  pivot. So pivoting is vital right if you don't understand pivoting, learn it. That's what I'm going to say. So this",
  "learn it. That's what I'm going to say. So this next demo is just to show a simple pivot, okay? So and a more complex response,  So here the response is HTML response, so I'm using pandas. Now I'm reading this file. It's a fairly big file. It's got  hundreds or maybe thousands of lines of sales and things of that. So here I'm doing a pivot, right? So this is an example of a period. This is a pivot in two dimensions. Oh, the thing I'm  looking at is the sales column, right? That's what's going",
  "is the sales column, right? That's what's going to give the values in the table, pivot table. The rose as it's called index in pandas, is the regions. So there are various  regions in this table, so I can show you the table real quick, so you can get a sense of it, right? So, here's the table. So there are various things in here, right? So you can see,  all sorts of information. So there are regions west, south central, so different regions for  this large franchise, and they sell all kinds of",
  "this large franchise, and they sell all kinds of things, different prices. and different categories of things. So you can see that not only does it. What the sales were, but also the category of things.  So a nice pivot might be Hey can I get the region breakdown and the category  breakdown by region for the sales of this. Franchise.  That's a pretty interesting pivot, right? A dual pivot as it. So so that's what it. So, the index or the rows are regions, and you can imagine the columns, are",
  "are regions, and you can imagine the columns, are the categories of things that you want to find the sales of, and I've used the aggregation function of some, so maybe it might be. For example, mean or it could be some other kind of function or could be a complex function. I don't know that will be specified in the role. But here, I'm doing a sum, right? I want to find out the sales and regions break down and fill any missing values with  zero.  so that sensible in sales and then I wanted just",
  "so that sensible in sales and then I wanted just I don't need decimals, I just wanted rounded as normally. And then I want to send it back.  Table so I can see what it looks like, right? I don't want to read some nonsense stuff, right? So I've just sent it back as a table, so here's a little bit of a table code, right? See HTML Head body HTML table and I've converted it using  this. So if you don't know, this pandas has a dot to HTML.  Function. So you can send things as HTML, so that's what I",
  "So you can send things as HTML, so that's what I sent it into this body and I've sent the response back. So let's have a look how it looks. So pivot.  Okay, that so the thousands of rows and we've got a nice complex pivot, right?  Not just a simple simple east, southwest and that's it. Now, I've got a two-dimensional pivot that tells me Central's furniture, Central's office  supplies and that's it East furniture, east of See. Just by doing a complex pivot, you might get an answer in the ROI for",
  "pivot, you might get an answer in the ROI for something specific like South and technology. Right? So quickly, so rapidly. you notice. Something you didn't have to do DF. You know, you've been doing filtering and  things of that sort, right? Where DF dot the South equal to whatever region equal to South and BF Dot.  category, equal to equal to technology and then filtrate then put a dot some at the end. Nothing all I did was a pivot and look how rapidly I got the answer, right? So I noticed",
  "how rapidly I got the answer, right? So I noticed some of you are struggling during walks with these things, right? So I wanted to show you the power of pivots because they can get you answers very rapidly and Okay, two dimensional pivots. So  If you don't know how to do pivots learn it, no excuses. Sunday is ROI be familiar with how to do that, okay? Right.  Then this is, of course, obviously Llms, right? I'm not going to demonstrate this. Basically, you should have your chat completion.",
  "Basically, you should have your chat completion. Snippets ready. Okay. In your code. So this is how you send a request. So basically, when I hit this endpoint, it will send a request. So it's a so that's what it does. And then it gives me the response.  So have these ready for embeddings as well as chat completions. And then finally  the last bit of the code was, Okay, this is the server. If I run this file, then I want you to run the UV console and  something else if you're using reload equal",

Yeah, just yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, but this is how you do it if you've got reload equal to,",

But the exam wants me to be able to What do you call for it? To them? Yes. Yeah.  Okay, so I'm not going to show you how to install Ng Rock and get it set up. Just watch the sessions or watch the videos or find out, but I've got engineer running. It's not difficult. It's very simple to set up, Angie Rock. There's literally two lines of code",
  "Angie Rock. There's literally two lines of code here to give and it sets it up. Okay? There are two parts to it. The installation part, where you get the curl, and you send some  pseudo commands and all copied from Ng Xerox website. And the second part is the token, that's very important. If you many people forget to pull do that. Second bit of the installation, right?  Can has to be loaded into your NG rock Yaml file. So do those two lines of code NG Rock is set up. Now once you enjoy rock is",
  "NG Rock is set up. Now once you enjoy rock is set up, you can just type this command right? And This bit of the command tells where your current service run. So this server of us you can see is running on localhost, which is 0 0, 0 0, 8000. So that's exactly what I'm done here. This is the same endpoint that we're eating, so we're telling Ng Rock on my local computer. This is the endpoint that I'm eating, this is coming, which are hitting from five. Once I do that. All right. Limited to one",
  "five. Once I do that. All right. Limited to one simultaneous.  Oh, have it running already? I think. Oh yes I do. Okay, so that's a common mistake to make, right? We have ng rock running already and we forgot that we had it running. So it is actually already running over here. So I'm going to use this endpoint. so, So if you see this error, that's what it means. You're already running in Xerox on it. So this is the endpoint to copy link.  Let's give it a try. In fact, anybody out there in can't",
  "it a try. In fact, anybody out there in can't write. Now if you wanted to, oops,  It was running earlier, but we'll see. Yeah, it is working great. Let's Let's try some of our other endpoints, We had pivot, right then. There's the pivot. Now, if you don't believe me that this is a running world Wide Web, right? So I'm going to send this to you. And you can try it. And so this way, what? So why is this important? The ROE server needs to be able to access yourself, right? That's why this is so",
  "to access yourself, right? That's why this is so super important. So in this, put it in the chat. Okay. you need to be able to  If there is any deployment based questions. server needs to access your service, right? And so,  being able to send your service to the server, so they can access it.

  "They're saying  they're doing requests to myself. These are not requests that I made not all of these  anymore. Right. Many people are making requests because the server is running. So, what that means is, so I can show you, I'll stop the server now, right? Right. The server has stopped. See when I. So now I'm just in terms right now, if you try to hit the endpoint, it's not going to work. But running the server means running this command UV run and this applet called  Demo Server dot P1 and so",
  "and this applet called  Demo Server dot P1 and so what happens is it runs the HTTP. So so that's  running as a service on the port, 8000 on your local list, that's what means running. So  this what I mean by that and also equally so see. Now many people are trying to so get get requests and they're not coming through because there's a bad  gateway, it's right because it's not connected. But as soon as I get this back running up again, right? Hopefully. we should be able to get  Get requests",
  "Hopefully. we should be able to get  Get requests working without any issue. So can someone try and see? They're able to yes, so someone's run the test. I think it's a quick trying test again and again, right?  Someone's tried Paco. So po with a parameter, right? It's got to be a parameter for it. so,  I can see requests are coming in, right? But these other ones Paco pivot pivot doesn't require a parameter. But now the service running, so there are two things that have to be running. One is",
  "are two things that have to be running. One is the server itself, which is your demo server and the other one is your N0 rock, both of these need to be running. When both of these run. Then you're a that means we are able to access it. So, both are required. Okay, this is clear crystal clear to everyone.  >> AMAN DHOL: Yes.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Okay.  >> SIVANS: And one question, sir. I have one you special analysis. What kind of questions can we get from the geospatial analysis server?  >>",
  "we get from the geospatial analysis server?  >> Carlton D'Silva: so,  the you've seen the mocks, right? So mock 2 is a good one. If you watch the session, the Wednesday session, which personaser did There were some geospatial questions.  You know, knowing how to do those right? We use mock 2 as a reference point for that. so that, you know how to Deal with, for example, regions and graphs. That's why stressed earlier in the session. About those aspects of it, right? And network X.  Okay, so",
  "aspects of it, right? And network X.  Okay, so  Networks right to work with graphs.  another thing is, for example, you could be given a region, okay? So this is an example of A type of question that could you can be given a region, right? And this region  has some coordinates. So on a map you will have like, say four cities.  and in and then the question is could be like Okay I want to deliver pizzas or something  like that, right? So which  Which region does this request belong to something",
  "region does this request belong to something like that, right? So that could be an example. so,  and I would again recommend you brush up on how to do those sorts of things for example, watch mock 2 on Wednesday, okay. Right, that's it from me for now. I've gone 20 minutes over the time limit. I was set for myself. If there's any more doubts can quickly, ask them, and  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Generation that he would a code alone.  >> Carlton D'Silva: The pivot code. Is it okay? >> TELVIN VARGHESE:",
  "The pivot code. Is it okay? >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah.  >> Carlton D'Silva: So okay, notice something else, right? I didn't close this. Yeah, I've got this terminal running because it's running then zero, so just because you got something running, don't close the terminals, right? It may or may not be running, but the best way to know it's running is just keep the terminals open.  Anytime you want to do something new, open a new terminal, right? So if I want to do something new, I just open a",
  "So if I want to do something new, I just open a new terminal and do whatever I want. Is it right? But keep the  server running both servers and g-rock needs to access your system and your server itself has to be running which is on your system. Okay. And whatever else that the Roe asks you  Okay. so, That's, that's an example of a period, right?  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, just full core connection, just minimize that terminal.  >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, I mean, this is this, I mean, this",
  "D'Silva: Yeah, I mean, this is this, I mean, this basically here is the pivot code basically.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Ls4.  >> Carlton D'Silva: This how we make them. Yeah.  And notice I used encoding windows 1252. It wasn't a normal encoding on this pivot table, which is why I had trouble importing.  And I've shown you earlier the code as well for how to deal with encodings to discover the encodings. Right, so I'm done. >> PREMDEEP MAITI: A third.  So, where can I find the document that you have",

Then only will append it to the list, so that later we can cover put it inside the data frame. So for each one of these will get it. Oh, so this is some other business ID. Then this is some other side.  so after that, maybe I will just print L at the very end  Print. And Let's see, what is that?  Okay,",

We don't  Data frame and then I'll and then to CSV. But then I will have to import pandas PD And let's see if this works or not. And what is there in the CSV? Our business ID address city,  And let's try to verify for one of these files. So the first one, In the HTML. Scraping thing is this file bills. 9 2 6 7, 4 2, 9 2, 6 7 2.  9 2, 6 7 2. Okay, this",

And then city is SF and then  postal code is six to six seven four and then latitude is correct. And then longitude is also correct. Phone number is also correct. And then Or X code is also correct.

That's why there are only 40 euros. Now after it's creeping the HTML data. Let's  try to get back to questions.  Is there something we can answer with just HTML? Scraping so,  This is violations dB and then these are the two steps that we need to do. So  here, we don't need HTML. Scraping at all. It is just TV. So this is the",
  "Scraping at all. It is just TV. So this is the easiest question so I would  First do this question before? No. No we want to have HTML. Scripting is here. all right, so for second question also, we need HTML scraping, but along with PDF is creeping as well in third question. Are we only need HTML data?  But okay, let's have a look at what all these calculate, the average and the average of the luxurian values, also all the rows. In each postal code, this is the center, right?  And then",
  "postal code, this is the center, right?  And then calculate the ipadrogen distance, each restaurant and decentroid calculate.

Why are you using this dictionary is than just, you know, kind of getting extracting? Just the even values in in the TVs.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: because,  >> Saransh Saini: because when we are extracting that TVs, the E that even values are actually the data so we can just iterate over them, right? But a reason we are",
  "iterate over them, right? But a reason we are using dictionaries over here. Can you just go back to the code? so,  are using system dictionary, is that you're not data if you just inspect multiple HTML files.  We are going to have generously open the first female performance again the same mistake over here. Yeah, just the first system. Exactly, exactly. Exactly. Okay, so you have changed this one. I just open it on.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: Okay. >> Saransh Saini: Live Server. Just click on",

I just using the Data Office, 31 files, so calculate the average of the latitude and like, you values of all the rows in each postal code,  So, I think we need to group by postal code and then we need to calculate the average.

Just keep it as in data frame. And I want to do.  Part about if you cannot to seriously. one is because  Actually, I want this.

You three or five. like,  And this how calculated for everything else record we have, like, average of latitude and longitude The second level.  After getting the average. We need to get the right thing and distance between each. Of our restaurant, and Centroid.  Al instance, I don't understand. Oh, that is just a clear median distance.  All right, try using",

Are we not during early?  >> Ritwik Trivedi: No, because VS code has lot of extinctions in a vehicle. It over over one or two years, right? So,  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: So yeah, if all those extensions are available in the Other one, then you can just use that.  If it doesn't have",
  "then you can just use that.  If it doesn't have these extensions, which are helpful. Like, for viewing this,  Violations dot db, i require SQLite viewer. If it doesn't have that extension and if there is something you wishful that you require and if that doesn't, that is not that Then you can avoid using it.  Okay. That is it for the session? I think there is nothing much that is you  >> Ritwik Trivedi: We also this common repo which I'm making.  Is some reason, the navigation can be improved",
  "Is some reason, the navigation can be improved or is it okay? Again, try thinking of making a common.  Read me on. Put navigation like this. Basis, whatever is needed. Now, click on signs, just  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: Basically, should we faster to access everything?  >> Ritwik Trivedi: So, in naming the files in such a way like a standalone Python files. I am  notebooks, I will probably do. But notebook is not working properly like with the virtual environment.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT:",
  "virtual environment.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: Okay. Yeah, what you can do is you can create some snippet of code using UV, okay? And just test those snippet of code and then you can stick it inside a notebook. Because those are validated codes.  >> Ritwik Trivedi: Know, all UV snippets along with that UV script tag can be used in the mobile.  >> JIVRAJ SINGH SHEKHAWAT: Yeah, you can put it inside the notebook, I don't know if you will be able to run it from the notebook but what you can do,",
  "to run it from the notebook but what you can do, whatever thing you require, you can copy it from that particular cell.  So it will keep things organized and you can. and those are the tested codes because you have tested them using you.  All right, goodness, guys. And I will end this session now.  >> Saransh Saini: Ordered this good night and on the best forever.  >> Ritwik Trivedi: To your good name. Hopefully we at least passenger.  >> Saransh Saini: Yeah.  >> Ritwik Trivedi: I hope so.",

  "e uh Naz let's give some more time for uh everyone to join for I think we can start uh maybe once people join we can further uh increase so I'm starting the streaming okay uh Mana so this this session is basically on queries and any specific uh um discussions that you want to bring up uh we don't have any knowledge this is not a knowledge sharing session at least for this week if uh wedes day sessions are usually for uh query resolution or any questions anything you want to highlight from a",
  "questions anything you want to highlight from a discourse perspective or something you would like to suggest or any it's more of a query discussion uh and keeping the floor open any specific questions you would like to begin with is there anybody having any questions any queries so for project two like in which in which we have to uh basically answer the gred assignment questions is the like uh is is the function calling approach going to be more appropriate uh yeah go ahead like some people",
  "appropriate uh yeah go ahead like some people were saying that if we have basically we either have the answers or if we solve the GS again uh and we basically have a like a key value thing and we we just identify which question they are asking and if the same set of questions are going to be asked right we could just identify that then give response accordingly uh see yeah there is uh let's say problem or uh how we solve specific problems so I would say the most hardest approach would be to",
  "I would say the most hardest approach would be to have functional calls for these 50 questions but let's say um ideally from the submission point we are looking at um how uh you can deploy an llm agent to solve the answer so essentially um uh bringing back so there there is a way yes obviously you can uh uh put it as like uh function calls for 50 questions and then uh uh keep it in a different way uh but we are still uh thinking of other options like what uh different ways there there are other",
  "like what uh different ways there there are other multiple ways uh you can have uh a solution so uh the best approach would be basically llm based Auto coding solution like llm you ask a question to the L LM is able to provide you answer so uh that would be uh one of the best Solutions or approach how you can handle it uh another thing is basically the one which we have like function calls like 50 which is more of a harder effort uh that you'll have to deploy and then come back on it okay sir",
  "have to deploy and then come back on it okay sir so so more like feeding whatever errors or something come back to the llm and then like with the prompt engineering approach that's correct so so we can go creative with how uh we want to solve this problem maybe uh uh we just waiting for uh few more uh like uh questions and approaches which you would want to recommend like let's say uh uh if you have some work on uh or or suggestions like like as you mentioned 50 function calls or uh different",
  "you mentioned 50 function calls or uh different options uh keep the uh discourse Post open we wanted to get your inputs as well on how you wanted to solve this problem and uh maybe in couple of days we will again uh provide some more clarity on what could be a best approach and whether you would like to proceed with that kind of scenario so right now think this as more like a problem that state M which you have and there are multiple ways to solve this problem and that's what we exactly tell",
  "this problem and that's what we exactly tell across the different segments in tools and data s to solve a problem understand a problem and uh develop the logic and then finally deploy the solution and that can there is no one single way as a right way there are multiple ways by which we can do [Music] it yeah and I see PR deep uh raising the hand yes PR deep sir uh I have a question regarding uh project two yes so um we have to create uh an endpoint that accept a post request uh for a question",
  "that accept a post request uh for a question and there can be a file attach attachment so unlike uh project one uh where we have uh where uh uh AI uh API key for openi is also Prov Ed but in Project two uh there will be only question and optional attachment so what if uh uh I use uh we have to use the uh API token given uh given by the I and what if the $2 uh limit is crossed and during testing it failed so um how to tackle this okay this is with respect to tokenization and uh the credit limit",
  "respect to tokenization and uh the credit limit which we have with the current uh keys right that's a valid question we will uh uh check back with the team I think uh right now it's it should be $2 per uh month on the query but yeah I understand the situation here so uh give us a a day we'll we should be able to give you feedback on disc course regarding that uh scenario because if if uh if in the uh post request uh uh during testing they also send the API key so uh then there will be no",
  "also send the API key so uh then there will be no problem mhm no no uh you mean uh you're asking that as a question or trying to no I am uh I am uh saying that uh in Project two due during testing our uh API token will be used so if $2 is crossed so during test uh testing evaluation uh the uh the results can fail I'm seeing this uh yeah we get that point uh we'll uh uh that shouldn't be a challenge but anyways we'll confirm that uh uh over disc scores in a day uh regarding the AP calls uh the",
  "scores in a day uh regarding the AP calls uh the that needs to go okay M and uh another thing to ask uh regarding project one yes uh that uh ta has said that the solution for project one is uh uh uh by the uh Anan sir is almost uh 150 lines code and he said that he will uh show us the solution code and how it works so uh when will it happen uh yeah it should happen sometime in a week or so uh we are just waiting for uh an's uh timeline like his availability and schedule a call we should have",
  "availability and schedule a call we should have that call Sooner okay you'll it will be notified well in advance on uh both the mail notification as well as in discour and in all channels okay okay any other questions [Music] uh any other specific questions any any comments on the Roe how did you feel about the Roe my computer hanged so I do not know what to say um computer hang Rik did did you join the call that uh other day like the last minute you are unable to send the right I like I",
  "minute you are unable to send the right I like I panicked yeah you had you had an issue with ISP right pardon you had an issue with your internet service provider no no my computer hang I was like uh working for like 20 24 hours continuously my computer had lot of tabs open everything and it hanged uh but you made your submissions right no sir I was not able to because everything was very slow but then I fixed it later but then obviously later we cannot I'll probably repeat TDS if if necessary",
  "cannot I'll probably repeat TDS if if necessary yeah that is like a operational challenge like we recommend everyone to have uh uh submitted at regular intervals like have your submission submitted in regular even if you finish a couple of questions have like uh uh submissions and intermediate interval so that we will have your submissions we even had few submissions where uh they had uh higher marks and then while testing out or some other technical issue they uh um they were unable to fill in",
  "issue they uh um they were unable to fill in their marks but we we have a track of all the submissions successful submissions and we have their Max marks like what they have scored so that way uh as long as if you have submitted whatever you have worked out in that 45 minutes that should be available and I think okay this is unfortunate we couldn't help you on that part and we had that Google meet uh uh call where we were able to address each and every issue as early as possible and I mean the",
  "every issue as early as possible and I mean the entire crew was uh available in that g me call to address any specific technical issues anything from a portal perspective or from uh system perspective but uh yeah with respect to uh maybe you should it's I mean uh as a general note the best recommendation is if you have something critical try to always restart your system keep your system uh uh in a boot mode so that uh it is fresh and uh not exhausted so that it don't doesn't H at critical the",
  "so that it don't doesn't H at critical the main problem was that I was exhausted so I did not take care of the basic sanitary things like cleaning up cach in the computer setting up things properly understood so that is why I hang in in some way and then your computer hang then I panicked mean it's all learning there are lots to learn as you go in in real world scenario we'll have lots and lots of scenarios such that you'll work in an specific Excel file with all these formulas put in uh but",
  "Excel file with all these formulas put in uh but essentially save it as CSV and then you will lose all one one thing I I just say that the tools I've learned like in terms of data rangler and everything they are so useful that I'm being able to at least in in the actual work which I do I'm being able to do things in 5 to 10 minutes which would otherwise take four to 5 hours because in terms of processing error locks and everything it is very helpful good to hear that yeah I see rishit uh",
  "helpful good to hear that yeah I see rishit uh raising up the hand yes RIT yes uh I want to ask I I just want to ask that in the first question it was some H HTTP link and it worked for the first time but I closed the tab on the Google so the next time I clicked on check it doesn't consider that and it eventually went wrong so there's something I can do about that because I posted the link and saved it but the correct is not there it's actually invalid uh no so if I understand it right so this",
  "invalid uh no so if I understand it right so this is with respect to Roe right Roe question number one yeah correct Roe question number one yeah okay so you had uh submitted an answer and it was correct and eventually when uh you changed or re uh no no just I closed the tab where I have to open the link for the successful HTTP link and then I just closed that and went to other questions just for checking just for the sake of checking and it just get lost okay you mean were you able to",
  "it just get lost okay you mean were you able to successfully submit the answer no yeah yeah I just saved the answer along with the lyric I think as long as you have saved the submitted the answer that will be taken care of yeah works works works yeah yeah yeah yeah so we have all the submissions which have individual student has entered so that shouldn't be a challenge at from our end yeah sh thank you so much yeah as long as you have submitted that that's the reason why we keep on um uh",
  "that that's the reason why we keep on um uh exaggerating even telling you make sure that you always submit your answers even if you finish one or two questions so that you have the submissions ready from this kind of a client uh server uh setup always it's better to have your uh Footprints put in the server yes uh so I've saved it so I'll consider in case of any issue I'll write it in the discrepancy form exactly L yes you can write in description we'll have all the records from your",
  "description we'll have all the records from your submissions and then we can have a cross discussion on that yeah absolutely thank you so much okay um and before uh that I see one isan uh in Project two do we need the result to be exact answers of GS or can there be a different file that may be used while evaluation data scaping questions in Gs have specific files attach to them um maybe isan can you explain this I I don't think I get it completely [Music] oh if I understand okay okay so if",
  "[Music] oh if I understand okay okay so if your question is about uh whether so all the G have been randomized so now the question is if whether whatever answers you got is exactly how you wanted the uh uh sir I think he wants to say that for example in a question we have to do some computation on a file name ABC so I think he saying that the file name will be same or the file name will be different that XY z uh no as long as it is mentioned as ABC you will have that specific format to be used",
  "ABC you will have that specific format to be used so consider this as let's say you have uh um uh unique uh uh file uh names or unique records in two different files so in that case you'll have two different files to be used and then obviously you'll have these file names will be fixed I mean when I say file names those file names can go as always as parameters so we can ask llm for the file names and we can put that in the arguments of the function ideally yes yes those can be parameterized",
  "ideally yes yes those can be parameterized exactly all so whenever you find something which is more of an object uh so there are logic and objects that go into logic so as long as uh the logic is accurate the objects can pass on as parameters and then it can run through the logic so the logic should be sound here that's the IDE yeah I hope I answered that isan if you have further questions you can still message yes Prim sir uh what will be the agenda of today's session no today's session is",
  "agenda of today's session no today's session is query session we it's yeah it's more like trying to understand what uh um any is there any queries that you want get to get addressed is there anything which you want to discuss about um if it's a knowledge session we'll mention it earlier uh what is going to get covered here this is more like a query session yeah yeah any other uh queries questions see ideally there are couple of things which we are uh still working on uh with respect to when I",
  "are uh still working on uh with respect to when I say project to that as I mentioned there are multiple creative ways how we can uh uh resolve this and uh I believe we will uh also notify the idea here is uh definitely uh the key goal here is to get exposed to solving any kind of problem that comes in future as well as to learn and uh how to code in collaboration so basically we uh you can even think about how you want to collaborate and then work around there are different approaches which we",
  "around there are different approaches which we can uh handle sir uh another thing to ask um I remember some questions have uh images in them where we have to do some computation on the images correct some manipulations so uh will the images will be uh provided as attachments in the post request or as a base 64 encoded format so I think in our uh segments most of them were embed as either URL or Json I mean jpa objects so uh you can Define that uh in the specific way that is available like uh I",
  "in the specific way that is available like uh I think I believe it was in jpeg right the specific image file as a as an object within the Json or the portal no I am not asking about the image format like it is MH jpeg or PNG I am asking that if it will be in the post request it will be as an attachment as the second argument is for attachment files as an attachment or in the question itself it will be given as a base 64 encoding the image uh I don't get that clearly so can you tell me which",
  "I don't get that clearly so can you tell me which question you are uh asking about uh maybe I can is it GA yes it is GA I think it is um G uh 2 or G3 uh where we have to do some computations I think we have to compress the image there is a image given we have to save the image and do some com uh compression on the image and then encode the image in the base 64 and thenode we have to up image correct you have to upload the compressed image right uh as in Bas 64 encoding yeah I think uh yeah so",
  "uh as in Bas 64 encoding yeah I think uh yeah so um what is the challenge you think you'll have I me whether that's goes as a post request as a file or as a web URL that's is that uh the question no I am asking that uh in the post request there are uh two parameters uh one is question that will be uh required and another is optional that will be a file attachment so let's say the question is uh uh from the G like compress this image or do some manipulation and the image data will be Pro can be",
  "and the image data will be Pro can be provided in the question itself and as base 64 encoding or secondly it can be provided as the uh second argument in the post request that is as an uh file attachment uh usually file works as a general approach generally file Works uh and usual format is binary I mean the uh binary file uh type within the uh uh specific uh parameter but uh uh the uh can you again repeat the first option where along with the post request you're sending up uh the image as a",
  "post request you're sending up uh the image as a base encoded B 64 encoded F format yes uh the image is encoded as base 64 string and it is given in the question itself so no attachment has uh has to be uh sent in a post request okay um okay so fine I think uh maybe uh I'll just put this as a part of discussion uh thread uh we'll get back to you on that uh maybe this gives rings a bell on evaluation script as well so we will uh let you know on uh checking out with the evaluation script okay",
  "uh checking out with the evaluation script okay yeah yeah any other questions uh okay so I see couple of things um in some questions some images are answers do we have to return these IM okay I think this is what we discussed Now work on questions only which returns no uh okay uh we have to work on every all type of questions not just IM string type questions it's both string and images and I think now we discussed about how we can have different ways of sharing the image with the post yeah and",
  "ways of sharing the image with the post yeah and uh going back to the next question uh sorry uh I mean uh going back uh so there is no uh restriction with the type of answer uh the llm application should be able to sufficiently handle all the set of different types of questions and uh I see one more chat sya uh project 2 has already been released and uh uh it's released two days back and we have a deadline of 31st March if I'm not wrong one second yeah 31st March will end of day IST will be the",
  "yeah 31st March will end of day IST will be the project du uh yes Prim so uh there are some questions for example in G there is a question Rel related to GitHub and there is also a question related to GitHub in I think in deployment module uh in in all these question we have to uh create a git uh Depot and then we have to um we have to uh in a deployment we have to create some uh G GitHub actions and so these things how to uh how can we do these things because we have to because I think we have",
  "things because we have to because I think we have to do this uh manually like creating the uh GitHub repo in the GitHub and then creating GitHub actions okay so um you would have worked with Git commands right yes and you would also worked with uh bash commands where you can make a directory establish git pull establish G uh uh repo build so uh not so essentially it doesn't mean that you would always need everything to be done manually there are multiple options of command line inters where you",
  "multiple options of command line inters where you can able to run almost all commands of git within a command yes I can do get in it and but these things will be in the local git so for GitHub I know they provide a command line interface MH MH get have provider command line interface but uh uh using that uh the GitHub Depot can be created but creating GitHub action uh using that can be challenging I don't know it why just create that git thing that that folder you have to create but we have",
  "that that folder you have to create but we have also to create a GitHub repo that will be local okay we have to create a GitHub repo uh most probably a public GitHub depo and uh in the questions I know we have to also then give the raw raw GI URL file [Music] URL let me take one moment quickly just one minute I would recommend you to also check with uh CLI GitHub uh manual there are ways to create both uh GitHub repos in um remote and as well as in local so I'm just sharing the uh details in",
  "as in local so I'm just sharing the uh details in the chat window so CA github.com and uh both in terms of different ways by which you would like to create uh okay I'm checking that so there are different ways GH uh report uh create there are multiple ways by which you can still create a public repo and initialize them check this manual that should give you sufficient details on how you can handle entire operations of G within a command line MH okay any other uh queries so for this GitHub thing",
  "any other uh queries so for this GitHub thing we'll have to like if the llm has to do it automatically do we have like give our2 to it or can always have uh user uh authentication so the command line has GH GH repo create there are different uh uh command line options using which you can essentially control whatever you're U work working on with the GUI interface so uh if it's an llm again what I what I currently say is something which comes immediately out of my main but there are different",
  "out of my main but there are different ways to handle it one item would be like have a a login as environment variables and pass it on to the llm so that it can create under your username and account and it holds as a repos within your account okay thank you sir y okay any other questions sir uh in in ga1 uh there is a question uh where we have to use Dev tools uh in the question uh the question is uh uh hidden uh there are some elements hidden in the question and we have to use Dev tools to",
  "in the question and we have to use Dev tools to find those elements so how the questions how this question will be passed through the post request because uh the question will be in the text in plain text format in the post request so how will be turn uh see is it uh so so which you're mentioning is when you said ga1 uh Dev tools question six use Dev tools one second [Music] just okay question number uh six use Dev [Music] tools okay um so this is uh just repeating the question so here you okay",
  "uh just repeating the question so here you okay here you're using browser Dev tools right [Music] okay I still remember there are again different CLA tools here uh I want to uh know that how the questions will be passed because uh in here it is uh using JavaScript to hide the uh question but in the post request uh how the question will be passed actually uh that's a good question and uh let me yeah let me come back on this I'll just uh take couple of minutes to see that on [Music] second so",
  "of minutes to see that on [Music] second so this question I'll come back to this again uh within uh 10 minutes just trying to figure out uh uh the CLI options for uh the specific Dev tool Chrome Dev tools I'll come back on this uh meanwhile uh you see that isan in GFI there is a task which can only be done by exal softw like open refin can I explain how you can incorporate these uh modifications see uh from uh uh uh tooling perspective uh open refine if you think open refine entire open refine",
  "if you think open refine entire open refine is again programmatically handled uh um the most uh effective operation would be entity resolution by um uh clustering algorithms so if uh I'll just repeat that again so there are uh essentially any kind of data cleaning process which happen in open refin is definitely possible with python and on top of that some of the clustering algorithms which they use with respect to uh connecting similar words everything comes under the same coine similarity and",
  "comes under the same coine similarity and uh the basic logic and math is universal so uh question similarity gives like unified words in a different way whereas uh clustering algorithm will try to Cluster and uh put all the uh different uh uh vectors into uh single cluster and then try to uh modify that to us uh the centroid of the cluster which is the ideal value uh there are multiple libraries in Python which you can use there is pacy there is nltk and yeah nltk and uh there are additionally",
  "nltk and yeah nltk and uh there are additionally um uh entity resolution uh is again a predominant topic especially in finance industry where uh uh they use similar techniques to identify multiple shell accounts which have slightly varying names like limited LTD uh so entity resolution is the key and if entity resolution is a challenge there are n number of libraries in Python that can handle it the same way like how open Define is doing and with Excel tasks as a I mean uh in the Roe live",
  "with Excel tasks as a I mean uh in the Roe live sessions we are explaining on how uh anything that can be done in Excel is definitely possible in Python there is no single option that is available only in Excel and that cannot be done in Python uh sir but uh in for example in G1 there are two questions it is written explicitly that for uh for example for Google Sheets question uh this has to be only done in Google sheet and for Excel question that it has to be only done in Excel or else it will",
  "it has to be only done in Excel or else it will give it uh different answers okay uh one second so can you mention that question again [Music] uh can you share that uh specific question I have to share the screen no no just the question number and the g okay okay the uh question number is five G1 okay one second give me a minute okay this is question number 5 ga1 okay so question number five is oh okay uh so uh you have a question here some take s by um uh understood so if you take this",
  "take s by um uh understood so if you take this specific uh scenario here uh I mean uh understood I think I think uh this is clear so anything with respect to Excel or spreadsheet uh tools which is basically Google Sheets or Excel uh there is a clear mention that you have to work only with 365 okay I think this uh requires certain detail please raise this as one of the posts in disc course okay we'll we we'll how we can hand programmatically yeah okay sir uh regarding the GitHub CLI that I have",
  "okay sir uh regarding the GitHub CLI that I have I had asked so so basically it it is also written in the uh project two post that is given by the an that uh we have to use uh versal versal for the API so uh I don't think we can do uh like uh uh using the GitHub CLI like this in versal m we have to use some uh VPS from I think digital Ocean or somewhere because I uh I don't think a versal will allow these things like it will be also there are so many things that can be heavy on the versal",
  "so many things that can be heavy on the versal server and they may not allow this like for example we have to run a llm in some questions and we have to also use NG Rock for some uh public URL I don't think we can do this in the versal [Music] okay I think that's a fa point I understand so uh get up CLA actions will not be directly uh controlled by veral deployments understood okay I think I'll again uh please raise these uh items in the discourse uh uh link this is a fire question we wanted",
  "uh uh link this is a fire question we wanted also to uh R back on uh specifics how to handle these scenarios so whatever we have raised so far is uh fa questions and we just want to understand how uh or we'll get back to you on this how the specific uh approach methodology for this scenario so scenarios like where you use a manual intervention of tools using GitHub Excel or uh with respect to the browser tools I think browser tools again it's JavaScript so you can still have like a document",
  "JavaScript so you can still have like a document document query but nevertheless my suggestion is please add it to a discourse post we'll get back to you on how uh the evaluation script is being buil okay yeah [Music] right any other questions yeah if no more questions I think we can wind up the session and uh uh please put all your questions with respect to the project to in the uh uh discussion query I think yeah there is one fromation while evaluation the evaluator will post a request for a",
  "the evaluator will post a request for a specific question from any of the G hypothetically he picks a question from SQL from of SQL from GA the ga question has some specific parameters and a specific F so do we need to write the script according to the question of the ga such as the question picks up the specific answer of the G or do we need to make it flexible for the evaluator to change obviously it should be flexible for changing the parameters and the fil so uh to be clear uh uh the ga",
  "and the fil so uh to be clear uh uh the ga itself is randomized so uh not everyone gets the same set of parameters and same set of uh files so that has to be parameterized absolutely so that uh the question logic will remain let's say something like what we see in Ro or going back to ga uh let's say there is two files and you have to find out uh uh common or unique rows between two files uh or common rows between two files in these scenarios your logic is basically a single logic that considers",
  "logic is basically a single logic that considers all the rows and finds out which is common uh whereas the files can be parameters so that it can be uh random according to the evaluator okay so going back uh please raise all the specific questions with respect to project 2 in discourse thread and uh uh I'll we'll follow up on uh the very specific questions which you asked on how to handle external tools with an llm agent which we are going to build uh something like GitHub Excel Google Sheets",
  "uh something like GitHub Excel Google Sheets and developer tools okay if there are no more questions I'll wind up the session [Music]",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/mJM-IfeLq1Q =====",
  "so also have to transcribe do we also have to stream them uh okay I have started transcribing and uh recording as well okay fine yeah so pleas ask question so my first question is there are many questions like in G1 there is question 13 and in G2 there is question 7 where we have to uh create GitHub Depot and then create GitHub actions and retrieve the raw GitHub file URL so this requires us uh having GitHub CLI which is GH so uh we have to install it but uh versal uh does not allow us Pudo",
  "it but uh versal uh does not allow us Pudo access to install these packages that are many questions like we have to run local llm uh local Alama file vers will not allow to do that allow us to do that in g 2 question 8 we have Docker related questions we have required to install Docker to push the images to Docker Hub and then in GA question uh GA 2 question 6 we have to deploy a python API to vers instance now versel will also not allow this I uh we cannot create a ver uh python deploy a",
  "I uh we cannot create a ver uh python deploy a python to veral from a versal instance and there are many questions that require us to write and run fast API servers with course enabl uh versal will also not allow to allow us to do that like running multiple fast API servers and many more because versal does not give us pseudo Privileges and there are many restrictions set by versal yeah how can we how can we do that yeah so what I will recommend you at the point actually these doubts are",
  "you at the point actually these doubts are popping up right now and in fact I gu your voice ising there are there is very Eco yeah think is that jaaj and me you both are sitting in the same room and yeah so opening the mic at the same time is not which creates this uh Reverb okay so yeah so I guess premdeep you wrote that post as well on discourse and read that yeah we read that and these concerns are genuine and uh we'll be discussing about these concerns with uh an answer and we clarify them",
  "concerns with uh an answer and we clarify them in the meantime I will recommend you to start working on the questions which are not so which are not creating these kinds of problems and you know just get started with the project so yeah okay and uh uh and what about the questions that requires external toolings like that requires Excel there are questions it is explicitly written that you have to use Excel and it will only work in Office 365 questions require Dev tools and some questions",
  "questions require Dev tools and some questions require Google collapse specific python libraries like google. collab yeah yeah so uh look every question which has been asked for Excel specifically and any question requires you know just a t tools question which requires coab so all these things can be solved Us in python as well so uh you need not do them on Excel because that's obviously that's not what is possible when you're creating an a endpoint so yeah so if you have been given so for",
  "endpoint so yeah so if you have been given so for these questions just use Python you need to go ahead and use other okay uh in uh for the Excel question I I see the question there is the Excel query uh so the Excel query cannot be run in Python uh can use LM llm to get the answer but I tried and it mostly gives a wrong answer can please send me the ga and the that question number uh it is G1 question five G1 question five yes so use Excel okay so this question uh needs to be done in office5",
  "so this question uh needs to be done in office5 but as you can see that this entire function which has been given to you this can also be implemented using pandas as well or basic python libraries yeah I have done that question it's uh can be done by function calling also yeah call just you know either you can use basic python functions the present which just we should be simply able to solve this question but otherwise uh you can use function calling as we just send this entire query to llm",
  "calling as we just send this entire query to llm and it will be okay now uh in GA 1 question six we have to use Dev tools to find the hidden elements but uh yeah how will we do that I mean the in the post request in uh in the post request there will be a question parameter so the question will be passed through it now how will the element will be hidden there in the post request uh look when your yeah yeah yeah so so if there is some question which requires you to uh use console tab or",
  "which requires you to uh use console tab or something like that then in that case you will receive a file on which you would have to apply uh figure figuring out the hidden element and then getting any value out of it okay it will be you will have to apply yeah it will be HTML file okay okay you can simply pass that HTML file to LM and just ask it to find out the moreover in any question where you have been asked to use a data set where you have specifically given a data set to use for that",
  "specifically given a data set to use for that particular question you will be given a data set in the request okay so okay so next question is in a ga 3 question 4 and in GA 3 question five it uses Google collab specific python libraries like Google do collab which cannot be installed locally so how uh we can uh approach this questions in G5 there is ga3 there is no specific requirement of ga3 question 4 and ga3 question 5 yeah so in ga3 question 4 which is base image encoding right yes yeah so",
  "4 which is base image encoding right yes yeah so that doesn't require that got nothing to do with there is a there is a I I'm also opening the question uh there is a code that we have to run and evaluate the answer but we cannot run the code locally because it requires to google. collab Library I remember one such question but it's not from G three uh it might be from some other yeah there was question like that which you mentioning it got something to do with the cab and then I think you would",
  "to do with the cab and then I think you would even have to do give it permissions all right I'm opening the question once a second please just share the screen that would help us what just share the screen and I show us where it has been mentioned go I mean I remember there is one question I I exactly don't remember the question itself but yeah there was one question which require you to use run some code in Google collab let try to figure it out collab no it's not in G1 yeah so I think you are",
  "collab no it's not in G1 yeah so I think you are talking about question number 4 from G2 okay okay I have noted it down and right now I don't know about the solution to it but uh we'll get back to it okay okay and uh the next question is uh there are some questions uh that are not clear that how the post request uh will be sent like what will be the question parameter for example in G yeah yeah I will try to give you some overview about what the expectations of the project is after that if you",
  "expectations of the project is after that if you have question then just let me know okay so hope my screen isible another main thing to ask uh regarding uh the API token so unlike uh project one the project two does not have a API token parameter in the post request hence we have to use the API token provided from uh the TDS team air proxy do. workers. Dev but um which will be also used during evaluation so now what will happen if our uh API token credits and during the evaluation the llm will",
  "credits and during the evaluation the llm will throw errors then so uh what is the say about this so okay uh we we we have ability to increase the uh tokens for individually students so if there is somea cases like that then uh it will be raised but I will discuss it with uh the internal meet in one of the internal meeting okay okay by the way the thing is that these API tokens so your account for that for because API tokens are renewed at every month so so that means that March has started and",
  "month so so that means that March has started and your API tokens must have been reped to again again reset to $2 that means you're not going to run out of those tokens PR not wor wor about about the testing suppose I have uh I have completed the project and I have used uh $19 out of $2 so there is a risk that during evaluation uh the tasks may fail because the all the credits have been used up so this is the question my question yeah yeah so those things will take care of it if there is like",
  "things will take care of it if there is like that happens then uh we have ability to increase uh limits for any API token okay by the way I'm I have read your post which you have created 21 hours ago and I have also read this post so all these questions which we you have just raised right now they are really important questions to address so we'll get back to these questions okay I have kept it in my Google keep okay in the me the internal meeting I will discuss these points okay and another",
  "I will discuss these points okay and another last thing to ask in question in Project one there is uh it is mentioned that the latency for the response is 20 seconds so is there any such uh limitations here so what is the latency time maximum latency time okay uh okay that is something we can add over here sir in the request will you change the question format or will they be asked as it is yeah yeah so that's what I will explain now so each of these questions right like this is uh where is the",
  "questions right like this is uh where is the question uh like for example this is the question right so in this question you will get question in the same wording there won't be any change in wording there won't be different languages so you can identify which question you need to run uh based on the keyword itself so which all are the keywords that are being used here but this this might change this this is parameter wedness day can be some other day Fridays and then these range they might",
  "other day Fridays and then these range they might also change so these are the things that might change and for example for question n let's have a look at what is the question nine so uh like it have so this is also part of question right this um this video and then there is some more code over here but the actual question is this one okay uh so yeah and let me show you some other question which have a long comprehension let's go to G4 so can you give an example for the request made for the",
  "you give an example for the request made for the question which have a specific block like the one you just showed how will they be formatted in the request okay uh yeah uh so for example this is the question right and then it have this this is redundant right we we don't have to do all this so in the request uh you won't receive this one what you will be asked is you will be uh this is the actual which you will be asked on and then this data file it might change uh so if you go to this page",
  "file it might change uh so if you go to this page over here in uh file we are sending few files right so these files will be sent through uh the request itself so this PDF file which is here it will be sent through the request and then this question will be sent and this question will have exact wording see this data can change uh so it might come through some file so it need not to be the same file you don't have to download it and keep it in the folder it can change and it will come through",
  "the folder it can change and it will come through the request itself and then the other thing that might change is uh this question itself so question it won't the wording won't change uh and then like language won't change so it will be exact question only thing is parameters might change for example instead of math it could be English instead of 61 it could be something else and then these parameters can also be changed so you have to identify which all are the parameters so if you are using",
  "which all are the parameters so if you are using a simple word searching so here you can use two approaches One is using function calling uh where you give question and then you have 50 functions let us say there are 10 questions in each GA and five graded assignments so 50 functions so for those you can keep function calling that is one approach and then another approach is you can uh just match with unique identifiers for that question like marks of the student who scored this is this might",
  "of the student who scored this is this might be one of the unique identifier but this parameter it might change so this question you can identify using string searches as well you don't necessarily have to use uh function calling can you open g 2 question two does anyone have yeah sure does anyone have any doubt on how uh the question would come through the request yeah sir I still have a doubt on that yeah uh can you open any G1 or any question which have a specific code block for it like but",
  "which have a specific code block for it like but there is a specific block right a black background block which have some data uh like which one are you talking about um to exact question uh can you open G1 course I remember it has a question like that okay scroll down a bit yeah uh sir in the Google sheet for question number four uh yes uh yes so this will the question in this case so there will be like only one space between equal to sum and the Google sheet right since it's in a separate",
  "the Google sheet right since it's in a separate area equal to some constant one space like this right no yeah I'm uh I'm asking that the question ends uh Google sheet space equal to some is that Google Sheets and then space and then is asking is the code block question is will be separable by something or not yeah so let me answer this the thing is that we are sending post requests right and post in post request you can actually send body with your requests so we will be giving you this entire",
  "requests so we will be giving you this entire text which is present over here and uh it would be able to you know I guess uh multi-line uh is allowed using post request so that won't be a problem for you okay so while giving the question in the question parameter we will be specifying the entire text given to us okay okay the only thing that you have to do is you have to specific if you are going with the keyword approach which just which just told you the only thing which you have to keep in",
  "told you the only thing which you have to keep in mind is that you have to select a specific keyword which is specific to that entire question only then you will be able to identify which question we are actually asking okay yeah and if you're not able to figure out which keyword to use in that case you can use function calling approach if there is nothing unique about this question like if there are can be identified then use function calling so uh basically you can combine both of these",
  "so uh basically you can combine both of these approaches use so the question parameter the question parameter will be a uh plain text or can be a Json PL text okay uh can you open G2 question to [Music] yes so uh here are two uh two questions related to this question so the first question is the image uh that are you seeing here the shapes image that contains shapes so the image will be sent as an attachment or it will be included as a base 64 string in the question parameter sent as attachment",
  "in the question parameter sent as attachment it will be sent as binary file okay so here we have to upload the image as the answer you can see that you will have to uh respond with the binary uh file itself like it should be image itself it should not be b64 encoded or anything it should be image okay we have to response by uh Json okay in Json we can give uh can we give uh I search that I uh that we have actually three ways we can give uh B 64 string or uh image U URL or a data URI can we uh",
  "string or uh image U URL or a data URI can we uh send binary can we do binary image there uh yeah so there is way to send files respond with the files a yeah have an example ready with you can I or should I look for on internet I can try it TR or maybe we can even ask GPT so what I think is that when you are actually sending a response using uh your API call in the function itself you can pass the the image also okay so that's possible so if we perhaps if we return the image then it will it",
  "we perhaps if we return the image then it will it would be able to run more Prim deep if you just uh head back to the project to uh page you'll be able to see that in over there the curl request the curl entire code which has been given to you uh you'll be able to see that we sending a post request and we also have a parameter for file right and over there we are passing a zip file you can see that so uh yeah we will be giving you the files attached to your attached to the uh request itself and",
  "to your attached to the uh request itself and then you'll able to work so yeah just here you can see uh the response must be a Json object it is written so in the answers below below the response yes this so we have to uh put the answer in the where there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 we our answer should be here so how can we uh put the image here in which [Music] format uh yeah you would have to respond with the like like there is a way to respond with image right now I don't have a example ready with me",
  "right now I don't have a example ready with me and it would take some time to uh actually create example so maybe later I will show you okay sir how will you handle deployment questions yeah so that is something that I we'll have a internal meeting and after that I can answer those questions if it can be actually deployed to verel and if it is it can be deployed then how the application is going to work so even if that is possible let's just suppose it's possible so the answer should return",
  "suppose it's possible so the answer should return with the link right uh yes so if there is some versal Development question then answer should return link because that is what you are submitting to the answer so you will check how whether the link is working or you will just check the format that yeah link is coming so it's okay uh so they will send a request to the link that you have provided like there is one API question I think this is the one over here you use submit a URL right yeah so",
  "one over here you use submit a URL right yeah so the question will be like it will be exact same question and then they will they used to verify it by sending some request right whenever you used to click on check button if it doesn't get the uh required data then it would just say this data doesn't exist or something like that so for now we can leave the GitHub and deployment questions right yeah yeah for now you can leave the GitHub questions or some questions which require some uh",
  "questions or some questions which require some uh installation of something or some questions like uh which which one Google collab usage so those questions do yeah so this is also something you can leave at the moment and enro you can leave at the moment last servers multiple FL servers running multiple flask server running yeah so that is also you can leave it at the moment we'll get back to how how those things will be handled but I don't think this will be possible in versal at all huh so",
  "this will be possible in versal at all huh so if it won't be possible in versal then we would come up with some alternative okay we'll definitely talk about it and that to in the very next session uh when is the next session uh possibly on uh Tuesday okay and I will also respond to your post I mean I haven't responded to it because we don't have answers it see s have already responded to some some of the posts but at the moment we don't have answer to uh these questions like uh what to do with",
  "to uh these questions like uh what to do with enro what to do with the uh deploying another server from Vell itself so those questions we don't have answers at the moment and yeah okay so uh I have uh I want to I want uh some guidance that how will I approach the questions I'm thinking that the questions uh first the all the ga questions I'm thinking to use uh text embedding of open Ai and store the embedding into some Vector database and then then when I get some post request the question",
  "then when I get some post request the question parameter I will change it to into uh text embedding using open I and then I will search for the similar similar and the most similar question I will use it's function calling yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah that that is really good approach you can keep embeddings ready for each of the question and then you can uh do some Matrix multiplications and then you can identify which question it is yeah that is very good approach and you can even use this uh",
  "very good approach and you can even use this uh string searching but for few questions if it doesn't work then that embedding one is definitely good approach so these combine both of them maybe just try which one is faster like first you can attempt to look for maybe actually I have not tried this in versel but uh there I don't know it it it is possible in verell or not that it will allow me to U run a v database and do that stuff I have to uh I have to do that I'm not sure if it will be",
  "uh I have to do that I'm not sure if it will be possible uh but you can store it in csvs as well right uh yes yeah that is yes it is not necessary to use a VOR database I can use nprr yeah NP you can keep I think NPR allows you to create files so you can write write write out those arrays to files and then whenever required you can read it back or you can even create a CSV in CSV you can have one column which is for question for example G5 question one okay that is unique identifier to identify",
  "one okay that is unique identifier to identify the question and then other column is embedding so for that question that embedding you can store it in CSV itself so Vector DB might not be required uh another thing to ask in for project one uh uh you have told that uh Anand sir have uh shared uh the show the TS the project one uh solution it is almost 150 lines and it can handle all the uh all the questions easily so when will uh the uh when will the question solution for project one will be",
  "the question solution for project one will be shown to us [Music] um because it will be very helpful for us in the project to just give me one minute [Music] uh so okay we'll try to we'll upload the file that that is available with us and then we'll also maybe we'll record a video of uh some 15 20 minutes in that we'll discuss that approach okay yeah tvin sir can you give an outline or like how to start this project to I'm not getting an idea how to start and like how to create an ID and deploy",
  "to start and like how to create an ID and deploy it in person is my screen visible I think don't okay now it is so yeah like so few questions you can do right now for example all ga3 questions those are the questions you can do and this deploy python API to this is something that we'll address it later how you can exactly do it apart from that uh so question come I mean uh who was that who ask the question I only ask yeah when did you join by the way H tell me when did you join the session uh I",
  "way H tell me when did you join the session uh I joined like 15 minutes ago 15 minutes ago right yeah okay uh so we have discussed how exactly you need to do this project like uh question will come through the request itself and the file will also come in the request this is how if there is some question which requires you to use some file then the file will come in the request itself and then this is how the answer should look like so if I just go to maybe G3 [Music] so yeah if this is the",
  "go to maybe G3 [Music] so yeah if this is the question so what what will come to you this won't come okay this long long long Vision model these videos all this won't come uh what will come in the request is this actual question this is the question right so this is what through the model and then this image will also come as the file okay okay so these are the things that will come through it okay okay but like uh did you show the coding part like how to code for basically rendering that SL",
  "like how to code for basically rendering that SL API in point and and how to push it to ourself in today's session we haven't okay yeah today's session we'll go through the later bit of ga3 uh six there are few things that are pending in that yeah okay yeah oh challenge yeah okay so I'll take over so for the rest of the session I'll be showing you guys how to make some visualizations in Python and then jaaj will be demonstrating the rest of the questions okay so let's get started uh okay so",
  "questions okay so let's get started uh okay so actually I was trying to uh look how you can send a file the response uh so that will take some time for the moment but uh it's possible I guess okay all right and here is the visualization okay so first we'll be looking at uh creating visualizations using some libraries like cbon C SNS and and okay it's import. by plot SP all right so uh these libraries which I have just imported these this cbone library and this mat Pro Library so these two",
  "library and this mat Pro Library so these two libraries are basically used for making visualizations in Python okay so actually the thing is that this cbon library is a dependent on matr Li to create its CLS so uh if you are going to use cbon then you have to install mport as well so that's one thing okay so uh we will be working with the load Iris data set uh with the iris data set not the load Iris one so uh let me just show you guys uh how the data looks like okay so this is the data and",
  "the data looks like okay so this is the data and let's extract it this is the one let's create a pandas data frame prod okay so this load this Irish data set is actually uh if you guys have gone through MLP course you must be you must know about this particular data set uh it's pretty famous and the thing is that in this data set we have about 150 rows of information about fls okay so we have three kinds of fls which are Iris Versa Iris versal and I guess IR irisa as well so these are the uh",
  "and I guess IR irisa as well so these are the uh these are the three fls we have been we are discussing here about and uh let me just store it in a data variable and what we're going to do is data and Dot columns should be Iris and feature names this is good okay so as you can see that because we were talking about fls we have four features over here in this data set which are SLE length SLE width petal length and petal width okay so basically this data set is generally used for machine",
  "this data set is generally used for machine learning purposes it's a very classic classification data set which uh on which you can run on which you can train classification models so uh the agenda for actually using this data set overhead is that I'll be showing you how you can create some visualizations using this using this data set okay so first and foremost let's have a look at some basic PLS which are like scatter PL and uh which is which are which is a scatter plot and then we will we",
  "are which is a scatter plot and then we will we will be looking at confusion Matrix as well okay so uh let's get started okay by the way I have to load the target variable as well because then we'll be using it to make some really good visualizations okay so here it is and uh let me check the keys and the keys are uh it's Target and Target names okay so uh this is the Target and stored in Target name St in Target okay let's check the target okay so these are the targets and also let's have a",
  "so these are the targets and also let's have a look at the Target names okay so these are satsa veral and virgin okay so it was virgin all right uh now uh okay so Zer are you doing it for GSX yeah for GS I'm just showing you guys how you can create visualizations in Python using M and C okay that's the only thing I'm not going to show you how how you are going to train M mod because that's not the agenda for for this Mee yeah obviously now uh okay so uh we got the targets and now I'm going to",
  "so uh we got the targets and now I'm going to create some uh attractive visualizations okay so I'll be using C Bound for this and let's create a scatter plot okay and it should be it's suggesting some things you and Target uh let's have a look at it okay uh okay takes position arguments I guess I have to apply do this like this and Y all right so uh what I did over here is that I just plotted uh graph which have the sep length at the x axis and The Petal length at the y- axis okay so as you can",
  "Petal length at the y- axis okay so as you can see that this is how we can this is how we can create some graphs in python as well okay and the cbon library so the thing about uh the thing about cbon and MPR is that cbon is a kind of upgraded version of M lip so M lip basically creates very generic cfts so if you just look at it and if you just look at the graphs created by mat so they are very generic and they they don't have the kind of modern taste in them okay but caborn is a really you",
  "taste in them okay but caborn is a really you know it has been it's a really good Library if you want to create really attractive charts uh it has some basic templates which you can use and that will allow you to create some beautiful charts okay so this was one and this is the scatter PL this is how you create a scatter PL okay so so this cbor I if you are wondering what this SNS is I just Alias it uh for C okay so SNS is the is the Alias for seone which is widely used around the world okay so",
  "which is widely used around the world okay so this is seone and we are creating a scatter plot so on the x-axis we have the SE length on the y axis we have the pag and can you guys tell me what is this Hue can anyone just guess it what is this H anyone label uh okay you are bit close but not exactly right use different shades of the color which is being given by like 01 and exactly ex so U is basically the colors which you want to give to the data points okay so each and every point over here",
  "points okay so each and every point over here is a data point right and uh you are able to see these colors these three colors over here because we have mentioned it over here okay if I just remove this you won't be able to see that okay now you got a uniform graph which has just a blue color so U parameter actually allows you to give some colors to your data and this target variable this target as we just saw so it contains the uh it contains the uh what should I what should we say the uh the",
  "uh what should I what should we say the uh the type of FL which we working with okay so zero means uh Iris stosa one means I guess Iris veral and two means Vin okay so this is how it works and we are giving this U parameter this a Target variable and then it's looking at okay so the first row comes where over over where we have the SE length and the petal petal length SE length and the petal length and then it checks so which hu does it belongs to which which kind of FL is it okay and it checks",
  "which which kind of FL is it okay and it checks that okay so it's Iris setosa okay so I will be coloring it with a different color and that's how it's coloring then okay so this is the Hue parameter now you must be thinking that uh these three colors are pretty ugly right but someone might think that these are really attractive but for me it's not the it's not to my taste so let's change it and if I'm not wrong uh for that we we have this pallet option given to us let's check it okay so it has",
  "option given to us let's check it okay so it has changed these colors but uh again this is not what I like so let's have a look uh if I just pass something else it should give me the expected okay so it's not giving me the expected so what we can do is uh let's set it to Reds let's check okay so giving the pallet giving the pallet this spring Reds it will just uh change theor over here to the shades of it okay so this is how it works uh I guess there was something else uh some was a really good",
  "was something else uh some was a really good one uh I guess it was magma okay so this one is also a good one if you want if you are looking to create some contrasting colors and uh yeah so as you can see that these three colors uh though they are ugly as well but they are a bit contrasting okay that's something which you can work so this pallet you can just Google some really attractive color palletes and you can use them so magma is the one which uh I uh generally I don't use but mostly uh",
  "which uh I uh generally I don't use but mostly uh it's a really good really good packet to use okay so uh that was it and uh let's head back to by the way guys any questions in this cater PL anyone with any questions anyone all right so let's move ahead to uh creating some more graphs and what I want to look at it uh let's do one thing let's create a uh confusion Matrix not a confusion Matrix a co-variance matrix so can anyone tell me what's a co-variance matrix anyone what's a co-variance",
  "a co-variance matrix anyone what's a co-variance matrix it shows the relationship between two variables and the correlation between exactly so uh let's have a look at our five top five rows and these are the top five rows let's create a correlation Matrix okay so if I do this now we can see that these are the correlations between these uh the are the correlations between the uh uh what should you say the correlation between these four variables with each other by the way this we are giving it's",
  "each other by the way this we are giving it's giving these NS because we actually pass the head if I just remove this it should yeah so now we got the actual correlations and you can see that we have the Seer length and the correlation with the Seer length is one obviously then we have seel width and the relation it has with the seple length and and it's pretty much towards the negative which means that if a flower have a pretty long seel length then the seel width would be releas hin okay",
  "then the seel width would be releas hin okay that's one thing which you can even relate from nature as well a particular FL which have a long seel length usually has a thin usually the seel is thin as well and when we have SEL which are uh really small the length is pretty much the when the length is when the length is really low the SLE width is usually thicker so is that the case let's check so yeah so obviously that's the case because this is a negative this is a negative correlation that",
  "is a negative this is a negative correlation that means that these two parameters go in the negative in the opposite directions okay so what we're going to do over here is that we are going to plot a uh here heat map okay heat map and let's check if it works or not perfectly it's working okay so what I will do is I will annotate true absolutely now you'll be able to see the values as well so uh this annotate uh function actually allows you to it actually allows you to see the values of the data",
  "actually allows you to see the values of the data okay so this what does this heat map actually tell you so this heat map as the name suggests it's kind of a map which uh which allows you to see uh where the uh density where the number is the highest okay so you can see over here on in this entire scale so if the number is really high it will be really high it will be a really light it would be really light color and if the number is really low then it would be a really dark color and that you",
  "then it would be a really dark color and that you can see over here moreover what we can do is we can change the P map as well so over there it was pallet right over there it was pallet here we have a cmap okay because we are dealing with heat map right so we have a c map over here and this will change the color of your uh maps of your uh should we say of a diagram or a plot okay we also have the these uh Singleton colors which usually I prefer because uh let's say this is this is the one for",
  "because uh let's say this is this is the one for Reds you also have for greens as well uh this green is not present okay so it's greens not green okay so we have one for greens as well and uh the the very uh so the advantage using these single turn colors is that you are able to identify which uh which particular box has the highest Den it which box has the highest number and which has the lowest number because something which you can't actually sometimes get not get along with this for example",
  "sometimes get not get along with this for example I just use this magma one now you have to constantly check this particular scale over here right but for but when you're using these single ter colors that's pretty simple you can just guess okay so this is a deep red that means that means it it is a higher value and they have a uh White and that means it's a really low value okay so so that that's how you actually create a few visualizations in using cbond and these exact things these uh things",
  "cbond and these exact things these uh things can also be done using mattl but again uh I don't think that mattl actually has a heat map function present okay so I would recommend you guys to go ahead and look into more functionalities of cbon and it's a really good library for for creating visualizations moreover there is one thing that you can explore is that how you can change the font the font style of these text which is written okay this is also which is possible in C on you can just go",
  "is also which is possible in C on you can just go ahead and check on the net okay so uh I guess that's enough to show you how you can create some visualizations rest I will leave it up to you to explore just go ahead and go to the seon documentation so I guess it was just search cbon talks and then you will be able to they've also created a pretty uh good website as well you can just go ahead and explore it okay you can create a multitude of visualizations as you can see okay so yeah uh next",
  "as you can see okay so yeah uh next for the next session uh Jr will be taking over all right by the way guys any questions regarding this cbon or should we move ahead has any questions is this low data should be same right uh this low low data should be same right across the yeah absolutely that same so the thing is that this load iris is been imported from the skars uh data set module so that that's going to be same for everyone all right you can take over [Music] [Music] so this is about",
  "can take over [Music] [Music] so this is about reading how you can read parket files in page itself so it is pd. read paret and then this in inspection is like we have functions such as if I go to Panda's documentation [Music] [Music] so this is one of the inbuild function that is there which gets us if if we just look at the example uh then uh we have Alpha Beta and these are the things and if I do DF do info this gets us the information about each the column how many null values are there and",
  "the column how many null values are there and then it also tells about the data type all right so like if you have some column which is kind of object but actually it is a date then you can pass it using date time module so if I just go over here uh so this would get so this would get us the r day uh let's just go get D time module itself uh documentation [Music] so if the date is in this format and then you can create a new date by using this function uh basically [Music] [Music] yeah so this",
  "uh basically [Music] [Music] yeah so this is what I was talking about so this is the function right like you have a date and from date this is to locate week day uh if you want the week day like whether it is Monday Sunday or these things and then this would also get uh this this would just get the abbreviated name and then this would get the full name this will get Sunday as Sunday and this will get it as Su n then this would get you in decimals then this would get d uh if it is date is like",
  "then this would get d uh if it is date is like today it is 6th so if you have a date uh so this is the date which is in this format D and then percentage M and percentage y so each of these symbols are mentioned over here if it is year without century and then this is year with the century like if it is 2014 2013 all these are over here and this for get the how so you can create a new date object by using this function let me just create one date [Music] and we first need to import [Music]",
  "date [Music] and we first need to import [Music] daytime and let me just past it over here um has no attribute what was the V to import it I think maybe from date time import date time and now it have created this date so it have assigned d as 31st and then month as 01 so this is the actual date and then this is the time and then dollar F what it stands for let's have a look at it uh it stands for the microc seconds uh with six decimal interpretation now uh using this we can just get the dollar",
  "now uh using this we can just get the dollar a which would get the name and then it will separate it using spaces so all this we can Define over here let me just copy this from here [Music] let's call it date one or maybe something like [Music] that and then date 1 do St Str ft i m s r ft M and let's just look for ERS e so it gets us Monday right now if I just put a comma and then if I put M present D this will get the month day um sorry week day and along with the date and it will put put a",
  "day and along with the date and it will put put a separator like comma you can change the separator instead of comma if you want some other separator maybe this one so it just gets it in this format so this is how you you can pass dates so these are different abbreviates like uh let's say if I just want month then it should be % B so this have got us the month all right so this is D time module and then in pandas this is how you can get the information about it and then sometimes you might get",
  "about it and then sometimes you might get a question like on so you you can get so one of the column could be of date type which have valid date and now you need to apply some filter uh let us say you just want to identify if how many wedness days are there or some some question like that so if there are multiple dates and then you just want to apply some filter on the day itself so that's what you can do using our daytime module uh which is this one okay and then this statistical significance",
  "one okay and then this statistical significance is related to correlations and those things which are already part of it uh which we sh have done in one of the session using Excel and then this percentage calculation this is also something that can be done and then this PIV tables is very well explained in uh this video itself so if I just go [Music] to it is similar to excel P tables so over here they have even showed the example then we are using column C so we are pivoting based on column C",
  "column C so we are pivoting based on column C and then we are doing the aggregation some sum and these things so if I go to column C if we have a small over here right and then the other value is large then we are summing up on that so like you have a small a small a small a small and a small and then in uh right now we are not considering yeah values it is considering from column D so this these are the values which it will consider so all these values will come from that and then we have",
  "these values will come from that and then we have column b as well which is index kind of thing and column A so like a and b if it is bar okay uh so if it is bar in column A so these are the all the columns that are there and then if it is one so bar and one these are two which are there now we need to Pivot them based on column C right so from column C we have just one value for large so it will create one column with large which we have four and then it will so now if you look at bar and two",
  "then it will so now if you look at bar and two so these are the two columns which will get selected and now if you look at large so this is the only one it will create something like that uh if there are multiple uh columns which get selected let us see if there are two columns which have large then it will just add those two entries so if we go to Fu these are all the four entries in a now if you look for all the ones these are all the ones and then if you look at in column C if you look at",
  "then if you look at in column C if you look at large these are the two which will get selected now we need to L some we need to just aggregate them so it will just add these to values so it will it is four and then one and after one uh in large it should be four that is there then if we look for uh F and then two if we look for large it doesn't have anything in large because there are no column that that's why it is getting none so these are the things that are possible using uh pivoting and",
  "things that are possible using uh pivoting and then this just gets creates some tabular structure which we can use in answering some questions and then data visualization is something that Shan have already talked about and now let's have a look at one of these uh notebooks which are there so it is worth going through the um course content which is available on TDS course portal so it reads through the parket file uh this is not required yeah this is structure of data anyway there are few",
  "this is structure of data anyway there are few questions yeah so this is the one which uses value count so these are different functions which you can use and I think it just have something related to pivot table as well so this is the [Music] one so how has percentage of disputed transactions change over time so actually in order to explain this you would have to go through the uh data set first you would need to understand the data set and then you would have to identify what exactly we need",
  "you would have to identify what exactly we need to do so it will if it is index like that was one example let me just open it again so over here it is index so it will create these to below the so it is now aggregating columns and now over here we don't we haven't provided columns so this is another us case where we are just we are not using anything columns so it doesn't have columns so if you go here then it have index as however but it does have d right so this is D like in Excel we used to",
  "d right so this is D like in Excel we used to create one uh row on top and then we used to have how uh let me just show like you must be aware about how your tables look in Excel maybe image [Music] so this is how it gets segregated like some on build and these things anyway and over here they have creators from heat map that is also regarding suggestion itself and uh so I want to go deeply into that notebook so this is something you can explore and then the SQL one [Music] so establishing a",
  "and then the SQL one [Music] so establishing a connection with the database like if there are some my SQL database which is hosted somewhere publicly if you have got the password for that database which is hosted somewhere but if you have got the password so this is connection history which tells about like what is the host name and then port number and then username password and database these are the four or five things which are required in order to connect to a database so this is my SQL is",
  "to connect to a database so this is my SQL is the type of the database and then this guest is usern name so these are the different things you need to provide it should be in this same structure and this is the password and then this is username and then we are connecting to uh this particular host on and the name of the database and port number we haven't provided port number because it is the default one if we don't provide it it will connect to the default one but if you just take this",
  "to the default one but if you just take this example and then if you ask how to add port number to it it will tell you port number two this connection string so after host we would need to provide it so after host we need to provide the port number and then after that name of the database so it is similar to like we used to put Local Host and then uh port number which which is 8,000 or something on which your fast API is working and then name of the API so it is similar kind of structure so",
  "of the API so it is similar kind of structure so this is how you can connect to a publicly available which is a aable on server or somewhere uh you can connect to that database and once you connect to that database actually this SQL alate allows you to create uh establish connection to remote databases you can connect to postgress database you can connect to my SQL database or some other database as well once you have establish the connection you can query that database like over here they are",
  "can query that database like over here they are just counting for the number of post and then uh here we have few more things like this is also basic equal query uh which is counting all the number of um rows and then it is using average for each and then it is using some it is is doing some aggregation kind of thing okay yeah I have python function that so these are things that so based on question itself we need to create a query but any like once you have got so like once you have uh wait a",
  "once you have got so like once you have uh wait a second so over here we are using pd. read SQL right so we can even use um something like this DF is equal to P SQL and then we can get the whole data in a data frame once we get the data in the data frame um let me just execute it and then let me just execute this one as well [Music] uh this is because of some import error I would have to import few things actually it is available on my local machine uh no no it's not in this machine it is in",
  "uh no no it's not in this machine it is in some other machine so I won't be able to show but yeah so you would have to import this module by MySQL and then once you so this would allow to get the whole data and it will store it in DF so this is one after you got it in the DF you can do a lot of things which is just pandf whatever you want to apply on that and then from uh so also you can make a query for some we conditions and then you can also Group by things so all this is available over here",
  "by things so all this is available over here so few examples are here okay just go through them once so this is one of the important one yeah so in Duck DB you can so basically the benefit of using dug DB is it is much more faster uh it works at a very high speed so if I just open this one I think it have exam uh I will have to download it all right [Music] [Music] yeah so over here they are using our data frames andb is faster that's what is mentioned over here and then there must be one uh",
  "mentioned over here and then there must be one uh query so in Duck DB takes 25.9 me uh milliseconds and some extra seconds or some less seconds and this same thing um yeah over here it takes 5 Seconds using a data frame and in the same thing if we do it in duct DB it is much more faster like it just takes 160 second millisecond this is for Speed and it can handle a lot of things like CSV it can handle then uh Json it can handle and then yeah we just need to install like uh if I just go back to",
  "just need to install like uh if I just go back to the same this is the one and somewhere over here so this is how you can import the DB and then you can query something out of it so and then DF it queries from the data frame itself no no uh basically it carries from this parket file and then it transfer it makes data frame out of it yeah so this this can change it can be a CSC file or it can even be a a Json file so multiple files it can handle so this bit of code which is here just import the",
  "so this bit of code which is here just import the ddb and then dub. query it allows you to execute queries and then it also allows you to use parket files or CSC files some other any other file so whatever you do in pandas it might take time but if you do the same thing in ddb it takes very less time it is just 160 milliseconds whereas in Panda it was taking 5.4 seconds 160 millisecond is how much I think 1 second have th000 milliseconds right it is less than 1 second which is if you compare",
  "it is less than 1 second which is if you compare them it is huge difference and then you are aware about how you can uh join data from multiple files which is uh using join operators let me show you what are those join SQL operators so these are different kind of join so inner join uh if like I would need an example uh yeah most of the time this inner join is very useful uh like if you have multiple tables um it is worth taking example if they have let's first have a look at what is there in",
  "have let's first have a look at what is there in all right um so inner join is like let us say you want to join on order ID and you want to fetch all the orders uh all the orders which are given by some customer or someone somebody so we have customer table and then we also have orders table and then another table would be customer uncore order or something so uh let me just open one text editor yeah so we have table one and let's call it uh uh maybe table one and this is the below what I'm",
  "uh maybe table one and this is the below what I'm writing is data of table and name let's call it one and then name is uh let's give and then two and then it can be T and then we have another table table two which have ID and then uh work they are doing so let's call it one and then over here we have rikic hello hey Ric all right let's just give R is a student okay and now we don't have any entry for Tanya and now if I just do inner join on these two tables then what I will get is can anyone",
  "two tables then what I will get is can anyone guess what will I get join now you only get I think yes exactly you will only get twick so you will get ID name and work so all these fields you will get from both D tabls okay so ID will be one and then name will be rck and then a student is the work okay so this is what you will get if you perform the inner join so the way to do inner join is you can use if you are doing it in pandas you use pandas pd. merge is yeah and then uh we provide some",
  "pd. merge is yeah and then uh we provide some left is equal to the table one and then write is equal to table two and how is equal to Inner and then we also need to provide on so on which attribute you want to do we want to do on ID so this is how it is possible and then we can even use okay let me just go back to [Music] yeah uh so how you can do it in let me just show Panda's merge function so this is Left Right and let's just have a look at one of the example so this is the one this will",
  "one of the example so this is the one this will perform our default it is inner and then it can to left join right join and then outer join so these are the different joins which are there this is outer Jo join so what it does like uh if there is this this is not available right if I just do outer join then it will also get two for T but in work it will get null it won't get anything over here so this is outer join and then right outer join so we have two tables right uh right and left uh so if",
  "have two tables right uh right and left uh so if I want to keep everything from the right table so table two if I want to keep everything but in table one I don't want to keep something that is not there so those short of things which we can do so this is something that can be used and it ALS it is also available in SQL itself like inner join and I think for outer join it is outer uh so these examples are here inner join then left join right join full join this is example for full join okay on",
  "full join this is example for full join okay on this is G3 anyway doesn't required so yeah this is the one of the videos which is very nice I don't like I won't be demonstrating it but uh going just watch this video this is very nice one and this is in Python so in Python this is your P notebook so you have two M two different locations and then between those two locations you can calculate the distance and then the density how many stores are there those kind of analysis are done over here so",
  "those kind of analysis are done over here so just go through this these things like this is  nomina these things which you would have already used in Ro itself so there is nothing new to it this gets is the one which calculates the distance and then 2 kilometers and the multiple different formats so mostly this file have distances itself and once you get the distance uh you can plot it using fium so folium is the uh python module which allows you to create these kind of interactive maps like",
  "you to create these kind of interactive maps like you can put these markers right so all these things are available in fum not marker and these things and then this is again some this is for farthest um points and then these are for closest point those kind of analysis are done yeah and just go through this video and you will get to know about what is there okay so these are the modules goopi is for calculating distances volume is for creating maps and then nump is for doing calculations of",
  "maps and then nump is for doing calculations of distances and those kind of formulas you can apply in numai and yeah Q just and just give me one minute oh let's first get through this one [Music] so so in this one Kuma is the one which allows you to create network graphs and then SK Network and let me just open this note this one [Music] [Music] [Music] can anyone tell about what is clust string grouping similar data together B yes it is kind of binning itself like uh basically in clustering so",
  "binning itself like uh basically in clustering so there is something called classification in which we try to classify particular data set and data sample and then in clustering we tries to put multiple points will be there and then we would try to analyze the natural clusters which are there so it creates these kind of clusters this is one cluster this is another [Music] cluster uh sh yeah is there something that you want to add to network SK network uh SK Network um oh yeah what we can do is",
  "uh SK Network um oh yeah what we can do is uh I actually created some visualizations using kumu and I can show that so [Music] [Music] okay okay guys okay is M visible all right so uh this particular graph in kumu I uh buil when I was can you mute your mic okay so this particular graph in Kum I made when I was uh dealing with my BDM project so one part where I had to create this uh flow chart kind of was that when I had to show uh a a diagrammatical representation of Market Basket analysis so",
  "representation of Market Basket analysis so the entire uh so Market Market Basket analysis is a technique where we pair items we pair products which are more inclined to be buy together which are more likely to be bu together and I did that analysis in Python and then to demonstrate to kind of visualize that entire relation between these items I had to create this particular flow chart so uh as you can see that I have added uh multiple uh kind of elements and then we have these arrows between",
  "of elements and then we have these arrows between them and as you can see that these arrows symbolize that there is a there's a kind of relation between these two items and obviously you can simply edit this particular uh uh this particular each and every element we can I guess we can add some descriptions to these lines as well so what I will do is I can try create a new chart and show it to you well uh the thing is that I haven't used kumu since I completed with my PDM project but I will just",
  "I completed with my PDM project but I will just try to use it once again try to make sense of it so uh I guess I have to uh okay okay okay I guess this is going to this okay so yeah here we are and uh I just sign in once so yeah KO is a really good tool when you have to uh create visualizations which have kind of a network uh in them okay so let's through this process so I'll name it uh let's say TDS live session demo okay I'm not a robot create project so kumu is a kind of tool which is",
  "create project so kumu is a kind of tool which is generally used for network type of just generally used to create network type of GRA so as you can see that we have been given multiple options to choose from and these are kind of templates on which the entire graph would be made so this is the systems template which I used in my case there are multiple other kinds of uh multiple other charts as well so as you can see that there is a stakeholder chart there's a casual Loop chart as well then a",
  "chart there's a casual Loop chart as well then a big data which perhaps will have multiple clusters in them and then uh yeah so we have geographical graphs as well over where we can show we can show the network between some geographical locations and uh we have some custom charts as well so let's go ahead with the systems one and get started okay so for that we I guess this is how we do it first we'll be adding an element uh let's say uh let's imagine what we have to do here um okay so let's",
  "imagine what we have to do here um okay so let's create a chart for our BS degree uh BS data science and application flowchart where we are going to show how uh how uh different levels of BS degree are combined are uh let me just start making it then I will explain it to you so first would be the foundation level okay so this is what I'm trying to do so this is the foundation level and uh we can also change the also change the font and the color so let's change it to something uh attractive",
  "so let's change it to something uh attractive let's go with uh let's go with this one this is pretty good okay this is good as well okay and let's change it and the text also it should be white much better and let's make it bold and then the label uh all these things are pretty good so I need to change them I'll add one more uh element over here let's create let's make it uh this should be the diploma so let's write the diploma in data science all right here we have it and again I will be",
  "all right here we have it and again I will be creating one more element which is the diploma in data science or programming diplom programming uh okay so here we have our two elements and now I'll be creating a connection okay by the way this level of magnification on my screen is it uh visible to everyone or should I magnify it even more what you guys say anyone sir it is visible all right so okay so this is good and I will be creating a new connection and the label name is foundation level",
  "connection and the label name is foundation level right it's Foundation level and then diploma in data science a connection between these two and enter so as we can see that uh a connection has been established between these two and moreover you can see that the colors so because we had blue color over here and then we had a gray over here so the line which is connecting these two elements is a kind of gradient okay so that's a pretty good touch from kumu uh again it's Foundation right and then",
  "from kumu uh again it's Foundation right and then we have programming diploma okay this is as well and uh there should be something like this this is much better okay so now let's create another element and I will name it a BS level here we have it and uh we'll establish a connection between these two so uh what we can do is uh yeah let's make a connection from diploma in data science to BS level and then a connection from programming to PS that's pretty good and let's adjust the arrows as well",
  "pretty good and let's adjust the arrows as well because you know Aesthetics should always be followed and let's create a new element and this this would be the final one the BS level uh okay this one now let's add a new connection it would be from BSC level to BS level perfect and now you can change the colors of these levels as well so I will be changing the color of these two uh and I will keep it uh let's go with a orange okay by the way I'm not going to pay much attention to what kind of",
  "not going to pay much attention to what kind of Aesthetics I'm going the head with but uh you guys can just create much more aesthetic uh you know goodlook flow charts okay the be white that's good then BS level it would be color let's keep it a green okay and the font let's keep it a white pretty good now let's go ahead with the BS level and let's keep it deep red because it's the final boss of this entire degree right so this is good and this is a basic flowchart which you can create in kumu",
  "is a basic flowchart which you can create in kumu and it's pretty good as well right so I will just I will recommend you guys to go ahead and explore with kumu explore what all you can do so this is just one kind of graft which I just demonstrated which is a system systems graph you can create multiple other types of graphs like a stakeholder graph which I just showed you uh you know big data chart so all these things are possible and just so just go ahead and check these out and use them in",
  "just go ahead and check these out and use them in your uh data projects okay so this is uh introduction of kumu uh any questions regarding this guys any questions by the way I can see only seven of us are left excluding me jaraj and my screen we have only four people left uh so guys I will recommend you guys to just speak up because yeah I only briefly there okay please repeat I was only briefly there I had to go for a meeting in between okay okay so guys anyone uh who has any problems okay",
  "okay so guys anyone uh who has any problems okay this is a pretty good one uh let's go ahead with the next one so are we going to discuss anything more yeah yeah for sure we will be discussing folium we I will be showing you guys a demonstration of folium and then we'll be going ahead with the network X Library and then perhaps I will show you clustering as well so yeah actually I and J were just having a chat so just give us 2 minutes more all right guys so uh we are back and uh next I'll be",
  "right guys so uh we are back and uh next I'll be showing you a pretty good example of folium as well okay so as we discussed asaj uh discussed with you so folium is a library is a python Library using which you can create geographical Maps like this one geographical uh charts like this one okay so this is another one of my BDM project charts so yeah so if you so yeah I use TDS extensively in my BDM project and it helped me quite a lot so people have been asking us so it has been so at the very",
  "have been asking us so it has been so at the very beginning of the course people has been asking so what's the use of introducing so that many number of tools to us we are not from a technical background and blah blah blah blah blah but the thing is that as you can see that uh I had TDS before my BDM project and it held me so much that uh you know I was able to complete my BDM project within a month which usually takes about four months time okay so uh you know this is how TDS has been helping",
  "so uh you know this is how TDS has been helping me and I hope that it will help you as well okay so this is a basic demonstra of now we cannot really complete it in a month because now they've structured it in such a way that we have to wait oh really like you cannot like the propos proposal is only released after the midterm deadline is over so now we canot that that's pretty bad okay okay so uh this person is by okay so we have only uh three people left so I will recommend you guys to just",
  "people left so I will recommend you guys to just stay along with us till the very end okay so this is uh the demonstration of volume as and as you can see that what I did over here is that I imported folium that's pretty understood I imported fum then I create then I created a variable name which is just a mapper and I created a map using folium okay I just gave it it a start location so this particular location which I just gave it this is a center point of the map okay and the center point is",
  "point of the map okay and the center point is actually this shop okay so this is the shop which uh I did the BDM project with and these all these locations are the all these locations are the points where uh all these locations are the points where also probably take your leave because like I okay all right all right bye okay so uh then we are adding a child okay so what is a child it's just uh an element over here so all these different pointers are the elements or all these different pointers",
  "are the elements or all these different pointers are the child are the children of this particular map okay so first we added this then I added this particular there then I just ran a for Loop where are adding multiple children into this entire map we are adding uh these markers and also you can change the the icon which is being uh which which will be displayed in place of these uh locations so all these locations which are being mapped using these uh for Loop are present are being represented",
  "uh for Loop are present are being represented in this Arrow Head and then uh red marker so that's how uh you usually create maps with fold okay so that's one representation all right so next we are going to work along with network X okay and for that uh for that let me have a look if we have a better data to work with or Not by the way guys do you have any questions in that uh polium part T any questions in that F part uh show that once again the code oh yeah sure uh I want to look at the child",
  "code oh yeah sure uh I want to look at the child one yeah uh you added one location here in the child uh so this is the location of the shop actually so this is the location of the shop which has to be in a different icon to be representable okay so this is the house icon I'm representing the shop with and the rest of the locations are the uh are the possible locations where the shop can explore its business in okay so that's why I'm using a for first line indicates which one first line okay uh",
  "first line indicates which one first line okay uh this one yeah so this is actually the instance we creating the map okay so over here we are creating the map and uh as you can see that we have given this location as well now you must be wondering that I added a child over here which has the same location right yeah over uh and over here I also added the same location so this map instance is actually going to create the map and this location given over here is a center point with which the map",
  "over here is a center point with which the map will be created so if I just run this once again and you can see that the shop is in the very middle of this entire map okay so this is how that uh uh instance is working okay so uh it just starts the it just centers the location which I gave it over there and then uh we are able to I am creating a map okay by so only has left in the class yeah and uh this one for Loop this for Loop is just creating this for Loop is just creating uh these random",
  "this for Loop is just creating uh these random location no no these are not random these these locations are not random these are just the uh these are the points where the business can actually explore its uh you know they can go ahead and search some markets over here so that's what I actually wanted to display over here and these red pointers so that's the reason behind these red pointers so I just ran a for Loop which had these locations uh these latitudes and longitudes present so this is",
  "these latitudes and longitudes present so this is actually the array which has these latitudes and longitudes okay okay okay okay okay so so this is how I'm creating this so uh that's the part for uh fum uh T let's do one thing uh because I have to search for a part uh certain data set which would be able which using which I would be able to explain the networkx library and you are the only person who is left in this meeting so let's just end this meeting and continue it in the next one what",
  "this meeting and continue it in the next one what you say okay all right thank you for being being with us for till the very end and asking some questions and actually interacting with us thank you T okay thank you sir okay bye good night bye good night [Music]",

So I just wanted to get a confirmation. Yes sir, you're audible. All [Music] [Music] right. Amen. [Music] Strength difficult is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] It is perfect. [Music] J everything okay? Uh can you send me a link to TDS portal? Oh yeah. [Music] Okay. I've sent it in the chat window. Okay. [Music] [Music] [Music]",
  "in the chat window. Okay. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Yeah. Okay. Okay. Is my screen visible? Yeah, it is visible. So, you are able to see uh Firefox browser, right? [Music] Oh, yeah. I'm able to see the Firefox browser. Yeah. Okay. I don't know. For some reason, it's not visible for me. So, I thought it's not visible. [Music] I don't know what are these features anyway. [Music] [Music] Uh yeah Telvin you have anything to ask? Yeah before that I want to ask in the markdown of like our main",
  "I want to ask in the markdown of like our main page is there TDS page there is no project markdown. Yeah. No no that one. Yeah. If you see this page right? Yeah there is no project to details. Yeah it is here right? No no left side if you see the sidebar. uh sidebar. Okay. Yeah, it is not there. Yeah. Yeah. Just add this one. Okay. People might think it's not really set up. H even uh these FAQs are not there after 5th of February. I did not answer that. It was something. Okay. Uh but I think if",
  "that. It was something. Okay. Uh but I think if we go to this page and over here uh it is visible. Okay. Then it will get added here. [Music] Uh so this is one uh tool notebook LM I have used it for uh I don't know what what I was doing with it on 2nd March what I was doing it with uh on 28th but yeah this is some tool it is kind of ra tool retrieable augmentation generation so if you give some uh sources to it. So you can attach any file at the moment I don't have any files downloaded because",
  "moment I don't have any files downloaded because I just uh installed a new OS today only. Okay. So right now it have this mock_4.pdf. It is some file and then you can select this file and let us say if I just upload some book or something uh like what can I upload at the moment? Let me see from here if I can do something. So if I go to academics uh and then diploma [Music] level diploma level and I think there is one book in MLF [Music] uh show all and uh where is the book? I thought there",
  "all and uh where is the book? I thought there should be book something. Okay, let us say if you have some book then what you can do you can provide that book as a reference over here. You can upload that book to your local machine and once you upload basically you can upload 50 uh files over here and then you can ask questions from these resources and if you ask any question it will generate a answer from that response uh that file itself. Let me check what is there in this. Yes. Am I audible?",
  "check what is there in this. Yes. Am I audible? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sharing a link to a book on the chat box. Is it downloadable? Yeah, it's a GitHub link. You can download it. Okay. But then uh All right. We can download it and then we'll ask some question. Uh it should be specifically from this book. If we can ask something. Uh Shan, have you gone through this book? Yeah, I have read the entirety of So is there something that is unique that we can ask from this book itself? Uh actually this",
  "can ask from this book itself? Uh actually this book contains uh a very very simplistic version a very simplistic explanation of what are neural networks and how you can create your own neural networks. So yeah, they can ask them about uh deep learn some deep learning questions like what are neural networks, what are neurons and that's what okay but all right that is very generic but uh okay let's try that uh it's been downloaded I guess maybe you can try and ask something from that uh part one",
  "can try and ask something from that uh part one where there is uh something probably very specific to that book you look at like about the author or Yeah, if you go back to that book. Oh, sure. Have a look. Yeah. So, it says easy for me, hard for you. Let's just have a quick look. There's something specific we can ask from there. [Music] So, most basic question should we ask something related to author or someone? Yeah, could do. [Music] We could also instruct it to give its answers based on",
  "also instruct it to give its answers based on the book's context only. Yeah, that I can do. All right. Uh this is this book we have got. Let me first upload it here. Uh okay, let me open it and copy the path and let's upload it to which tab is it? Uh I don't remember. Or is this this one or this one or this [Music] one? Okay. Like create a new one and then I'll add resource and then upload a resource and over here from down downloads select this book. [Music] [Music] [Music] So now we can ask",
  "book. [Music] [Music] [Music] So now we can ask any question related to this uh book itself over here. It will not have used in it. It won't generate anything outside this book. So it will try to uh generate response from this book itself. Like if I [Music] ask explain about [Music] uh neural networks and then I think it will fetch So if I just click over here and then if I go click to this point then it gets me to that uh portion of this book where it have been returned. So like it it gets to",
  "it have been returned. So like it it gets to different portions. So it generates this information this information uh from this book itself and then it points to different sections of the book where these information is being written and then I can even generate uh the audio explanation out of it. So like if I ask something and then I can generate some audio out of it and then it will generate some audio. it will take a long time maybe 5 to 10 minutes so it used to take a long time anyway I",
  "minutes so it used to take a long time anyway I won't do that so this is something you can practice with like uh you give some uh reference some sources and then it will uh generate based on that source itself Raj yeah I have I have uploaded one more link in the chat box so this is actually the the entire book of the song of ice and fire the book the book series on which the game of thrones universe is based upon. So yeah. So like like for generating some audio story out of this book, this tool",
  "some audio story out of this book, this tool can do like you can ask a particular question specific question very specific question and then whatever response it generates you can transcribe to it to audio and whatever it will generate it will be very good like if you hear to it it will sound like realistic. So if you guys have watched the first season of Game of Thrones and if you just want to give it a try using this PDF then you can go ahead and do that. So it would be a fun experience for",
  "and do that. So it would be a fun experience for you all of you. By the way J if you want you can uh just demonstrate this one as well. Uh because you know neural networks was something you know very generic and just like you said. So if you want you can just demonstrate this as well. Yeah that is something that I can do. uh but I I mean anyway I won't be able to generate the audio but if we ask something and then if we ask to generate audio I have heard to the audio that it generates it's very",
  "heard to the audio that it generates it's very good I mean so there is also uh an available sample that's on the tools in data science site itself so there's a podcast um in data analysis I don't know how many of you have listened to it um and it is if you go to the top of data analysis. Uh it says data analysis introduction podcast. If you click on that, yeah, this is the one. It's really really phenomenal and I think this is generated by notebook, right? Uh yes, it's generated by notebook. In",
  "right? Uh yes, it's generated by notebook. In fact, uh I would use the previous one data sourcing because that's even better actually as an example. Uh this is the one uh this one doesn't have. Okay. Okay. Cuz there was one I think last term and it was good. Try data preparation cuz I remember one of them had a very good either data sourcing or data. Uh that that one I think it also had some video as well, right? Let's see. Anyway, we can try one of these uh and see because it's already",
  "try one of these uh and see because it's already available. It's already been generated. Yeah. By the way, just out of curiosity, how many of you have heard the podcast? Yeah, [Music] this I think students generally generally don't used to open uh this portal. They just used to open G I think mostly. Okay, no one watched the podcast. All right, guys. So uh like statistical analysis such as correlation and then uh regression and then forecasting and then outlier using spreadsheets. Uh this is",
  "and then outlier using spreadsheets. Uh this is something that is there in this module. And then uh this aggregate using Python and then databases and then geo data uh using geopand and QGS. And then this is plot visualizing geod data using maps and these things and then this is network analysis using network and then this is storytelling. All right, let's go through these things. [Music] Uh Shange. Yeah. Can you take this part like correlation regression and forecast? Yeah sure. I don't have",
  "regression and forecast? Yeah sure. I don't have access to paid version of Excel. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. All right, guys. Is my screen visible? [Music] Okay. Is my screen visible? Just give me a thumbs [Music] up. All right. Okay. So, that's pretty good. Okay. So uh this is the analysis part. So in this particular module we are getting started with data analysis. Okay. So up till now you have seen how you can use developer tools, how you can extract data, then how you can kind of use LLM to extract",
  "data, then how you can kind of use LLM to extract data or perhaps do some task for you. Then we after project one we saw how you can source data. So data sourcing is basically from where you can actually get the data from. Okay. Okay. So there are multiple other ways you can get the data. You can get it from Kaggle. Let's say that's one really uh know it's highly it's a highly used platform to get data from. Then there are multiple API endpoints you can get the data nominating Wikipedia and",
  "you can get the data nominating Wikipedia and whatnot. Then we taught you about data preparation. Okay. And now we talking now we're talking about binary data analysis. Okay. So this is actually an entire pipeline in which data is actually processed which is firstly you have to identify the data source then you have to prepare the data for some kind of analysis which includes like uh manipulating values uh filling none values and you know uh just making data eligible for some kind of analysis",
  "making data eligible for some kind of analysis some kind of s analysis. Okay. So now the part comes of data analysis and over here we are going to look at multiple analysis techniques that we can perform on uh data and first and foremost we are getting started with correlation with Excel. Okay. So correlation is something that you guys must be uh really familiar with because it was a question in ro was the last question in ro and perhaps the most easiest one to get through. Uh yeah so it was",
  "easiest one to get through. Uh yeah so it was just a kind of free marks for anyone who tried to attempt that question. Okay so uh let me see where my uh data is. Okay, I'll just head back to the DDS portal and I'll download that particular JSON file here and DSP shape and SS 6. All right. So my data is saved and uh yeah so I will be using this particular JSON file for uh demonstrating the correlation part because that will work perfectly well because I have the answer to that question as well.",
  "I have the answer to that question as well. Okay. So in this question we were asked to give the PSN correlation coefficient and that's what we are going to calculate. Okay. So uh now you guys must be thinking that this is not a CSV file, this is not an Excel file, this is a JSON file. How can I use Excel in this? Right? Can anyone answer this question? How can I use Excel to actually work upon a JSON file? Anyoneu Tanya Chush Nilima and student number 1729 anyone any with a slight test idea or",
  "number 1729 anyone any with a slight test idea or just a guess how are we going to approach this problem? How can I actually use Excel to you know work with a JSON file? Anyone? So, convert this file online. Yeah, that's a pretty good solution. We can convert it to online. But what's a much more faster way to do it? All right. So, I'll show you guys. So, in Excel, so Excel is a really robust tool. It's a really, you know, it's a very well-made tool. I would say you can do a lot of things on",
  "tool. I would say you can do a lot of things on Excel which you can do in pandas or Python. Okay. So, one of the things is importing JSON files. And for that just go to the data tab. Just go over here. Just go to this uh get and transform data options this particular panel and click on get data. Okay. Just click over this button. Then it will ask you from a file surely from a file and then from JSON. Okay. So this is how you can actually access JSON data in Excel. So rather than going to uh",
  "JSON data in Excel. So rather than going to uh particular site search first of all just opening Google then searching for it converting it to CSV and then perhaps it will charge it will ask you to you know just pay me something so that I could do it otherwise there are multiple free options as well but that's a really long task that's not a much time consuming task but it's a long task I would say so it's simply you can you can load your JSON files in Excel using this technique. So yeah, just",
  "in Excel using this technique. So yeah, just click on get data in the data tab, then from file and from JSON right now. Let's hope it works. Uh where is it? [Music] uh investigation and uh this should be scalation report. Let's check. Okay. So this is like this. Uh do uh okay let me just inspect the the file once. So over here this one uh here it is. Okay. So it is the file is like this. Okay. And then it should give me what I'm expecting it to give. Uh it's probably unusual sir. Uh I guess it",
  "give. Uh it's probably unusual sir. Uh I guess it was uh let me ask GPT once because the thing is that uh it's not retrieving those values. It's actually treating them like one. This should work. It won't work. Uh I guess I have to run a query over here. then it would work. So this is this now. Then copy the JSON text provider and paste into Paste the JSON directly. Copy the JSON text you provided on Excel and paste into A1. Go to data from table ranges transform bar. Okay, let's do one thing.",
  "ranges transform bar. Okay, let's do one thing. It's not going to work. Uh this um the thing is guys, the thing is that usually Excel expects you to give JSON in this format. Okay. So if this is your uh if this is your JSON, it it expects you to give it like this. Okay. Now there should be the values of data. It's it's expecting the data to be like this. But the thing is that our data is not like that. Okay. So, uh that's one thing that you have to remember. If you don't have the data in this",
  "to remember. If you don't have the data in this format, then it perhaps will create some problems. Okay. Just like it's creating for me. I can just parse through this entire thing in uh Python and then create it. But that would be much time consuming. So, we can do one thing. uh we can create another uh JSON file with the appropriate schema we are looking for or else we can uh do this as well. Let me try this once and then check if it works or not. Yeah, just remove everything from here. Copy",
  "not. Yeah, just remove everything from here. Copy and close this discard. Paste it right here. Then no wrapping next. Now it's asking to Excel based data from table ranges table range. Okay. And here it is. My table has headers. Uh I don't think so. See? Okay. And then uh transform sect transform pass JSON. Transform and pass parse JSON. It's getting all right. Uh let's do one thing instead of putting our head into it. Let's do one thing. Uh let's give it the expected JSON schema it's asking us",
  "give it the expected JSON schema it's asking us for. Okay. And uh let it be like 10 and should be like this and I will make it like this. Yeah, absolutely. And now let's close this card. Uh, this saved delete this one. Okay, so my new file is saved. Let's go over here and uh, okay, it was data. Get data from file from JSON again. This quotation import should work hopefully. Yeah, it works. Okay. uh to table. Okay. Uh let's see what's it given us. It's given us like this. Uh okay. Let's do one",
  "It's given us like this. Uh okay. Let's do one thing. Let's ask [Music] Let's see if I can generate some data myself for Excel to be able to load it. So uh [Music] this well let's do one thing uh because all these approaches are not working uh it's I guess it's better to just uh it is sort back to searching just uh using an online tool to do the stuff for us. Okay. So it would be convert. So Tanya we are doing what you suggested it's not working that because yeah Excel is a really robust tool",
  "that because yeah Excel is a really robust tool but sometimes it backstabs okay so just like it backstab so I would be doing to JSON to Excel okay by the way most of the times this uh opening up this file uh using data and then get data from. It usually works but uh now for some time it's not working so I don't want to waste waste all of our time over here trying to figure it out. So let's just convert it using this two. So this is done. Yeah, it's done. And copy and sun time and then do is",
  "it's done. And copy and sun time and then do is convert uh it sheet. Yeah, let's convert up and report on it. Okay. All right. So, uh this is able to work and uh yeah, now we can see that we have two columns and uh these two columns uh they have the data that we were expecting them to be. So, we have about 110,000 rows. And now to calculate the correlation between these two columns, what we have to do, it's pretty simple. It's just I guess it was coral function. Yeah, it's a coral function and",
  "coral function. Yeah, it's a coral function and uh this just pass these two arrays in this coral function just like this and close it and it will give you this particular value. So let's just check if this is the exact value which I have filled in my summation or not. So that's the exact value. It's minus0.914 and here it is -0.91417 as well. Okay. So this is how you can actually calculate the correlation and uh get the answers. Any questions over here? Anyone? Anyone any questions or should we",
  "here? Anyone? Anyone any questions or should we move ahead? Okay, I guess we should move ahead. So the next question is regression with Excel. All right. So for this I guess I have plenty of data to work with. Let me have a look at my data sets. Uh let me check uh or perhaps we can use uh famous data uh set which is renowned for uh you know regression. So let's just check for linear regression. data sets. Okay, let's check uh this one. Okay, here it is. Car price data set. And what all do we",
  "it is. Car price data set. And what all do we have? So by the way guys if you don't know and that would be pretty unusual but if you don't know this is the Kaggle website uh which contains the which like it's kind of uh haven for those who are working in ML uh who those who are working with ML machine learning models deep learning models AI models okay so there are multiple data sets present over here there are compet regularly they are compet they are hosting competitions moreover the MLB",
  "they are hosting competitions moreover the MLB project is a comp is a Kaggle competition which you have to complete. Okay. So you can deploy your models, you can create code files, you can also learn from Kaggle as well. So that's uh I guess a very new feature which they have added. I haven't checked it in a long time. Okay. So let's check our data. Uh okay. So it contains multiple uh these types of things. What we can do is okay I just need a simple linear regression with nothing much fancy",
  "simple linear regression with nothing much fancy because uh when we are working with linear regression we are expecting numerical features rather than uh uh rather than categorical features. Okay. So it's giving me housing. So let's just see. Uh okay. So it's load post. Uh all right. So what I will do is we get back to Python and I hope I have SQL installed. Okay. Question. Go here. Print. printing it. So, let's check the TF once. Okay. Has been removed from cycle one. Wow. Okay. Uh let's just",
  "removed from cycle one. Wow. Okay. Uh let's just download a really simple data set. Open data sets. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me please. Yeah. How do we create Jupiter file inside VS Code? That's pretty simple. Just uh create a new file and give it a name. Let's say Telvin. I'm giving it Oh, just and IPv create a Jupyter notebook. Okay. And it will work. Uh it will download everything of its own. No, it won't download everything. You have to set the kernel for that. For example, if you are using an",
  "kernel for that. For example, if you are using an virtual environment, then you have to select the virtual environment for this kernel. So just click over there this select kernel and then you can select the virtual environment. So over here I'm using the this virtual env that's why it's string otherwise if you just click over just select another kernel you can select a different the global python environment as well. Okay fine. These are Yeah. So these are multiple env. Okay. I was familiar",
  "So these are multiple env. Okay. I was familiar with call at that just yeah so for uh you know for uh this is uh wish market data system the thing is that I don't want to show you a really complex linear regression data set because you know in linear regression basically we have multiple categorical variables as So categorical variable means uh textual data as well. So I don't want to show you that because that would just complex make things much complex. So I'm just searching for a really",
  "much complex. So I'm just searching for a really simple data set or what we can do is we can just uh uh data iris. Oh yeah exactly Iris data. Yeah. But that's classification. Yeah. That's that's classification. That's classification. Yeah. Yeah. I guess on Kaggle there was a solved uh not linear regression a solved uh I guess I'm sign in as well. So there is a really famous linear regression data set present on kegle which is about uh housing prices. Titanic also it's there right that's Titanic",
  "Titanic also it's there right that's Titanic also it's there. But Titanic is again classification if the person survived or not. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is a traffic sign out sign in with Google [Music] ID. That's I actually solved uh a competition participated in the competition and uh it had all that uh was a really good uh linear regression data set that's what I'm searching for but again I'm not able to what we can do is uh we can create our own data set okay so yeah we can create",
  "our own data set okay so yeah we can create our own data set and try to run the okay so it's node diabetes Is that present? And tell are you sure this is not a classification? Yeah. Yeah. Ordinary list square only it's okay. Okay. I first only it's scal. Okay. Okay, this looks good. This looks very good. Dot data frame. All right, so this looks absolutely good. And uh what we're looking for, we also want a target variable. Where is the target? Okay, so here's the target. and uh the target this",
  "so here's the target. and uh the target this okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to merge them and uh okay this data and then data and uh target yeah now let's see the data absolutely perfect Now I'll export it to as CSV and then I will show you this in Excel. So this is the spelling of diabetes, right? Not at all diabetes data. Yes, we all right. So we have done this and uh where is it? Diabetes saved it. So it's okay. Okay. So I should have put index is equal to none is equal to false.",
  "put index is equal to none is equal to false. Okay. So this is the data set. And now how can you perform linear regression on this data set? Okay. So what is linear regression? Can anyone just tell me what do you understand by the regression or any kind of regression? Anyone? What do you understand about linear regression or regression in general? Anyone who has taken MLP before TDS? Anyone? MLP MLF. So that was I guess MLFl is a prerequisite of TDS. So you guys pretty much know about",
  "of TDS. So you guys pretty much know about regression even if you have forward and you have few memories of that you can speak upon. I have currently taken MLP. Uh-huh. Yeah. So linear regression something we have to calculate the value which is and predict the target value whether it's correctly. So we have to predict the target testing the weights. Yeah. So we have to do that and what I'm going to do is I'm going to segregate this data into test and train. So that would be much that will just",
  "and train. So that would be much that will just add a layer of complexity and fun to so it paste it. All right. Let's copy the headers as well. By the way guys, are you able to understand what I'm doing over here or is it just going over your heads? All right. So that's pretty good. You're able to understand even and uh anytime you have any kind of error any kind of doubts just let me know. Okay. So uh this is our training data and this is our testing data. So what's the concept behind training",
  "data. So what's the concept behind training and testing? It's nothing but uh we are going to actually we are going to train our regression model on test train and then we are going to test our model on the regression on the trained model. All right. So for regression task you need to have uh a kind of what is called a plug-in a data analytics plug-in. So uh I guess I will provide you the link to download this plug-in but uh you can just go to Google and uh just search for data analysis plug-in",
  "and uh just search for data analysis plug-in for Excel and you can simply download it from okay. Okay guys, so what we're going to do is uh by the way, is this level of magnification in Excel enough or should I magnify it even more? Okay, I'll just magnify. That's fine. Okay, so over here you can see that I have two extensions for analytics. So one is solver and other is data analytics analysis. So uh you guys can download this extension. It's not an extension, it's a plug-in. You guys can",
  "not an extension, it's a plug-in. You guys can download this plug-in from the uh from internet and it can work like you can perform multiple analysis tasks using this. Okay. So I'll be performing the regression task. So it's pretty simple. Just click on data analysis. Then you can see that you have been given multiple uh options to choose from and one of them is regression. Okay. And by the way, if you guys remember something from stats too, then you might remember this. T stat test, set test,",
  "you might remember this. T stat test, set test, uh rank, percentile, moving averages, right? F test. So all these things belong to uh stats too and uh you can just play along with these as well if you remember. Okay. So just go to regression, click okay. And it's asking me for the X range and the Y range. By the way, can anyone tell me what's an x range and what's the y range and what's the significance of these two arrays? Anyone? Anyone? Okay. So thus the meaning behind these uh x and y",
  "Okay. So thus the meaning behind these uh x and y ranges is that x range contains all the independent variables in your data and y range is the dependent variable. So I won't be getting into much depth about what's independent and what's dependent because that's something you uh you can learn from the internet. Okay. uh but the main concept is that X the model will be training on the X ranges on the independent features to predict the Y range which is the target variable. Okay. So this is how",
  "is the target variable. Okay. So this is how it works. Now uh because I have the labels the names of the columns as well. So I will be selecting this labels option. Okay. And uh you have to check nothing. Okay. Just click on okay. All right. So it has given you something. I will just rename the sheet to analysis. Okay. So this has given you some kind of outputs and you can see what what is okay. So this is the regression output summary output and you can see that we have got multiple",
  "output and you can see that we have got multiple statistics. So I will just quickly go over what these statistics really mean. So R square what does R square mean? Can anyone just tell me what does R square mean? You guys have been really quiet this meeting I would say and uh just go just go ahead and speak something just interact with me because it's like just I'm teaching uh an empty class at the moment. Just try and interact with me. I also make me feel that I'm part of a class. I'm teaching",
  "me feel that I'm part of a class. I'm teaching a class, not just empty benches. Anyone? What's R square? Anyone with the slightest clue? So, it will tell how the data is fitted. Exactly. Exactly. That's a really good uh analogy. So R square is basically a measure of how well your data has been fit on your data set. How how well your model has been fit on your data set. Okay. So R square indicates that and you can see that so the range of R square is about from 0 to 1. Okay. But it's 0.15 0 51.",
  "is about from 0 to 1. Okay. But it's 0.15 0 51. So that means that the model isn't performing much well. But uh that's not the concern for this session. the model can perform anyhow. Okay. So, uh these are the other summary statistics you can see. By the way, if you haven't watched the this video uh on a TDS portal about regression in Excel, you can just go ahead and watch that. Uh the instructor over there have has explained all these different uh variables as well. But uh anyway, I will be",
  "uh variables as well. But uh anyway, I will be explaining you what does these means. So this coefficient is actually what we have what we have to uh multiply in our uh data to get the output. Okay. So I will just demonstrate it rather than speaking it to you. So this is my first uh this is my first data point which I want to predict from. Okay. So let's just say I didn't have this target. Okay. Let's say I don't have this target. I will just hide it. Okay. So this is the test data set. So the",
  "it. Okay. So this is the test data set. So the very reason behind a test data set is that you don't have this target value. So in Excel uh sorry in real regression we are trying to fit a model which would be able to predict the target. Right? And in test we won't have a target. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to predict that target for us. Okay. I've just hidden it. I don't even I myself don't know which target which what's the value of for this what what's the value of the target",
  "of for this what what's the value of the target for this particular row. Uh okay. So let's take a random row 12th. Okay. And head back over here and what I will do is so I will transform this. Okay. So this is my data point. Okay, it's just a data point, a data row. And I'm going to take these coefficients. Okay, so these are the coefficients we have to multiply with these values. Okay, and we have to add this intercept separately. Okay. So guys, are you able to understand what I'm getting? Do",
  "are you able to understand what I'm getting? Do you have any clue what I'm trying to say? Yeah. Y = MX + C. So, exactly. Y= MX plus C. So, if you guys uh have gone through the MLF and MLT courses, this must be just kind of a revision for you. So, if you guys know about this, just speak up. Don't be uh you know kind of don't hesitate from speaking up. Okay. and just make the class class much more lively because uh these sessions are going to be present on the YouTube uh on the YouTube channel of",
  "on the YouTube uh on the YouTube channel of TDS for a long time for the entire duration of this degree. Okay, perhaps it's decades or two decades. So let's say if someone is going to someone from two decades later is going to open up this. Okay, so let's watch a live session from 2025. Aha, let's give it a try. And what he sees is is that one teacher is just teaching and the entire class is just white. So he might he might get much he might get a bit dished. Okay. So just try to make the class",
  "a bit dished. Okay. So just try to make the class lively answer what I am whatever is on your mind and uh yeah so that's what I want. Okay. So by the way so these are our coefficients. Okay. These are my coefficients. Aha. Okay, these are my coefficients and this is my intercept. Now let me just put my intercept over here. Okay, so now what I have to do is I have to multiply these values and get the answers. So it's pretty simple. It's just multiply. These two values will get multiplied. These",
  "These two values will get multiplied. These two values will get multiplied. These two will get multiplied and then we have to get the sum of those multiples. Okay. So can anyone tell me what should I do to get what I'm looking for? It's basic Excel now. Nothing complicated. Nothing much complex. I forgot the formula exactly. It's like sum of what formula is. We can it was sum. Yeah. Some can you see that formula over here? Yeah. Some product. Yeah, that's the Yeah, we'll be using some product.",
  "that's the Yeah, we'll be using some product. Yeah. Okay. So, and we'll give the ranges and all x and y. Yeah, we are going to give the ranges and now it's going to work. Okay. So, this is the fi this is the u sum of the products. Fine. And the final step remaining is that we have to add this with the intercept. Okay. So this is the target prediction for this particular data point. Okay. So this is the target prediction for this particular data point. And let's check if we are right or not. If",
  "point. And let's check if we are right or not. If we have predated it correctly or not. Let's just check. So this was the actual value. So we have to check the 12th now. And let's check analysis. Let's put it over over here. This is the actual value. Actual uh target actual target actual. Okay, this is target actual and this is target prediction as and you can see that our prediction is way off. It's not that way off actually. uh we have crossed the 100 mark and we are at 16 but uh the actual",
  "the 100 mark and we are at 16 but uh the actual value was 183. Okay, that means the model is not performing well but uh this is how you can perform analysis and then this is how you can perform you can actually get make predictions. Okay. So any questions until now? Any questions guys? Because let me be honest if you are not asking questions and then that train sheet. Yeah. Once train sheet. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. This is the actual value or like predicted? This is the actual value. Okay. And",
  "predicted? This is the actual value. Okay. And prediction is based on the test, right? Yeah. Yeah. Predictions are being made on the test. Okay. You pasted here and it all came right. Yeah. I just uh removed these rows from the very last and pasted them over here. No, no, the target I'm asking that formula is correct or not. I'm just want to check. This formula is absolutely correct. But the thing is that it's not able to predict very well. Okay. No, you can I want to just check whether that",
  "No, you can I want to just check whether that test of in test sheet target one. Yeah. In test sheet target one. This one. Yeah. Just that's just number, right? Yeah, that's just a number. Yeah. What else did you think? No, no, no. I thought you copied and pasted the formula here and it just dragged it out. Uh, no, no, no. I just uh I just made those predictions over here. I just did it for this one data point which is this 12th row just for Yeah. By the way guys, any other questions or should",
  "By the way guys, any other questions or should we move ahead and let me tell you perhaps this will uh uh perhaps this kind of thing might come in the end term as well. Okay, perhaps we will ask you what's that uh what's the coefficient what's how you can make the predictions out of this. So this is one thing that can come in your end term and uh and then you might think okay so far was asking me to ask the question but I didn't at that point of time and now I'm struggle I'm going to lose the",
  "time and now I'm struggle I'm going to lose the box. So if you have a question just ask me or yeah any more questions or should you move sir? Yeah. So what is the importance of this tat? Okay. So this t stat if I am not wrong this is the statistics this is the uh uh this is the confidence value I guess of uh where our data set where of where this particular point stands on the distribution. Uh I'll be honest I'm not much good with statistics and uh the stat is something which I learned in stats",
  "uh the stat is something which I learned in stats too but I have forgotten. It has been about two years since then. So yeah, if uh you can just search for that and uh I uh I would say that uh these chat uh won't be something which might come in your inter. Yeah. So we can ask you how you can actually make predictions given a a particular data point and how you can actually make predictions and then we may give you the screenshot of this entire table and then ask you to okay you have been given",
  "and then ask you to okay you have been given this data point make some predictions kindly make what's so this can be there okay do we ask regarding the missing value in our table. Uh which one like we will give like few we will uh have remove that residual DF value from the table and we'll ask what is the residual DF you're asking for the degrees of freedom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Degrees of freedom like that question through I don't think I don't think we will be asking from degrees of freedom",
  "think we will be asking from degrees of freedom because that's DA course. So business analytics course deals with that and alias usually doesn't but uh our questions can come from like uh make some make make some predictions using these coefficients okay that that can that can be the kind of question will not be oh yeah I don't think that it it would be there okay so uh let's move ahead to the next question already it's we have passed the 1 hour mark Yeah. Where is it? Uh yeah, there it is. All",
  "mark Yeah. Where is it? Uh yeah, there it is. All right. So the next is forecasting with Excel. Okay. And uh for this we need uh we need a set we need a time series data set for this. And again I don't have a data set for this. So what we can do is uh so it's a basic formula. It's a for it's just a forecast. Okay. So we have been given this practical test. Okay. Thank you. We have been given this data set. Okay. So we have been given data sets over here as well. Haven't checked that. That would",
  "here as well. Haven't checked that. That would have saved a lot of time but all right. Okay. So this is a traffic data set and we have been given uh we have given multiple dates and then we have uh the information of vehicles. Okay. So what does time series data what does time series analysis uh sound to you? Uh what does time series analysis mean to anyone? So predictions with time. Exactly. So it's uh it's not actually predictions. I would it's much more like yeah we are going to forecasting",
  "much more like yeah we are going to forecasting uh okay so we are going to actually use time series to predict what's what's going to come next. Okay. So all these data these time data. So these are the dates and these are times. Okay. So you can see that we these are uh you know these are in the intervals of 1 hour and we have been given this time and then the number of cars which are present. So that's an entire data of uh 1,400 values and we're going to perform that fourth string. It's a",
  "we're going to perform that fourth string. It's a view only. I'll make a copy of it. Uh make Okay. So, let's run the forecast. Okay. So, it's asking me for uh uh Okay. So, it's asking this is for the this one. And uh okay, it's asking me for that as well. uh I guess I have okay so the value on the x to forecast on the value on the x-axis to forecast okay the data range representing the data matrix of dependent [Music] okay okay so this x actually is the test data set okay so it's the test value",
  "is the test data set okay so it's the test value we want to predict okay so let's just Okay. Uh guys, we have been given we have been given this data set and we have the data from uh so let's make it readable at least and I'll format it is uh convert to no I want to change the format of this. You can use as chart right that would be easier right? Uh we can use chart. Yeah, we can use that as well. But uh just a second. I will August and here should be two digits. That's how I like to look at",
  "be two digits. That's how I like to look at dates. Okay. So let's do one thing. Let's create a chart just like Telin suggested. Uh okay. And this will be insert then chart and yeah so this is the data set. So this is the chart and you can see that uh we can see that there is a kind of seasonality present over there. Can anyone spot that seasonality? Seasonality basically means a kind of pattern which we can observe in a course of time. So we can see that we have so we hit a peak and then we go",
  "see that we have so we hit a peak and then we go down. We hit a peak and then we go down and that two at the very center between these two wells. So it's like uh during from 8 to 7 from uh 8 to 22 of November something is happening over like first three days it's been picked and last three days it's been picked. uh can wait in each fourth night. First three days it's been picked and last three days. Yeah. Yeah. So we can see that it's going up down up. So a kind of seasonality is we present.",
  "down up. So a kind of seasonality is we present. All right. So you know plotting time series data always gives you a kind of sense where am I getting is there a kind of is there a seasonality there or not. So let's say if I had uh completely noisy data set with no no uh regular patterns present and just irregularity. So so that would mean that this data set has no uh so that means that this data set won't be able to get what I'm looking at. Okay. So that's one thing and uh but we can see that a",
  "So that's one thing and uh but we can see that a kind of pattern has emerged over there and uh let's leverage that pattern. Okay. So what I'm going to do is can you see this? We have our data till December 31st, 2015. Let's choose one thing. I'm not satisfied with this. I want to see the I want to see what can be the number of cars the traffic on uh let's say first from 1st of January 2016 to 15th of January 2016. Okay. So that's what I what I will do is I will uh add it over here. Fine. Now I",
  "do is I will uh add it over here. Fine. Now I will change the data. So it should be one should be 01 and then 1st of January 2016. Okay. So it's over here and uh okay let's do one thing. Let I will just make it over here or uh yeah we can do that also. That was perfect. Okay. So this is our data and we want to add the time as well. So the time would be uh zero see. Okay. So this is the time and uh let's make some. All right. So it's making them but it's not actually uh we have to increment them",
  "it's not actually uh we have to increment them by ours. So it will be like this one and let's see if it works. Yeah, it's working. And let's get a forecast for the entire day. And let's also get a forecast for 2nd of January as well. is giving us I no it's not us that's one thing uh this done and okay so we are going to forecast till 2nd of January till 4 a.m. Okay, let's forecast. So these are our forecasting uh values forecast values and our predictions right so now let's run the forecast",
  "predictions right so now let's run the forecast function so it's forecast and then what we have to do is select this one because I want to make the forecast for this and now next it's going to ask us for the X data. So what's X? This is the X data. Okay, I am going to freeze all the rows and columns. Next, what's the Y? It's the number of vehicles. I'm going to freeze them as well. Let's make a predictions. How did you freeze that? Uh, can you please repeat? Yeah. How did you freeze that? Both",
  "repeat? Yeah. How did you freeze that? Both rows and columns. Oh, it was pretty simple. Uh I just uh selected those values. I just selected it. Okay. And uh now what I will do is I will uh unit forecast then this value and then I'm going to select this. Okay. Okay. So, I just selected it by uh just go over there, press control, shift and down and then press F4. It will F4. So, if F4 doesn't work, just press function key and then F4. Yeah, that's another Okay, let's see. F4 and let's go. Okay,",
  "another Okay, let's see. F4 and let's go. Okay, so it's giving us some very very bizarre values. Uh that's not expected. Okay, let's just uh swap these positions once. Perhaps that's the error. Let's see. Okay, that was the error. Yeah, because y test y. Yeah, I guess that's what see. Yeah, it was data Y. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So, it was data Y. That's what that's why it was giving us those R values. Okay. So, it should be over here and uh it should be like this. Okay. This and done. All",
  "it should be like this. Okay. This and done. All right. So this is what uh it's predicting and it's predicting that it would be kind of constantly uh giving us 21. Okay. So uh let's just see what was the count on the last 15. Okay. So I guess uh this is how you will make those predictions. So uh it's pretty simple. The formula is pretty simple. just uh uh this x is the value which you want to predict for this y is the number of vehicles and then the x is the dates okay this is how you make",
  "then the x is the dates okay this is how you make those predictions okay and I'm not sure why is it giving me uh in this range of 21 I guess uh the data was not that uh in season okay so I guess the seasonality was really low the seasonality trend was really low that's why it's giving us is these constant values just you know just nudging the decimal pointers here and there. Okay. So that can be the reason and uh one more reason can be that uh perhaps if we change the value of uh the if we",
  "uh perhaps if we change the value of uh the if we change the year if we change the month from January to November perhaps then it will be giving us better value. Just let's just test it. Okay. Should be one because sometimes what happens is it will expect you to okay it's now it's range. Okay. Okay. So I don't think that it would change much. Okay. So this is how you make forecasting in Excel. No issue is that in December it's been increasing right? That's why it's taking that trend. Ah yeah in",
  "That's why it's taking that trend. Ah yeah in December I guess uh actually you can see that in November the let's check the mean for November. Okay, the mean for November would be around this uh 25 and 25. That's why it's giving us that uh can use a count if as well but just too lazy for that. Okay. So on this ending it's ending 7:21 721. So the mean 721 uh why is it formula average right? Okay. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Yeah, it's 20. So that's why perhaps it's giving me uh so I just changed",
  "why perhaps it's giving me uh so I just changed it. So that's okay. It's giving me values within uh 24 and then it's increasing. Okay. So the thing is what I can understand is actually it picked up the trend from November to December which was like in November the mean value is 20. Then in December the mean value will be around 20 as well and then it uh predicted the values till 21 from January. Now if I predict the values for February they're going we are going to see some increase in the",
  "going we are going to see some increase in the values. Okay. And now uh after February if you check for multiple uh multiple months in the very future let's say if you're going to just like we search we check for November it's going to give you a higher value because what this forecast has done is okay I'll be drawing over this screen now second so what does this forecast actually do is so uh let's say this is my uh actual data up till now it was like this you you guys are able to see my",
  "it was like this you you guys are able to see my annotation right just give me a thumbs up okay so uh this was the point where till where I had my data I had my actual data and the forecast has been trained up till now okay now what it will do is what it will do is it will pick that. Okay. So this is the place where we actually left. Now it will move my bar like this. It will just constantly increase like this. Okay. So that's why in January we are able to see a much more we are able to see 21",
  "are able to see a much more we are able to see 21 because that's much more uh closer to nove the mean value of November. That's the reason and that would be much more closer to December as well. But as we go to November 2020 2016 then we are able to see 24 values and then if you go to 2017 then perhaps you will see values crossing 30 as well. So that's how this forecast is actually picking up stuff which is uh not good but uh that's all we have. Okay. There are multiple other ways to get a much",
  "Okay. There are multiple other ways to get a much more uh better uh time series forecasting but uh that's all what we are dealing with in this current uh mod. Okay. So the next one is outlier deduction in Excel. So that's pretty simple. Uh where is it? COVID 19 data or perhaps you can do it on the uh this one as well. Okay. So this is the data which I performed the correlation uh coefficient on. So I'll be deleting these annotations. Have you guys by the way have you guys understood what I",
  "guys by the way have you guys understood what I tried to explain over here? No sir. You weren't able to understand. Okay. The thing is that uh uh okay the thing is that when forecast so the forecast is able to you know it's been trained over here it's going through all these so this is the let me just mark it so this is the train this is the train okay and this is the test values so what does this forecast function does And what I believe it it's doing is it's actually picking up. So it's",
  "it's doing is it's actually picking up. So it's picking up the trend from here. Okay. So it uh it was from here it was like uh about about 20 then it picked up from there and uh now it's so perhaps the uh the mean value of December would be around 20 21 then it picked up that and then it started increasing it. So in January it was 21. Okay. And then it started increasing it gradually by November 206 by November of 2016 it's going to give 24. Okay. Then perhaps by uh no let's say November of",
  "Okay. Then perhaps by uh no let's say November of 2020 20 uh 17 it will perhaps cross the 30 line as well. So it's like going in a linear trend now kind of. Okay. So this forecast function is actually I guess it's not much reliable but that's all we have really much is it understood? Yes sir. Okay. So let me just read these annotations. We are all okay. So now we have to deal with outliers. So guys what do you mean by outliers? What do you understand by outliers? anyone what do you understand",
  "by outliers? anyone what do you understand by outliers? Uh yeah so I know on the basis of percentile yeah please tell me what's outliers uh which are lower than 25% and higher than 75 percentile exactly so you are very close uh and uh I will just show you how you can get these outliers so the outliers let me just plot this and uh then perhaps you'll be able to understand what I'm getting at. So, uh I is there option for box plot box and disc? Yeah, here it is. Okay. So, none of the values are",
  "here it is. Okay. So, none of the values are outside the box. So, I guess I should download the data set which is present over here. Okay. So I'll download this uh system. So I'll uh file make a copy. All right. So our data has been loaded and uh insert column insert column right. Okay. So this is the data for new cases. Let's plot our box plot on this and let's check. So there are multiple uh missing values as well but uh let's just ignore that. So I'll be inserting a chart and it would be a",
  "So I'll be inserting a chart and it would be a box and whisker box and whisker. Yeah, here it is. Uh requires at least five columns but one was provided. Okay, let's copy it to our Excel. That's much better than special. Okay. So, I've copied the new UPS new cases data from there and now I'll be inserting a chart. The chart would be box absolute. So, this is a much better graph as compared to the previous one. So can you guys see Tanya what all points would you classify as I think above the",
  "points would you classify as I think above the line. Exactly. So above the line. So this line is actually the upper bound of this box plot and anything which is above the upper bound and lower than the lower bound is an outline. Okay. So uh now how you can calculate these upper and lower bound. So by the way this is this understood? How can you is this understood? How can you just interpret a box plot? Should I explain it one second? Anyone Monisha Nil Lima? Is it understood? Yes, understood.",
  "Nil Lima? Is it understood? Yes, understood. Okay. So, can you please tell me how can I calculate this upper bound for the box? So, which is above the line. Yeah, that's above the line. But uh you have any idea how can I uh calculate this upper bound for this box? So this line over here it's the upper bound. How can I calculate this? You can say that I don't know that's uh that's much appreciated. Yes. Don't know. Okay. Got it. So we'll be calculating the upper bound and the lower bounds. Okay.",
  "the upper bound and the lower bounds. Okay. And that's a very simple thing to do and how you can do it. It's uh firstly we'll be calculating the quartiles. Okay. So uh again this kind of question can come in the end term to uh perhaps calculate the quartile. So just be aware of that. Okay. So how you can calculate the quartiles? Simple. So I'll be calculating the first quartile. So for uh calculating the outliers it it's we just have to use the first and the third quartile. Okay. And how you",
  "first and the third quartile. Okay. And how you can calculate these quartiles? Uh simply simply use the quartile function. Okay. So I guess this is the one. Okay. This the quartile function and uh select this entire array preset using quart one. So I'll be using the first quartile. So I'll be then I'll be writing the quot the formula for the third quartile. All right, I'll freeze it now. Okay, just a second. Can anyone tell me how did I freeze this these all rows? I just told you guys just now.",
  "these all rows? I just told you guys just now. So control shift and plus F4. Okay. So, control shift and down arrow was for selecting them and for freezing was F4. F4. Okay. So, yeah, just simply press F4. Okay. That's good. And uh now set in the third quartile. So, these are the quartiles. So, what are quartiles? They're nothing but percentiles. Okay. So, now again you might ask what are what are percentiles? So, uh if I'm not wrong, percentiles are the point uh let's say if I'm going to",
  "are the point uh let's say if I'm going to calculate the so this quartile one is the 25th percentile and quartile 3 is the 75th percentile. Okay. So uh what are these percentiles mean? Percentile means that uh 25th percentile means that have let's say you are sitting in an exam okay and you scored 974 marks okay so a have so and you have been told that you got a percentile of 25 so that means that 25% of students who gave the exam have scored less than you okay so that's the meaning of",
  "less than you okay so that's the meaning of percentile if amount. Okay. So, uh and the same stands for the 75th percentile. So, if you are uh having this particular score, this gigantic score, if you're having this, then that means that you have a percentile of 75. Okay. So, this is how this is the meaning of so that means that you your marks are more than 75% of people. So let's say you guys are you guys must have heard this whenever uh the entire J advance and J means row starts up that I",
  "entire J advance and J means row starts up that I have got a percentile of that a person got a percentile of 90 99 let's say so n having a percentile of 99 means that he scored more than 99% of people who appeared for the exam okay that's the meaning of percentile okay so we have calculated our quartiles and What next we have to do? We have to calculate the interquartile which is this IQR and that's nothing but the difference between these two. Okay, that's nothing but the difference between",
  "Okay, that's nothing but the difference between the quartile 3 Q3 minus Q1. Okay. Next we have to calculate the upper and the lower bounds lower bound and upper bound. All right. So these are the upper bound and these are lower bounds. How you can calculate the upper and the lower bounds. For that we also have a formula. Okay. And uh that's again pretty simple. I'll show you uh it's the formula is so I'll be writing it over. The formula is Q1 minus IQR into 1.5. Yes. Yeah. So Tanya or anyone",
  "minus IQR into 1.5. Yes. Yeah. So Tanya or anyone else tell me how can I make this happen? Tanya, can you go ahead? Um I can compute this. Sir fix the value of Q1. We will just write the formula in Excel. Nothing else. Exactly. I want to write the formula in Excel. But how just tell me I'm a newbie. I am a entire newbie and I don't know what please guide me. [Music] Yeah. E3 equal to E3. E3. Uh, okay. E3. Yeah. E E2, sir. Sorry. E2. E2. Okay. E2 minus uh I uh this one is D5. Yes. D5 multiplied",
  "minus uh I uh this one is D5. Yes. D5 multiplied by 1.5. Exactly. That's what we Yeah. And uh for the upper bound the formula is quite simple. So Tanya, would you like to would you like to tell the class the formula? It's pretty similar to the lower formula. Yes. So Q3 Q3 I'm just guessing. So plus IQR into 1.5 plus IQR into 1.5. Exactly. That's the exact formula. Okay. And uh it's exactly the same thing that we have to do which is I'll just copy this. I won't write the formula once again. And",
  "this. I won't write the formula once again. And it's plus E3. So this is the upper one. This is the lower bound and this is the upper bound. Now any data value any data value which is above upper bound and lower than the lower bound is an outlier straight away out. Okay. So can anyone tell me Rojo you just answered uh in the chat box so that's really good and your answer was also correct right. So can anyone tell me what formula should I write over here to get the get those values? I just want",
  "here to get the get those values? I just want uh let's see if this 85,171 if this is an outlier I want a one and if it is not an outlier I just want a zero. Can anyone tell me how can I do this? Is number of if condition. Uh-huh. Is number and then if condition we can use is number and then if condition. Yeah. Why do we want to use is number? Yeah. Uh so that we can get the value 01. Uh but then this number will give you if that particular number is a number or not. But as we can see that all",
  "is a number or not. But as we can see that all these values are numbers. Okay. Why would I use this number directly also if we can use we can directly use an if. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So if and then we have to give the logical test and for that it's pretty simple. Click over here because we want to test this one. Okay, we want to test A1. Is it above upper bound? Okay, let's just freeze the upper bound again. I just pressed F4 and it just freezed all the rows and the columns. Okay, is it above",
  "all the rows and the columns. Okay, is it above the upper bound? Okay. So it's asking me so as you can see that the syntax of if it's value if true and value if false. Okay. So it's like this. So this is value if true. Okay. Just so it's value if true and value if false. Okay. So if it is true that this is above that then you should give a one. Otherwise I will run another if statement which will be a1 is it less than the lower bound. Let's check and freeze this this one as well. And if this is",
  "and freeze this this one as well. And if this is true then I will give a one else as okay this should let's check and uh I'll apply a filter for that I will give some values. A and this is uh out let's filter and I want to see all the outcomes. So these values these uh 247 242 values are the outcomes and this is how you actually detect these outliers in Excel. Okay. Uh it's exactly the same in Python as well. Okay. It's exactly the same in Python and that's how you can do in Python as well.",
  "and that's how you can do in Python as well. Okay. Any doubts or should we move ahead? So in other in another if condition you have given one. So can you explain this? Yeah, I can explain this entire formula. So the thing is that uh in this formula what I'm doing? So can you guys see the syntax of if the syntax of if? Yeah, I'll delete this annotation. So can you guys see this syntax of it? It's asking me to give the logical test then the value if true and then the value if false. Okay, it's",
  "if true and then the value if false. Okay, it's straightforward. So uh first one is we are firstly checking if this a2 is greater than the upper bound or not because if it is greater than the upper one then the then it's a outlier right so if it is true then you should definitely give a one okay if it is not true then we don't know that if it is lower than the upper bound lower than the lower bound or not right Is that part understood? Because if it is not greater than the upper bound then we",
  "if it is not greater than the upper bound then we have no shortity if it is lower than the lower bound as well. Isn't it? And in the similar way if it is we we don't have this shortity then we will run another if condition and over here we are checking if a2 is less than the lower bound or not. Okay. If it is less than the lower bound then surely it is it is less than the upper bound. But if it is okay so it's uh it surely is it's less than the upper bound but it's also less than the lower",
  "the upper bound but it's also less than the lower bound. That means it's an outlier. Okay. So for outlier uh yeah so if it is an outlier we will just give a one. Okay. So if an so outliers so basically out what are outliers? Outlier should be uh it should be uh greater than it should be either greater than the upper bound or lower than the lower bound. Okay. So this is how you calculate that. Okay, any questions? Should we move ahead guys? Any questions? Next is Python and Panda is one of my",
  "questions? Next is Python and Panda is one of my favorite languages. So if you don't have any questions, we can move ahead. All right. So, let's move ahead with Python. So, uh okay. So, let's move ahead with Python. And uh yeah, by the way, let's just have a look at the questions in our uh in our C4 ones. just marked its marks. Let me have a Okay. So this is my assignment six and uh uh so what we will do over here is that uh that's pretty simple. This first question is pretty simple and uh you",
  "This first question is pretty simple and uh you just have to calculate the pear and correl correlation coefficient. Okay, that's pretty doable. Next question is s uh the exactly same one. You have to calculate the pear and correlation coefficient. You can do this entire thing in excel or python that's up to you. Okay. Uh next is calculating the uh predictions. Okay. So here we have to perform the predictions and this might uh Okay. So do you guys uh want me to take this part or not this uh",
  "guys uh want me to take this part or not this uh regulation part or you want to give it a try yourself? Let's do one thing. You guys can give this question a try yourself. Uh Okay. So yeah, so let's uh uh let's do one thing. You guys can give this question a try and uh it's just basic uh regression just like we did right now using that regression package. Okay. So one thing which I can demonstrate how you can do regression in Python. Okay. So this must be something that uh you guys might not",
  "this must be something that uh you guys might not know how to do. Okay. So let's uh okay so this is the diabetes data set. Okay so I'll be demonstrating how you can make those exact predictions in the load diabetes data set. All right so uh this is the data set and uh let me see it's done and uh yeah let's have a look. So this is our entire data set and we have the target variable present over here right. So what we have to do is I will create separate variables for the independent variables",
  "separate variables for the independent variables and the dependent variables. Okay. So the what are the independent variables? Can anyone tell me what are independent variables? Anyone what are the independent variables? They are actually features. Yeah, they're features but all of these are features as well. So what are the independent variables and what is the dependent variable? The thing is that the dependent variable and the so the dependent variable is the one we are trying to predict.",
  "variable is the one we are trying to predict. Okay. So target is the feature we are trying to predict. Okay. So you guys must be thinking that target has is already given to us. Then why are we trying to predict? Okay, the thing is that let's say you have been given so let's say a patient comes to you and he has this these particular uh these particular uh data values. So let's just see that if we have the names of these features as well or not. I guess we will have the names of the features.",
  "I guess we will have the names of the features. So uh we have a target. Do we have feature names? Uh let's one do one thing. Let's uh keys. Let's see. Yeah, we have a feature names. So uh this is the data. Uh this is the data and uh this is these are the columns calls. It's feature names. Okay. So, let's load diabetes feature names like this. All right. And then data dot columns is equal to uh I hope this works. Let's check for data. Ah yeah, here we are. Okay. So these are the parameters on",
  "here we are. Okay. So these are the parameters on which a person is been person has been tested upon. Okay. So all these uh values are the data for a particular person and then we are checking that uh perhaps the level of diabetes this person might have. Okay. So let's just say that I have this entire data set and let's say a new person comes to me with some new parameters some new values for these parameters. Now I have to predict if this person has which which uh what is the level of diabetes",
  "has which which uh what is the level of diabetes this person. So for that we are building this model. Okay. So how you can build a linear regression model in Python? I'll be showing this. Okay. So this is the data set. All right. So let's have a look. Uh so firstly I will be se segregating my data into X and Y. Okay. So this X is the independent variables and the Y are the dependent. All right. So for this uh we will this okay uh it's S1 S3 and we also want S4. Then we want S5 and X is S5. So",
  "we also want S4. Then we want S5 and X is S5. So coding is suggesting me a lot. All right. So this is done. So these are the two uh first thing first I should all right this part much more better for so this is how I have uh partitioned my data. So I have one I have this entire column segregated out from my data set and uh the entire data set has been stored in this X variable except the target. Okay. Okay. So let's just check the X. So it has everything except the target and uh the Y is simply",
  "except the target and uh the Y is simply the target. Okay. So that's done. Now what we have now what we have to do is we have to run a train test net. Okay. So uh yeah let's run a train test split. So what is this train test split used for? So this in this entire data set we don't have any test value. Okay. So I just like I just told you that uh perhaps a new person comes to us with uh some new parameters we and then we have to make some prediction. Now we don't have that particular new person",
  "Now we don't have that particular new person coming up to us right now. Okay. And we have to test our model as well. So that's why we split our data set into two parts which are training sets is a training set. Okay. So the training set contains the X train and the Y train and the X test and Y test are the testing sets. Okay. So this is uh let's run it and from has been loaded. Let's check it's running. Okay, let's see. Okay, so this is the X train and it has been randomly selected. By the way,",
  "and it has been randomly selected. By the way, guys, is do you guys have any doubts until this? Any doubts or should I move ahead with the model building part? Okay, let's move ahead. By the way, I should I should have skipped this value as well. Uh but let's just go ahead. Okay, so I'll be showing you the entire model building part and the uh of the data set. This is how you So is is week six is is week six or only like what we did in ML MLB MLB MLP MLP it's not entirely what we did in MLB but",
  "MLP MLP it's not entirely what we did in MLB but it's more about data analysis okay and one part of that is regression okay uh we have we have taught you guys how to do regression in Excel and now I'm teaching you how to do it in pandas in Python as well okay so I don't think that uh week six contains anything about uh uh anything about doing this these regression in uh Python but uh I just want to show you guys how you can do it in Python okay because the thing is that in sometimes let's say",
  "because the thing is that in sometimes let's say you have been given a data set and uh it's about let's say one lakh it has one lakh rows and you have been told to perform some kind of uh regression task on that and then uh I'm telling you guys that if you're trying to run a regression task on in Excel with one lakh rows it's going to hang and it's going to hang very bad. Okay. So for that you should always use Python. Okay. So uh just make a train test split. Let's see. So this is my X train",
  "test split. Let's see. So this is my X train and then we have let's take test as well. This test. So now the only part remains is that of creating that model. So model creation. Okay. So for that we just have to import this stuff which is from sklearn dot linear model. Import uh linear regression. That's it. Okay. To import linear regression and then we have the model of linear regression. Okay. It's suggesting us everything. So this is how you are actually going to train the model. So that's",
  "are actually going to train the model. So that's it. Okay. So machine learning is this. So machine learning uh in Python is this much only. Uh it's just importing the library from skarn and then just fitting the model on X train and Y. Okay. Now the part of predictions it's nothing but model predict X test and it's going to predict everything. Okay. So these are the predictions which it has made. One thing that you can do is you can check the score. Let's check the score and uh uh okay I have",
  "Let's check the score and uh uh okay I have to pass the Y test that is a score. So what is the score? So just like in Excel we just saw that uh we had this uh R square value. So exactly like that in panda is in Python you can how you can get the R square value using the score function. Okay. So it will give you the R square value and uh this this is telling me that uh this model is not that good at predicting things but uh yeah that's all we can do much more optimization in the uh model. We can",
  "do much more optimization in the uh model. We can add few hyperparameters as well but that's not the agenda for this uh session. Okay. So this is how you can actually do actually create a model uh can do regression task in Python. Okay. So uh yeah that was it and uh uh okay let's back to the assignment ones. Okay. So, uh again this is the part where you have to apply the outlier detection which I just told you the IQR rule and 0.5. Okay. So, here we're using the 0.5 multiplier instead of 1.5.",
  "we're using the 0.5 multiplier instead of 1.5. Okay. And here you have to find the outliers in the data set. You can use Excel for that and you can use P and for that as well. That's pretty uh something which you can do. And uh what else is remaining? Uh okay. So using the have assign package you have to calculate the distance from this command to this. Okay. So guys do you have any doubts in this entire assignment and you might want to ask us now any doubts from this assignment that you might",
  "any doubts from this assignment that you might want to clarify and or anything that you might want to clarify on how I should approach this problem. Okay, I guess then uh uh Janj would you like to take over now or you can stop the session? Okay. Okay guys, we have hit uh okay okay so guys uh it's 7 and uh yeah we should stop this session now uh the only part which is remaining is this uh hugest part yeah this is part uh just a All right guys, uh that's it for today's lecture, today's live",
  "uh that's it for today's lecture, today's live session sorry and uh we'll be discussing the rest of the methods of data extraction and data analysis all these uh SQL DB and spatial and uh visualization as well also the networks library as well uh in the next lecture now okay next live session. So that was it and thank you for joining. Bye guys. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you sir. Bye.",

  "e e e evening audience uh good evening sir so uh what how's uh your progress going uh sir it's going pretty well I mean there was there are a few parts in week six that I've been I'm being stuck in but how through research and all I'm able to clarify all that sir okay what specifically weeks six you're stuck with sir to be exact I'll have to open my notes for that sir just a second okay hey good evening [Music] R he has connection problem [Music] hey St hello AIT hello sir how are you guys",
  "hey St hello AIT hello sir how are you guys progressing on Project two and other things yeah go ahead delin did you discuss with the on the meeting regarding that SC uh yeah so we um we uh did uh raise the issue of the scores he said the scores are going to be pushed today it wasn't pushed yesterday so can you just check and see on your dashboard what score you have received I checked now it was the same one it did not increase oh it did not change it hasn't gone to seven operation okay I'll um",
  "it hasn't gone to seven operation okay I'll um I'll just send a quick note to JK then just that and one more thing about the project part I tried to deploy inversal okay just I started with two to three questions so I fa One issues that we have to handle our files SL while processing so in I am not able to upload the file and hand report so when you say handle the file you're talking about sending a file into the endpoint is it yeah sending the file into L part and processing it okay so uh one",
  "file into L part and processing it okay so uh one thing is the file itself might not be sent as OPP post through the API what will happen is uh there may be uh there may be a link I would suspect because I don't think files will be sent to the API call itself I confused on that part also I have seen like blob storage based files but still I not able to get how the file handling will be there to test that one I tried to call from my own system having a file on my current Drive yeah current",
  "having a file on my current Drive yeah current folder and try to get that post request but it's not fetching it's giving internal error only okay but for Json based questions it's giving correctly response because it's right yeah I mean there's no there's no binary upload going on yeah so file handling B questions it's facing the issue due to this one so I need a Clarity on that how we can do just make notes for this CU then I can discuss it with an as well tellin can you just uh give me your I",
  "an as well tellin can you just uh give me your I have it here me it's 22 f20064 right yeah yeah yeah so as far as the task is concerned right uh for whatever GA it is there are um there are two aspects to file handling one is they will just send you they won't send you the actual file but in the request itself uh they might uh send you the link of where to pick the file up from so then what happens is uh your endpoint uh processes it in a function in other words it doesn't um get the file",
  "in other words it doesn't um get the file through the endpoint rather it uses a function within the application itself your application to fetch the file from somewhere like from a GitHub repo for example yeah it's fine but to process a file we cannot use GitHub itself right we have to process it in background right I'm not sure I understood question I am just saying like if you want to search like some keyword in the file we can get that content full of the text file and we can sub one that's",
  "full of the text file and we can sub one that's fine but if you want to extract a s file like extract F to something else and get the hash map of that for sh hash function then we have to extract the file without extracting we cannot do anything right yeah that's the point so processing wise we cannot do anything also I am facing issue in url also handling so URL also okay can you give me a specific example I'll make notes of the specific doubt yeah file handling is the same question which was",
  "yeah file handling is the same question which was asked in like TDS portal that itself is not working uh no project two example they have given right all right yeah I will that example is not I did that only I was facing issue that ah right yeah okay question download single that's G6 or something I don't [Music] yeah okay I'll uh yeah just clar yeah I'll just clarify to because at the end of I can tell you the exct number also yeah because he will he will create the valuation for it you see so",
  "he will create the valuation for it you see so I'll just clarify with him yeah how he want students to apprach 1.8 it's GA 1.8 right yeah till seven ID need eight it's been stuck I mean meanwhile meanwhile what I would suggest is continue working on the other um the other functions yeah don't uh just stay fixated on like it's multiple of seven functions we have like files handling only yeah after that we have one HTML handling we have to get the tax and all that also I tried it using llm but",
  "tax and all that also I tried it using llm but it's saying we cannot access your HTML page okay one second yeah sorry uh so the second question was specifically with regards to second question was with regards to GA one 11 11 11 yeah 11 is like CSS based let me do one thing let me share the screen also so that it's easy for everyone to see what's happening [Music] yeah B it becomes a very difficult conversation for others to follow this is the one okay so you're talking about question one yeah",
  "okay so you're talking about question one yeah no from first question we go first first first question will go so first question I have hardcoded answer here okay it's fine second question I harded on my own email it's based on email based question the um right okay here okay here's the uh question for you so what if the parameter we send is not your email then it will fa okay we can right the seure it's not defined it's all right they are told to solve the G question yeah so here parameters",
  "to solve the G question yeah so here parameters are not defined if that's the case then everything can be parameters right we have to have an okay email we can do for Json thing we can just replace the Json content and just search my email and replace that's fine I can do it okay anyway let me question see I think the questions will be parameterized okay it may be the G question but uh I suspect it might be parameterized now whether it's parameterized with your own that I'm not sure if it is",
  "with your own that I'm not sure if it is then you canamer then which and all will be changing parameter we cannot determine right that's pretty hard right that's why only I am thinking it whether email the only field it will parameterized or any other yeah so I mean so this is not difficult yeah what happens is you send a request in your function to this end point with whatever the parameters right the this the email will be say here it's 20 3 whatever um but when you send it uh the request",
  "3 whatever um but when you send it uh the request will come back with a response that response is what the answer to this question will be yeah that's the answer is so so you don't have to hard code it right no if it's correct but I hardc because I can ensure that it's correct answer right okay okay oh right you you just wanted to check but just yeah because testing is the first thing right we have to do sure sure just make a a running checklist of things you need to parameterize them because",
  "of things you need to parameterize them because other you might forget because there are so many function and email we can parameterize because exct using Rejects and get it out that's fine and npx I did direct you only okay um now one thing is I don't want to make this session completely about going question by question over no no I will questions 1.8 1.8 yeah because then this uh this will not yeah so this is so here the question was whether how will the file be sent and right now it looks",
  "how will the file be sent and right now it looks like in the example they given that they will send the file direct a small file directly into your verel H and you're saying you don't know how to process files within the veral function within veral because it's seress and request will change like the processing time will change every second it will be breaking so we cannot process it either okay anyone else have attempted this question eight have a solution uh yes sir so I did this question and",
  "a solution uh yes sir so I did this question and I got the answer as well but I haven't hosted it or um I haven't hosted it on uh versel I did it on Local Host I was able to get the answer for this question okay yeah I mean that of course Local Host you'll be able to and here's the other thing by the way that's a good point to make which is um the actual so let's look over here project two if we look at um the evaluation prerequisites uh GitHub repo GI up repo okay I'm just trying to see if",
  "repo GI up repo okay I'm just trying to see if there is a absolute necessity that it should be uh a versal endpoint and it says your application must expose an API input there is no there is no hard and fast rule it should be hosted by wor okay so that's just something to keep in mind no then if it's local how will we run full time we have to make out system um so that is the flip side right is there an is there an alternative to Vera that might be something worth no even if you have",
  "that might be something worth no even if you have alternative to our still it cannot be process a file in back and right because we have to have files uploaded right yeah I mean you need see you need some um infra to yeah something like blob or something we have to have where file is there and we will be doing something but still we have an infra to process yeah you'll need some infra to process it yeah yeah that's right that's where their blockages because in local testing it's fine because we",
  "because in local testing it's fine because we can do it in our current folder but when it goes to the next level it's difficult to understand um okay sir uh just a uh just a point I wanted to make so before uh yesterday's class I did try to upload some files some some of the zip files onto my versal application and I was able to do it and uh I executed the curl command uh whereas the file was being taken directly from the uh versal application itself I did not do it exactly for this question",
  "itself I did not do it exactly for this question but for some other questions I did try and I was able to do that okay so um that be interesting are you able to share your screen to show what you did um just a second sir okay so tellin then maybe there is a way to do it there is where because we have to push the file to our G and then post it that's yeah yeah g g is a a place where you can push push files right so that no we can do that's the issue here because versal app cannot be hosted again",
  "here because versal app cannot be hosted again and again like one time it can be hosted we cannot change that repo no no the repo no no no no the repo doesn't need to change that repo does not need to change see you can have more than one repo right one repo can just be a storage repo correct you basically use it as a storage medium so through versel you get the file and then you push the file onto a storage uh on G on a separate repo that is not connected to the repo for the project I mean",
  "not connected to the repo for the project I mean basically you need to store the file somewhere right to yeah we have to store the file somewhere and it should be available in verel as well that's the thing here uh yes sir so this I hope my screen is visible yeah just uh you can minimize your that uh yes so so these are the files that I uh uh pushed it to my GitHub repository and then I created the versal application I mean I linked my GitHub repository with this so every time I update my",
  "repository with this so every time I update my Repository automatically it gets uh it it automatically deploys the latest version so sure yeah that's normally how so that's how versal integration works with gab anyway when you push changes to it it automatically he runs the CL here the issue is that we can not push that file into the same GitHub report where theist been host that's the issue if you want to what she told is normally what we do for a Json file which we have to extract the correct",
  "a Json file which we have to extract the correct phrases or something okay all right anyway I've made a note of it um and um yeah and yeah yeah apart from file processing yeah this ising 11 yeah is my screen visible still or is it gone it's still it's still one this okay this is HTML like back and we have taxes yeah so here what what you can do is you can fetch this page itself right it's it it cannot be fetched right this page cannot be fetched is it it's just an URL right back and how will",
  "is it it's just an URL right back and how will mat uh I mean when you put a request to this you will get a response that looks something like this is not an AP right it's just a we page oh no I know it's not an API but what will happen is in your um in your response so what will happen is you'll get this right in your response this file will come in your response whatever these sections and everything HML you're telling yeah yeah the HTML will come right because this requires you to find all",
  "come right because this requires you to find all the divs right so it requires you to pass through the um if iamp so here right it uh this comes in your request right this structure hello this no that there there is no request itself that's the thing they have just that phrase that question alow they don't have anything HT so when you make a request to this end point yeah with your authentication cookie you don't get this you don't get this uh page is it no we cannot get that that's a b that's",
  "is it no we cannot get that that's a b that's that's just a get right it should it will just return 200 or something it will not return that HTML right just one point to add here so based on the parcel that is defined in the request uh library or httpx library that should provide you the entire HTML setup like if this is a URL moment you have the URL added in and then do a passing if the pass is done for Json you'll have a Json structure if HTML you will get the ENT HTML parer and uh the status",
  "you will get the ENT HTML parer and uh the status code 200 is basically the written code or the status alone but the content of the load itself is different right yeah yeah content needs to be given as in using some end point we have to get the full content of this page right that's my point so but the but the content will come when you send this endpoint to the uh send this endpoint to the uh request uh that you're making right in your python code when you're using beautiful soup and you put",
  "code when you're using beautiful soup and you put the request it will give you it will give you that um it will give you this this page itself is like email B right that's what ah so the reason for the email is that's why you need to send an authentication cookie with it uh if you remember I think in week two or week three there are some there are some cookies that you need to send with your request so there are some session yeah so there are some sessions where we covered that and effectively",
  "sessions where we covered that and effectively what happens is you send if I um if I look at this there are some cookies right application right here so yeah so there are some cookies that uh that are that come as part of the page uh so what you do is you you can send all the cookies back anyway um once you send the cookie with the request then you should be able to get the the exact page for your G okay yeah because it will load the page unless unless you're asking something else is that what",
  "unless you're asking something else is that what you're asking how do you get the Dom yeah Dom that HTML yeah so the Dom yeah so the Dom will only come once you send the authentication to along with the request to the page okay yeah yeah and uh question number uh 10 we have yeah here it's it's telling paste that J we can ex the Json that's fine we have to past that in this HTML page then click on hash button and get that hash yeah okay yeah so if we had yeah end point for this one it would be",
  "if we had yeah end point for this one it would be easier yeah so this is this is the end point right for this no that's that's just that's just the URL Endo means that will return some js on something I tried it you can and try using network tab also tried whether while pasting some Json whether it's giving some end point or not it's not you can copy the previous question Jon okay oh I see what you mean this is um this is probably running using JavaScript yeah it won't it won't actually go same",
  "yeah it won't it won't actually go same thing for that our assment page same thing is happening that's what everything is Javascript yeah I understood um here what I would suggest is you know this function that it's using here it's obviously doing a sh 256 so all you have to do is instead of actually trying to reach this end point right in your function just find the Sha 256 hash of the of the Json that's it but our local hash will not match right why will it not because they have some other",
  "why will it not because they have some other like to tell some other logic to generate this hashing that's what I saw in backet I tried looking local hashing but it's not work so you don't get the same value no it's different I tried multiple times it's [Music] different I think it's prob because so one thing one way to I will yeah yeah yeah so it's okay so it's using I think it's using this uh key in order to um generate the hash so it's using some sort of Preamble and then it's encryp JS it's",
  "sort of Preamble and then it's encryp JS it's having something encrypt JS is there that file is having some key using that it's been so you're saying it's not using this uh this particular no I think you inspect is not me sorry my inspect is not you're inting right I I can't quite here what you said can you say that again pleas sorry yeah I am able to see your page but inspect tab is not oh my inspect tab is not visible oh sorry sorry sorry I didn't I can interpret but okay okay people are",
  "I didn't I can interpret but okay okay people are raising their hands let them speak is that visible yeah okay so here uh see I think this is the key okay but in case you're not sure what this function does is you can always copy this oops you can always copy this and um stick it in [Music] um and um but this looks like the key to me okay that they're using yeah so I mean that's the key yeah that's some value yeah so what I would suggest is you just use this um use how this function is",
  "is you just use this um use how this function is constructed to create your hash has someone else has success with this uh particular question which is um G1 has anyone else success not n 110 it's 11 okay anyway uh if no one has tried it try um reconstructing that uh JavaScript in fact you can take that script itself put it in node I mean run it in node on your desktop and see if you get the same out okay yeah and that's yeah that works if not just if not just post on discour okay yeah someone",
  "if not just post on discour okay yeah someone was so Sans yeah 6 mon I don't uh sir it was uh me uh I had a question regarding uh verel and file so you discussed it earlier I was not able to catch exactly what point you were trying to convey what was not happening on versil okay so tn's concern was when a file is sent to the versal end point that he is not able to as far as I understood he's not able to open and unzip that file uh that has been sent to the versal end point uh sir so what I did",
  "sent to the versal end point uh sir so what I did itself yeah got it sir so I actually created a separate evaluate uh file and I put all the Cur commands and I was able to perform at least if not for all the questions one or two zip question I was able to get the output uh is that what you are uh talking about or no you have upload that F to your own right that's why you getting that answer okay what he's saying is this so say for example right uh this imagine this is the this is the uh post",
  "uh this imagine this is the this is the uh post that is made to the endpoint okay your endpoint okay yes sir so I'm sending the request to your endpoint your endpoint is up and running on versal and and I send you uh the question as well as this file this physical file will come in the post have you tried this is basically the question got it sir I tried it for versel I mean I tried it for local host but I haven't yet tried it on versel because uh I was not able to build the application after a",
  "I was not able to build the application after a certain point it exceeded the 250 MB for me so for now I stopped uh trying to do anything with ver itself okay I mean the thing with versel is you don't okay one thing you should try to so 256 MB is quite a lot okay don't use versel as a as a server I mean as in don't use it to uh do anything more than react to the endpoint itself um have a service running on some separate uh server is what I would suggest because I don't think you'll be able to",
  "suggest because I don't think you'll be able to host the entire application on your yes sir yeah it's got if we it will be breaking right every five or second it's been giving signals to itself I haven't so personally I have not tried pushing a file and processing it on there but uh no you cannot do it it's it's the key yeah but uh in terms of uh running the application veral is just supposed to be what how would I say it something that just reacts to the end point but all the processing will",
  "to the end point but all the processing will be done on how I Envision it is it will be done on some separate server somewhere it'll take the request send that request to a server that does the processing and then it receives a response back from that server and then it sends you back the answer which is what you're looking for all the answers you can process it on file but it should have that file in its local yeah yeah yeah this is for this particular issue you're talking about yeah yeah no",
  "issue you're talking about yeah yeah no in every everything we need a file in back then only has been reacting everything does not require a file right not all questions no no I I am telling ver itself and yeah this is the part and one more thing I can tell you question number 18 is there right 18 last question yeah yeah here skl Cory they are asking yeah so from where is that actual question H the actual question is this right this is the question so that will be the only question which will",
  "so that will be the only question which will be given what is the total sales of all the items um I mean the main thing is uh here the database is sitting on the um I think it's some somewhere in here on the TV Arjun has some question uh hi colon yeah yeah uh can we host it in Amazon AWS because they are giving uh like uh anywhere yeah yeah anywhere you can host it there's no restrictions on where you host it okay and instead of the domain name can we give the IPS uh yeah for you can yeah yeah",
  "can we give the IPS uh yeah for you can yeah yeah you can because uh see on Project to that's what I was telling earlier this is just an assumption right all we require is that your application op as an a public end okay okay because they giving three months free we can use it for the project yeah then Yeah Yeah by all means go ahead and use use it okay thanks I mean that would simplify a lot of the issues yeah it doesn't yeah I mean that's the main problem right most people are saying reversal",
  "problem right most people are saying reversal is very restricted this was just as an example your end point doesn't have to be vers it can be any anything that provides you an EMP you can even get a cheap Raspberry p and run it 24/7 it takes very little current also I think it takes something like five Watts or something less than a light bu okay okay thanks so yeah how many of you by the way just out of curiosity how many of you know what a Raspberry Pi is yeah I've used in some projects",
  "a Raspberry Pi is yeah I've used in some projects actually the minor projects we used this is yeah so yeah so Raspberry Pi is probably like the cheapest um personal computer that you can possibly buy right and it's actually very capable and it's very very cheap I think you can get a maybe say like a Raspberry Pi 3 and um it'll cost you uh what will it for these days 20 so about 2,000 Rupees you have a fully functioning computer I'm not saying go spend 2,000 Rupees to do this project but uh my",
  "spend 2,000 Rupees to do this project but uh my point is that um it is uh you can use it for a lot of things not just for being project it's a fully functioning uh I mean most people put Linux on it it's a fully functioning Linux system and you can do quite a lot with it and it's it's uh it's worthwhile Okay and like I said it consumes very little power about I think it's something like five wats of power when you compare a light bulb even an LED light bulb takes I think more energy than a",
  "LED light bulb takes I think more energy than a Raspberry p so and the size you can get raspberry pies that are as big as your finger right a fully functioning personal computer the size of a finger and um you can even run it using a battery so if you don't have uh if you have a lot of power Cuts in your place right you can have it attached to a battery and it will run on a battery that's how amazing it's called a Raspberry p in case you not but the pricee I told you that's for like a new",
  "but the pricee I told you that's for like a new raspberry pie right so there may be used ones out there but I usually find it very hard to believe that someone would sell a used Raspberry p because it's just it's such a fun device to be able to do so they use it a lot in education obviously because of how cheap it is um yeah I mean so just trying to yeah so this is uh this is an example this is how small it is um it's like really really tiny and this is this is the price of a brand new one this",
  "this is this is the price of a brand new one this comes with WiFi $5 so this is brand new comes with a Wi-Fi okay and um it even has um I think HDMI or USB port or whatever it is so very very super cheap um and then of course you can do all sorts iot work on it this is a bit more uh fully fledged machine again this is a size of a credit card okay comes with the 64-bit quad core processor wireless land Bluetooth I mean um it it has a HDMI port so you can connect it to a monitor and of course you",
  "you can connect it to a monitor and of course you can also build cases and stuff for it so you get full kits as well but yeah super cheap and it's a fully functioning computer right and you can do use it for a lot of experimentation and just education FS so yeah running something like this hardly takes any power you can have a fully functioning server that does does your project on that okay you don't have to worry about person that's just a sideline okay um right I think pres is on the call",
  "okay um right I think pres is on the call yes okay will you take over person any other questions uh yes sir I have a question I'm still trying to understand how the final uh evaluation will happen like uh as in we do have a public API end point and then from there uh where exactly will the request how exactly will the request be sent to the end point I understand that this is the format but where exactly would it be sent from so that would be sent from um are site right so this I mean more like",
  "from um are site right so this I mean more like application endpoint is something which you built and have it St like the evaluation can be done from our end like whatever we uh send it uh and so during your evaluation the evaluation from your side you will upload the file and you will uh check for that particular question I that's the ks um but I can reconfirm that again so generally when when it comes to let's say project one data gen we had a uh data gen uh script and we had all those",
  "had a uh data gen uh script and we had all those generated data right so here Endo so coming back to the question here the uh let's say correlation you have to find out correlation between two uh uh data sets uh the idea here is the file would be uh shared as a part parameter uh when we send it but I I'll reconfirm that I think that's the ideal way all we need is application can handle the logical uh uh deployment whereas with respect to file sharing it should be passed as a parameter that's",
  "sharing it should be passed as a parameter that's let's see IDE understood sir the why I'm asking is uh so we do build the uh entire code for all the 57 questions I just want to know like from my end how how do I uh try to simulate a similar uh environment in which it is actually being evaluated so that reason I asked no totally understood uh uh so right now I mean the uh we believe this is how it will be uh but uh we reconfirm that again once again we we'll have it in discourse post or we can",
  "we we'll have it in discourse post or we can confirm it again or uh email on what the specific uh evaluations got it sir thank you I mean just to clarify right yeah see to clarify how we'll evaluate is we will send a cur request like this right from our server or whichever machine we have it will contain the question and it will contain a file and then your server should respond backwards uh with this uh Json request uh sorry with this Json B the this this is what should come back to us uh Json",
  "this this is what should come back to us uh Json with the answer in quotes and then whatever the answer is supposed to give should come back here that's how we evaluate it if this matches what we expect then uh you you know you pass the test case and we'll send like four or five of these kind of requests random ones uh so the files will be shared as a hyperlink to download so something like that or I mean currently as it is shown on here it's an actual file upload that will come part of the",
  "an actual file upload that will come part of the post because these files are very tiny anyway they're not very large files so that's uh currently how the project two is structured okay okay the yeah yeah if the question requires a file 64 like MV 4 and 5 which was about like extract like grip the dash commands using it sorry telin I didn't quite understand you on my end they breaking up quite a lot so I don't know if it's my internet over G 4 or five we had a question where we'll be gripping",
  "or five we had a question where we'll be gripping out and finding which is which log file have the sing dates or something like yeah so those files were very big but we are not going to send very large files to test okay so that much B yeah yeah so the file size you don't worry because we will send very tiny files on so instead of sending for example a 64 megabyte file we may just send you some few KB file uh yes PR uh it is written that the response must be a Json object with a single text uh",
  "must be a Json object with a single text uh string field so in in few questions we have to uh the answer is a image so it will be a b 64 encoding string as the answer yeah yeah you would send back a Bas 64 enod okay and the project uh deadline is 31st March right yes I believe so uh because the a mail came in uh in the morning 10 yeah I do apologize for those mails those Mals are not actually sent by the TDS team okay it's sent by uh ad and admin have a calendar that they look at and they were",
  "have a calendar that they look at and they were not informed of the date change so they just as a matter of their Duty they send out reminders and U we did not update them with the information that uh dates have changed so that's why they send out that reminder just ignore that it's just a reminder from admin but uh this is the actual deadine okay for image what did you say I did not uh for image answers answer that requires a compressed image back you send it back as a base 64 encoded Ur I",
  "back you send it back as a base 64 encoded Ur I mean a base 64 encoded uh string okay okay yeah as in url itself you are telling to send so there's a I think there's a question where you have to compress an image right yeah no we have two questions one compress an image second one rearranged image G 5 10 last person yeah so anything that requires an image to be sent back or something like that right just uh we all we need is you can send it back to us as a base 64 and coded or as an URL itself",
  "to us as a base 64 and coded or as an URL itself we can send no URL don't send it as URL send it as a b because uh we specifically say send a single text string to you so for ga uh 3 the last question make the uh write a prompt to make the llm say yes so will that prompt uh be actually be we have to pass the prompt through an llm and then how will the evaluation I'll just stop you there we are not going to send that question hello yes sir yes sir yeah yeah we are not going to that's not going",
  "yeah yeah we are not going to that's not going to be a question so don't worry okay sir we are not using the question yeah that one question we are not going to send it as a request okay actually I had the answer okay uh that's well and good if you if you got it um no but AP we have that's only consider and for one of the questions we have uh a question based on Google Sheets so for that question uh should we make use of Google Sheets API which one is it no I think for Excel and uh Google",
  "one is it no I think for Excel and uh Google Sheets you need not uh want to simulate the or automate the Excel G sheets just solve the question using formula with python yeah okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely not yeah these things we don't expect you to actually use the sheets okay just just we want the answer that's all we can use numi also right directly uh you can use numi you can use whatever programming logic you want here okay so this question will be starting no paramet Ching uh",
  "question will be starting no paramet Ching uh that I I'm not sure uh whether it's static or if it's Dynamic then we have to use that Google Sheets right uh no no you don't have to use Google Sheets right I mean uh the main thing is uh maybe you could uh for example have um have the uh see the these things will be the same right sum array constraint sequence and all that oh that that would be same that's what static VAR numbers are fine but I'm asking that for question when you say Dynamic so",
  "asking that for question when you say Dynamic so the data would be randomized but uh when you say dynamic because the expectation is an answer so let's say it will be a math equation that will be uh requested if you see the array creation and then the final answer is going to be a numerical number so derive that number using python formula so that uh let's say if there's a new data random randomized data added in still it will populate the right answer using the python logic yeah data means",
  "answer using the python logic yeah data means you're telling just the numbers right not that word sequence or something uh yeah these commands won't change yeah yeah that's what the clity these commands change and one more question Kon like uh same as project one we can just use the llm to solve it everything no like the function create the own functions so of course of course I mean my advice is uh if you can collaborate with each other and just each one decide okay I'm going to work on this",
  "each one decide okay I'm going to work on this particular question and hardcore the answer also that's fine if certain questions are a little more tricky to hardcore just use the llm to solve it yeah uh answer for GA 4 question number six there are uh do we have to parameterize for two uh for both the topic as well as the number of points or just the topic only because in one place in that question uh it's highlighted in a different color but above the input box uh it's not highlighted in a",
  "above the input box uh it's not highlighted in a different color so yes sir for this question hacker Linux python uh that is parameterized uh what about the points sir is that also parameterized yeah this this number I think is parameterized this 52 okay sir yeah yeah because it's in pink right that that tells me that this is probably parameterized and this is also probably parameterized these tags does everyone have item and Link might want to have a look and see and um whether this keyword",
  "have a look and see and um whether this keyword hacker is parameter my suspicion is these four items are par depending on what is used as the can we get all the parameterized variables and is there anywh um it's really difficult because I am not able to understand which is the actually question itself it's too much of paragraphs uh so this question is um see there is an API okay the whole point of this question is to access this API and then you have to uh I think this is this is one question",
  "have to uh I think this is this is one question where giving the details of the API to the llm will actually help you answer the parameterized part of these question so that it can solve the question for that's just not just this question I'm asking generally uh like we are having lot bigger paragraphs okay actual task could be just a question but we are not able to understand what would be the evaluation script or some Evolution question itself which you be passing question what is the link to",
  "which you be passing question what is the link to latest F that's the question that yeah yeah that so what is that pretext is the necessary thing which we want right so these things you're talking about right yeah these will be um it I mean I suspect if if this was the question if it was me sending the request I most likely I would send this whole thing as the question because it gives you the whole context right yeah that's what so so I need to understand each every question is difficult to",
  "to understand each every question is difficult to understand some questions is it starts from a long paragraph then it's telling to find out this one project to itself is something I am not able to understand how it works it it's really difficult uh see I think this again the approach the whole idea behind project to what Anand wants is people to work together and solve parts of it and whoever is good at solving certain parts can solve those things and others can do the simpler ones the idea is",
  "and others can do the simpler ones the idea is to collaborate find people to work with and collaborate and get that's the whole goal of project yeah it's fine just yeah questions at least question list can we get the the the question list is this is the Gs are the question list right no no that they are having questions right last one is the question prev one like description of that question like yeah I mean you won't need all this okay it probably starts from your task your task your task so",
  "starts from your task your task your task so this gives you the context for the question right so that's where the question starts I would say create a schedule GitHub action the workflow should be blah blah blah blah blah this is the thing and whatever this workflow is you should produce an answer here okay so after your Tex we have to it get the question that's that's how I would approach it in terms of understanding what's required see there are two parts to it okay the first part is know",
  "are two parts to it okay the first part is know which question is being asked so you could even hard code the uh key words in a in a in the question so for example if the request comes in and it asks you what is the link to the hacker news right if that exists then you know okay it is GA 4 question six now you have a function that deals with that question that produces that's DET that's that's Sol yeah yeah yeah absolutely determin so extracting the parameters you can use uh you can use an llm",
  "the parameters you can use uh you can use an llm to extract parameters for it that that can always be done because parameters are very um in that sense very straightforward for your question see if your question needs to solve something it will solve it a single way only right a function will have only these inputs to it so it will have uh this keyword it'll have two tags and it will have these points so your solving function will for this question will have four parameters so you can extract",
  "will have four parameters so you can extract the parameter values using an L that will be very easy to do l is very good at extracting that kind so fun so we have to create a function with all parameters to hand it like that you're telling I mean so here the parameter would be osm ID something along this lines here the a parameter city name what is the max that Bing box and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what so context is different right so we are not is AER ah so you see that will come",
  "so we are not is AER ah so you see that will come from you having tackled this question before right so when you've seen this question before you know to solve this question you would have written a small little Python program that gets you these uh details right and then this is the final answer that should come up the maximum Bally is like we use to extract the parameters and then do whatever we by determining which question it is yes yeah I mean it's a lot of work but again it's not never",
  "mean it's a lot of work but again it's not never meant to be a one person job I mean I would say if it's a 1% job it's very lengthy to do it and uh the other thing that will help you is um I think they demonstrated agentic coding yesterday right so make heavy use of that that will help you to quickly solve several questions put together a GitHub repo with some collaborators and you all just split the task among yourself you know if one task is a hard one let only one person work on that",
  "is a hard one let only one person work on that particular question get others to work on easier questions you know three four easier questions to get you will build build it together right that's that's sufficient remember there's no plagiarism type issues here right in PS The Learning Experience is to build things together and personally this is I feel very too big for one person to do uh given all the responsibilities that people have so exactly so for this question uh for this question what",
  "so for this question uh for this question what I did was uh I did not use llm per se uh but uh I identified the city and the country parameters using regular expression itself I tried and tested it for a couple of combinations I think it worked for me so do we have to look at uh llm integration for par retrial no no no I just gave a suggestion so uh in case the question was complex and extracting parameters was but yeah rejects is very faithful it will it will see we are not going to ask uh",
  "it will it will see we are not going to ask uh questions like in uh project one okay where the words could be different here we will ask you the exact same type of question we are not going to change the wording or anything that's why you can hard code things like you said using reject to find out which question will be unknown right which are the possible yeah but with rejects you can always match the word before the parameter and the word after the parameter thing that you extract in between",
  "the parameter thing that you extract in between those two words that will be your way to get extract parameters precisely you can do that using because it'll always say in the country right there's never going to be in the city or something to be in the country something a parameter on that's it right so your Rex will basically look for a string that is in between country and all okay uh I'm going to uh drop off the call if you have any more questions then you can ask person that still on the",
  "then you can ask person that still on the no it's not okay um I think that's are there any other questions real quick before I end this call today Arjun you have a question sorry Arjun I didn't see he also not on the call okay okay was uh was there anything else okay um tomorrow session they will continue um working through examples on Project right and you can ask these same issues that you're facing to them and then they will help you solve through it yeah tell me for gs6 uh we had issues",
  "through it yeah tell me for gs6 uh we had issues with options and what is that yeah so that's been resolved um the uh the question so what you supposed to do is in the answer that so I'll show I can pull it out so G6 these two questions uh you're supposed to find the uh value that has the absolute highest correlation so let's say for example here .95 is the highest let's say that's only these two questions issue yeah only these two questions so uh what you have to do is find the one that has",
  "uh what you have to do is find the one that has the highest absolute um correlation that's what the question should have said so that will be a sing so that will be a single answer no I got single ansers for all all the both the questions oh okay I I had issu in question number four and 10 I guess four is yeah four the answer was not matching for me oh right I tried Excel I tried callab both was not matching have you posted on discour about question four no I am trying it out okay yeah post on",
  "four no I am trying it out okay yeah post on discourse because if anyone else has the same issue then they might be able and last question also I had by we are not able to do anything because we have only shape function but we need much more things for this for this last question is it anyone has had issues with question 10 anyone solved it but actually one thing is that I pted the question and llm gave me direct answer I'm not sure that's character okay maybe I don't know yeah I don't whether",
  "okay maybe I don't know yeah I don't whether that understood like 1,600 stents asking answers and interpreted the most frequent answer I mean uh one thing llms nowadays do is uh they actually write and run python code as well so in the background they can they run like their own version of an interpreter pass the file itself yeah so so for question one and two we're supposed to proceed with the uh absolute uh closest value is it not closest absolute highest correlation got it sir so let's say",
  "highest correlation got it sir so let's say one number was -12 and the other one was 03 okay and you're getting both these answers but the absolute highest would be the minus .12 right uh isn't it supposed to be the positive value sir yeah positive only but uh what will happen is we want the so let's say you get two values that you get average distance of minus the relation the correlation will be minus 0.12 let's say okay you got that one and on here the option also was like uh minus 0.12 but",
  "here the option also was like uh minus 0.12 but then you got another one that said engine cap 0.0 you got both these values but the absolute uh all right to solve this question the answer question is asking the impact of mileage right so directly cannot we select Mage uh no it's the relationship between specifically you will evaluate the impact of mileage on these things right yeah on price rtion that's the and so then uh use the uh correlation uh actually I did the same thing process but",
  "uh actually I did the same thing process but actually now I understanding the answer itself in question and price retention so the correlation is the P the price price retention is resale price to original that is the formula but we have to get the correlation between mileage and the retention that's the question and only option mileage we are having two then then that's the actual answer right uh no sir but here in this question it's actually the impact of mileage average daily distance travel",
  "impact of mileage average daily distance travel and engine capacity all the three parameters over price retention percentage so it won't be just mileage yeah so what you're saying is consider the highest magnitude irrespective of the sign the absolute value got it sir okay I think uh we'll call it uh we'll wrap up this session okay and if you have any other further questions just post on discourse because then others also uh will know if a resolution Has Come For It uh so this is the resolution",
  "Has Come For It uh so this is the resolution for these two questions it wasn't clear in the question so that's what is expected even if you get multiple things match only one of them will be the correct answer thank you sir thanks okay thanks guys have a good night",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/cLJQej-Mq-Y =====",
  "okay um so yeah so that's why we want to introduce you to you agentic uh coding workflow the next thing we wanted to do was also clarify what some of the expectations around project are because there's some confusion as to whether to use function calling or what have you and these sorts of things so we will clarify all those things in this session um uh you can hard code everything okay there's no issues with hard coding the only thing you got to be aware of is uh the files that will be sent to",
  "be aware of is uh the files that will be sent to you via the API call will be um different from the files that uh you have and um some of the parameters may change so as long as you're aware of that you can hard code the solutions to everything the idea behind project two is from what spoke with his goal is it is too big for one person to handle so so that's why he wants people to collaborate and work on different sections of it and once we show you today's agentic coding workflow it should be",
  "you today's agentic coding workflow it should be very trivial for you guys to actually be able to do this right um where you can just produce solutions that even involve terminal commands and all sorts of things because agentic workflow is able to do all this so uh just um uh that's the the main theme for today I think the guys are ready now J ready by the way should we start streaming on YouTube as well uh I haven't set up the stream for today because last week when I set up the stream uh the",
  "because last week when I set up the stream uh the stream wasn't uh running so I don't know why it wasn't running uh it's just showing me a popup that do you want to start a me yeah but it's yeah you can close that because I haven't actually set up the schedule for it but I've started the recording so that that will work for today maybe for tomorrow session and Thursday's else okay uh so guys uh let's get started with this uh session so before jivaraj gets along with the uh tool that the cart",
  "jivaraj gets along with the uh tool that the cart just talked about I'll be showing you guys I'll be just wrapping up with the week six which the last part which uh involves you which uh the last part which was left of week six was just the network library so that's something where which I believe that should be covered as well though in the Roe it had few I guess we had a question on network exity as well so uh I assume that most of you people must be aware with that but just for for the sake",
  "must be aware with that but just for for the sake of completion I'll will be showing you guys okay so is my screen visible yes someone just uh give me some thumbs UPS okay got it so uh the thing is that this network is Library it's basically used for situations when you are dealing with graphs okay so I don't know if you guys have uh studied if you guys have taken pdsa before taking TDS but uh graphs are something which is a kind of data uh structure where we have multiple elements and then we",
  "where we have multiple elements and then we have connections between those elements okay so if you just search a graph on Google you'll be able to see what's a graph okay and uh so yeah so the thing is that networkers Library helps us create these graphs and then it allows us to perform few functions on these graphs to extract out some information from okay so first of all can font be made slightly bigger oh yeah for sure thank you Anand yeah for reminding me by the way is this level of",
  "yeah for reminding me by the way is this level of magnification enough or should I magnify it even more H yeah it is okay now per this would be much better okay so for that uh firstly we have to install Network ex Library it's pretty simple P install Network X and then you can simply import it the next part is your you have to initialize a graph instance okay so this particular line of code which you are able to see over here it's initializing a graph instance from Network x l okay so this NX",
  "a graph instance from Network x l okay so this NX is just an alias for Network X and then we're initializing a graph the next step is the next step is adding the nodes and adding the edges in the gra okay so if I just uh open Google and let me just show you what what's a graph is uh graph uh let's go this what should I write uhra graph okay so this is an example of a graph and as you can see that over here we have two components okay it's not opening so over here we have two components to look",
  "so over here we have two components to look at so uh just a second yeah so we have two components over here first one we have these nodes these nodes and the next one are these edges okay and these nodes are just covered with are just connected with these edges and then we have some fits over them over these edges as well that's another concept of Weights so uh when we dealing with the network X firstly we have to add the nodes that we have okay so uh by the way this if you guys have completed",
  "so uh by the way this if you guys have completed pdsa so actually this particular uh graph I have taken it from a pdsa grpa okay so let's go ahead and just check if uh we can perform these we can perform functions like the shortest path function on this gra as well okay so this is these are the edges My Graph let me just put it in another code block and now the first thing that I have to do is I have to add the nodes okay so before getting started with anything we have to add these nodes before",
  "with anything we have to add these nodes before and then we'll be adding these edges okay all right so uh this is the code for adding a node which is we just pass an entire list of uh of vertices we have in this add node from method okay so that's enough this one just adds these uh nodes in the graph and after that what we have to do is we have to one by one add these edges as well okay so as you can see that this edges list is a list of tles okay and from each and every tle we are extracting",
  "and from each and every tle we are extracting the first part which is this a and then the second part which is this B and then the weight of that Edge okay so that's this is how it's working and uh what are these A and B these are the this is the number of the node that we are connecting with Okay so this this 01 means that there is a node okay let me just use a pen okay so this 01 means that there is a node zero and there is a node one and then there is an edge between these two which have a",
  "there is an edge between these two which have a weight of 10 okay so this is how this this is what this particular Teel means all right so just clear this all and now you can see that firstly we have added these U vertices then we have to add these edges as well okay so the method to add edges is pretty simple it's just add edge and then we have to put in the vertice the uh the first vertex then the second vertex and the weight that we are assigning it okay that's pretty simple and I just run a",
  "it okay that's pretty simple and I just run a for Loop over this edges uh list and uh that created the entire graph for me okay that's done and the next part is pretty simple so your graph is absolutely ready to be uh experimented with okay and now we can run multiple functions which are present in this gra so first of all there is a function called shortest path and uh this one extracts out the shortest path which is from a particular vertex to another vertex using a certain parameter okay so",
  "another vertex using a certain parameter okay so over here we are extracting the long the shortest path between zero the vertex 0 vertex 0 and Vertex 4 wherever it is and using the weights okay so our aim is to minimize the weights that we are passing over okay so this is how it's working uh okay so uh let me just run this whatever block and you can see that we got this particular path and it's telling us that the shortest path to vertex from vertex 0o to Vertex 4 is this one zero first you",
  "vertex 0o to Vertex 4 is this one zero first you have to go to zero then you have to go to one then you have to go to two then you have to go to four and then you will reach the destination okay uh these can be changed as well if I let's say if I want to go to sixth node I'll just run it and you can see that this is the path I just want to go to the third one this is the part for that let's see for this okay so from sixth vertex to third this is the part okay this is this is how it works so uh",
  "the part okay this is this is how it works so uh now coming to the Practical applications of a graph you can imagine this particular graph as let's say uh I have a map of uh travel places okay so let's say this zero is uh Delhi okay and this one is CH all right so these graphs this networkx Library actually allows you to find uh to find the shortest path and multiple other functions that you can use graphs on to and then allow you to solve your problem so let's say if you have been given a set",
  "problem so let's say if you have been given a set of cities which uh and you also have been given the distance between those cities so uh let's say this zero is Delhi and this one is let's make it Chand okay Chand so you will be able so whenever we are giving you some data set regarding to work with network X Library so we will give you like this in a in this certain way where we where we are giving let's say coordinates of a particular City and then we have we are also giving you the distance",
  "then we have we are also giving you the distance between those two cities then you have to calculate the shortest path from one particular City to another particular City this is how you can expect some questions okay so uh that was a shortest path one and that particular that uh concludes the networkx library you can go ahead and explore the this particular Library it's pretty fun to work with as well so just go to Google and uh search for uh Network X Library and it will it will just take you",
  "X Library and it will it will just take you to the documentation page and it's a pretty good documentation you can simply search for anything you want let's say a spanning tree there should be something like spanning yeah so we have spanning trees as well maximum spanning okay so there are multiple okay we have random spanning trees as well so that's it's a entire world to discover okay so just go ahead and discover this slide all right so this concludes the networkx Library part anyone having",
  "concludes the networkx Library part anyone having having any questions anyone all right guys so I hope yeah everyone is speaking uh yes an oh no no no question thank you and rat Pria what are you trying to say in the chat box sir yes sir sir here G do add not from uh range I to R in seven can you exp this oh this is this is pretty simple so the thing is that in my edges let me just control Z this part okay so in my edges I have these tles okay and these tles are nothing but this first value is",
  "these tles are nothing but this first value is the starting vertex the second value is the ending vertex and this is the weight fine so to add the nodes in your graph you firstly have to run this particular function which is ADD node from okay and over here I did nothing but I just paste it I just ran a for Loop over so this is actually a uh inline uh for loop I will just remove this one because it might complicate things for you so you can make it like this as well okay so you can do like this",
  "it like this as well okay so you can do like this uh we are just put we just passing a list of all these uh nodes to our network library so let's say if in a case you had uh nodes like Delhi chenai Singapore like that so you can you have to add these vertices like this okay so this is how you have to add it uh it's not compulsory to only add numerical values you can add what we can say you can add textual values as well strings as well in this noes okay uh does that clarify your doubt yes sir",
  "noes okay uh does that clarify your doubt yes sir now I get it fine anyone having any questions or should we move ahead uh sir yeah yeah the index number 1 2 3 4 5 6 uh no this is not an index number this is just the nodes okay so let me do one thing uh let me create a very basic edges that this might create some problems okay so it's Delhi to chandigar okay and the distance between Delhi to chandigar I'm not sure but it is about 300 kilomet fine next one would be uh from uh let's say chandigar",
  "next one would be uh from uh let's say chandigar chandigar to Shimla and this one let's say it's about 100 kilomet I suppose and one more one and and this one would be from Shimla back to Delhi okay and this one would be appro uh let's say 600 kilm fine so this is a very basic uh graph and let me just run this one now if I so if I just want to draw this graph on this page so how it would be let okay let me just draw it once uh let's just okay so here is my Delhi okay here is chandigar here is",
  "here is my Delhi okay here is chandigar here is uh Shimla and this is nothing but we are uh let me change the color okay from chandigar to Shimla the distance is how much 100 kilometers okay from shim to Delhi it's 600 okay and from delh to chandigar it's 300 kilom okay so this is how your graph is going to look like now when we are talking about adding these edges so I have added this edges now if I want to change this one so let me just duplicate it come in this one out and now it's simply I",
  "it come in this one out and now it's simply I will add these nodes okay chandigar shim it has added multiple other as well I don't need this much okay so we have added these nodes added we have added these nodes and all that's remaining is to run this one and uh our graph has been our new graph has been created we have added these edges now you can perform any function you want like let's say if I want to find the shortest path between D to uh Shimla so it's going to be let's see it's going to",
  "so it's going to be let's see it's going to be from Delhi to chandigar to Shimla because this is pretty pretty understood because we gave it a very basic graph okay with direct connections so that's why it's giving us like this we just make it chandigar it's going to work as well okay so you can work with string values it's not necessary that you have to work with numerical values always okay so I guess that uh yeah clarify any more questions guys any more questions or should we move ahead fine",
  "any more questions or should we move ahead fine okay so ja you can take over for is the screen being shared or not e so guys just a second uh actually jaaj will be joining with my device there is some problem with his machine so uh just sit tight we are getting started so first and foremost we will have to install vs code insiders so vs code inserters is basically a kind of VSS code for Developers okay so uh for this to run uh we will recommend you guys to install vs code install I guess I have",
  "guys to install vs code install I guess I have idea here it is so uh for downloading this setup you just have to click on download for Windows and it will uh just download it for you uh next would be uh simply click on I accept the agreement and next uh this is uh fine as well let's go with this one okay I will like to create a start menu folder uh no I don't want okay okay let's go desktop icon as well add insiders to work Windows Explorer File content menu yes sure so guys a few people deal",
  "content menu yes sure so guys a few people deal with this problem that uh they don't have this whenever let's say whenever I have to whenever I click on show more options I get this open with code option right so the problem is that you haven't checked this box which is ADD open with code insiders action Windows Explorer File content menu this is essential if you want to uh see this okay so just check this box install and let's put it install for okay so uh inserts has been installed uh let's",
  "okay so uh inserts has been installed uh let's go ahead and check my yeah okay for what is the difference uh between vs code and Insider hello uh hello yeah what is the difference between vs code and Insider what does it do you're not audible hello I attempt to answer V code inside is just Hasa features which are not released vs code so it is updating almost every day while as vs code is only having updates which have been certified from Microsoft also your environment variables remains",
  "Microsoft also your environment variables remains unaffected so code will still work you'll just get another environment variable with code the code inside because sir you're not audible sir I think we cannot hear you so the volume is very low volume too low and some disturbance in mic no sir what was sarange using if you're using a same computer was he using something different hello this is this is better okay so the reason behind using uh vs code insiders is because it can edit files over",
  "code insiders is because it can edit files over here and it can even interact with your terminal so I was going to show how you can create this project without and without writing much code I created this project without writing any piece of code and right now it is live on versel and um at the moment I don't have example because it is on the other machine but as soon as I uh execute this file okay and then so what it does is it gets a question and then it also gets which is so similar to this",
  "and then it also gets which is so similar to this project uh to request it sends a post request so that uh application gets a post request and it is expecting question and file name in the form data so this this also so it gets question and then it also gets file and after gets equation and file then we have this uh this thing like is there discussion here so this is the question if I send this question in the post request then it actually solves this question and all this code is not return by",
  "this question and all this code is not return by me it's been returned by GPT so this code basically solves project two no it doesn't solve uh no it doesn't Sol the project too but uh like it can be used to write by itself so it have some part of project too like this is the function that will solves the this particular question this this one uh this one and how to know that this is the question that you need to Sol so here so special keys so yeah if these things are there in the question then",
  "if these things are there in the question then it can identify that this question uh is this is the question that needs to be solved if that is the case then it executes this function and then it sends the res I delete this file uh I going delete should I create another hold uh sir I think uh your voice is again inaudible sir hello is it okay now yes sir we can hear you know so I first sign in with the it's on my other screen signing window all want to sign G I think now it have signed in and",
  "want to sign G I think now it have signed in and it also have 0% okay so now I can use it uh so first of all I will set this instead of using edit I will use Ed to here and then model we can keep any of these so this is test project and actually I going to open this in another window G [Music] good uh set up AI server with neor and be that a so could you go back to the command that you put to the promt yeah yeah yeah this is the one I just asks to set up a fast e server with course enabled so",
  "to set up a fast e server with course enabled so that request and then we need to deploy to that's so this is the script that you have created and this is something that we can use on ver course it will use this file and then us then all and it also have created this fast API I so keep on these files okay so now it will give us the command that we can just run so then it will first before running the Ser it needs to install a few things so if I click on continue button it starts installing on",
  "click on continue button it starts installing on first to activate the okay must be the AV can acate the virtual environment and then run this now I don't know why keeps opening a new terminal every time it should not open in New terminal when I was trying it it was not open S before the time being I will just copy this command and I will this okay just have set up this app now what I will do is go to one of the G let's go to some GitHub stuff let's have a look at what this question ask us",
  "let's have a look at what this question ask us create a GI account and then if you don't have create a new public repository so so this is what I'm ask it now can this question use e so it does all these steps first we need to create the uh newos you can just go to the GitHub API and over here for exchange here and then uh here is an example of how you can use GitHub API gets the job ID uh so for a particular honor for a particular repo if you want to run a particular action then you can use",
  "want to run a particular action then you can use this command but it requires your personal access to so that is something we need to keep and then AP version this is something can be ignored it's not necessary okay cre the same import request but request is not available so it have imported request but it did not edit this file anyway we can uh I mean when whenever we send a prompt we can ask it to if you use some other package then make sure that you put everything in the requirements that's",
  "you put everything in the requirements that's something we can mention it but for now I will just keep this Cod I don't have request inst install so I will manually install and I will rerun the server so over here it is using Create repo URL so this is the URL that it is using then in ERS it is providing these headers where I need to put my token and then Ino data it is the repo name which is over here and then in new repository and then whether it is private or public okay for now we'll just",
  "it is private or public okay for now we'll just do this part creating okay uh this committing the file I will just com comment it for so the token that is mentioned here it's the GitHub token uh yeah GitHub personal access token okay okay sir thank you uh also then it was generating the code like it have mentioned here no he didn't mention but anyway you can ask it to mention so it the purpose is it addit these files in place and actually on Shan machine it is opening a new terminal every time",
  "machine it is opening a new terminal every time but on my machine it was executing those commands in the same so even it was giving commands for executing few it was even executing the commands I just have to click on continue and then it executes those commands and then it can even read something from terminal so if some error comes then it can actually read that error and then it can fix those errors for now I will just these s we already have these things so I token this is create GitHub and",
  "these things so I token this is create GitHub and commit file is the function that will test it okay we'll test it later [Music] now okay we can actually test it uh this going to be that okay any why I'm fixing it I will ask it to fix it go back to the same state this one and you create a end point for creating new platform now ignore committing and then uses token and then also and this is how Sol and loing so now I will just go this and find and I will reest it from my browser open I'm not",
  "and I will reest it from my browser open I'm not familiar with the F exactly okay and we need to provide to something and then name provide a random token and and then name this is to and then what all these different things are you and then I don't think I don't don't think I need toide anything else give it a try but I need a actual token let me first make a request F to create message bad credentials and this is the documentation that can be used so this isation anyway what I need to do is I",
  "so this isation anyway what I need to do is I need to get the challenge do you have ch for t m do you have right I create a new two settings okay test and this repository and then actually doesn't get that error so let me have a look at what is point for creating the rep it is https and then [Music] the name and the description and then private is these things and right now it's not throwing us the error of not being authenticated otherwise it was it would have thr bad credentials 4 now it is",
  "was it would have thr bad credentials 4 now it is 44 which is us maybe maybe something description something private following permiss so that we didn't set the correctly that's what we need to now I will delete then I will create another now I will give it admin permission and that to permissions uh is this one perm right permiss and parameter the rep is head to put these things a body these are the so Priss needs to be given and I canun let me to I'm not sure if there's a problem with",
  "let me to I'm not sure if there's a problem with permissions better can all the so can it create create uh new folders and files itself new folders and files in the sense uh I put that create a versal Json on my system will it do the same. J yes sir so you have created this file by your no she's asking that is it possible to create these files using GitHub using GitHub in the S giil yeah yeah copilot copilot yeah I generated these files usop like I first ask to set up a fast AP server with",
  "like I first ask to set up a fast AP server with course enabled so that we can send request and then I asked that later we would need to deploy it to verel that's why it created these verel so actually uh in my case it is not creating the file it is just uh saying that do this and do all this okay did you enable agent over here uh the option isn't there sir I thought it was by default is is this option available for you or are you using inside yours yeah yeah yeah yeah I got it I got it thank",
  "yours yeah yeah yeah yeah I got it I got it thank you okay so now if you enable agent then it will start creating did anyone is Stu at any point like not able to do this set installing it or enabling it so just you need to install it and then yeah tell sir is this safe to use or like how will it corrupt any of our system okay right now I'm using it right so if you don't I mean I I I even don't test it the way how I used to use it is I used to use it in virtual machine okay so that it doesn't",
  "use it in virtual machine okay so that it doesn't affect home H RS Okay and like anyway like whenever you generate some code it will write it out the file right so you can have a look at these files what exactly it have generated and even if it suggest to execute some commands then also you can Fe that command if yeah if it can be executed and then if you feel it is something that might harm then just cancel that thing no now this is developing but actually when we deployed anyone can give any",
  "but actually when we deployed anyone can give any comments right that's why I'm well we are in using the versal for testing anyone can give any commments and it should automatically generate its own code that's what the purpose of the project to write anyone can you give it on no no if I am giving that in the public to test it out so uh if I message High also it will generate the respective code for that no no no this won't generate any code uh this is for I mean before project you can write",
  "this is for I mean before project you can write codes using it okay okay just this is not uh this is just development of the project this is not actually the project right yeah okay these permissions then permission action Administration permission maybe read and write and then creation Edition yeah I think this would create the repo let me use this open okay hopefully it have created this test so in the response it sent few things and this is these things like it have able to detect that this",
  "things like it have able to detect that this is Shan token so and then yeah it have created this after I will delete it so that it won't be of any use if I now regen token so this is also the code generated by uh GPT itself and then uh this is for on Theo name and file path so if I all these information that is getting from here it's like honor honor and then of login which is honor so honor of login this is the name of the honor and then ra name is something I think it is here no not here it",
  "is something I think it is here no not here it is here so these different FS is is getting and then file path where is the file path is getting from file path is something that that will be sent and file content this is the other thing all right so let's try this out uh so for this question we actually giving a get request through the code and then we are creating the repository but for other questions we don't necessarily need to use the get request actually have done this for examp for",
  "get request actually have done this for examp for example there's a zip folder question or it's a Json file question or a CSV question we do not need to uh generate a get request right sir yeah yeah you don't have to generate a get request for those questions so like these things I can remove it I I just wanted to test it and then I can even for now I anyway it will work like if I provide the file path file content so this file path is on your repo that is available on internet what should be",
  "repo that is available on internet what should be the name of that file and then file content is what should be inside that file for now I will maybe I comment it any so the main function is this one need to keep a back API end point done post can we send this thing to gpg uh sir instead of Crea app. poost we can create a separate evaluate uh file and put the Cur commands in that file and then we can try and uh test it right sir that's also an option that is for testing uh so what is the",
  "an option that is for testing uh so what is the purpose of uh putting it like this sir uh app. poost like so for testing purpose like uh after submitting this project it will uh send a post request to this endpoint okay this endpoint should be available backi it should be available in your fast Epi server that's what we are trying to create this is to send a request but for listening that request something should be there so this backst API and point must be there got it sir so this uh so app.",
  "point must be there got it sir so this uh so app. post should be present for every single uh function that we create for every single question that we create is it question specific or it should generally have just like a single statement No like I mean it is a single uh it is a single handpoint uh which will get any question from five G so if you look over here it can get any question from ga1 to ga5 and then if there is some file that is involved for example over here there is this CHF file",
  "for example over here there is this CHF file right if there are some files then those files will be sent in file attribute and the question uh parameter in this call command will it take the exact question from the graded assignment or will it be refreshed or will it be shortened or something like that sir or will it be the exact replica of whatever uh is given in the graded assignment so I mean question language will be same even wordings will be same only thing that might change is these",
  "be same only thing that might change is these parameters this 5115 it can change to some other number then this Tu this date can also change and why we are sending a file that is because this file can also change whatever is data inside this file it can also change got it sir so in the uh post request the file is uh generated I mean the file is attached in as a part of that post request and so we don't have to upload any of the files into the versal application ourselves uh yeah got it got it",
  "application ourselves uh yeah got it got it by the you can check that on the project two page as well so there is an entire Cur request which has been given over there you can we are providing you the file attached to that particular request so that won't be a problem yeah sir uh for identifying the parameters can we use rejects commands yeah you can use like in yeah these bits you can look for it right but this is something that will be parameterized so yeah phrases will not be changing right",
  "so yeah phrases will not be changing right just the numbers and yeah phes won't change okay because I am trying same language and wordings will also be same exact same question with some other set of parameters and file can be data can and yeah okay and for our on G it should work mainly because yeah and email ID will be our own that's mandatory right for question email ID is like few questions have email ID right yeah correct yeah those questions we yeah it can change email ID is also a",
  "we yeah it can change email ID is also a parameter right no email it is for our J right so how we will be able to it's difficult right if I go to G2 yeah so to this thing I think it uses this email right it can as well no actually question is below one right not this one right yeah but uh you need to over here you need to change okay so those URL based questions also that will be having the parameters yeah yeah so it can change like this is email so think about this this this can be",
  "is email so think about this this this can be parameterized no that's fine but we while creating the repo and all it's difficult right that's why I thought no like while creating repo it will be it won't create any problems like this email got nothing to do with honor of rep this is something that we are writing out in a file no like what I me is that I have created this file in my okay and I am trying to call that URL directly here and if any other email comes then how will will it I'm",
  "any other email comes then how will will it I'm thinking so I need to generate dynamically the repo itself right for this questions uh like you can edit files using a GitHub API few things you can edit and then after editing there is way is to reun the um our workflows so this is how it can be okay okay fine so those types of questions also we have to check yeah even you don't like if you just change content of file this email thing then yeah uh you can keep Auto uh like whenever you push",
  "uh you can keep Auto uh like whenever you push something to your repo it can automatically redeploy like rerun the job so manually you don't even have to run the job yeah yeah no my has some issue I am not able to access using token so I thought so without creating and we do something I will look I mean you can use some other GitHub repo it's not like you have to use your student email address itself it can be some other email addresses okay can we have a global repo so like collaborative repo",
  "we have a global repo so like collaborative repo and have that function I mean you can have but then everybody might get different email address and then uh how back in back end how request is working that is not yeah we will not be testing par right okay yeah because I was thinking cannot we create one repo and have that flow like for these kind of questions you can create one rep I mean there won't be any problems for few questions like either create like if you create one then I'm not sure",
  "create like if you create one then I'm not sure if that will work okay and can you please confirm in tomorrow's meeting or something whether that email will be the email based questions alone whether parameterized or something because if that is primary it's difficult to do itself for everything not just this one but many questions are like depend on that one right just ask uh in Alber will the recording available on YouTube yeah it will be available on YouTube keep this second so it is backi",
  "on YouTube keep this second so it is backi end point and then if question is this one uh then it is trying to extract few things but uh we don't need this stuff at the moment we just need to get the question and then the file uh to now be having read information fromd file use to give it context markdown file P can we give context to the agent uh context with the chat like I can download this as a marown and then give context yeah that is something I have already tried it is very V that okay",
  "I have already tried it is very V that okay didn't do good job I can show it in front of you it it's okay if it does work that's fine like we can put some examples in the marker [Music] [Music] and [Music] um f [Music] this [Music] this here here yes that [Music] this is something it's not been defined and want defin do over here I [Music] [Music] [Music] go so right now it just using this function to identify the which is having Q do items and this is the request which uses sends question to",
  "this is the request which uses sends question to us and then question questions. [Music] what see [Music] number of dat and then time can be [Music] he up [Music] Happ so all these things are already install so I don't how to install them and it have made some changes to this function and then it have created this another stuff so Hand able to First identify the question and then will use the Handler and then the file that is there and then this is the Handler which goes with this file and then",
  "is the Handler which goes with this file and then it will and this is just a warning this is a good warning and then this is the actual error that is there so which matches M to this particular hand and that is the function so it gets the name of the Handler and then it executes [Music] it I need to put it in codes so now I think when I will send a request to this endpoint API then it should be able to identify this F okay let's Str that out I'm not sure whether the code that is is correct but",
  "not sure whether the code that is is correct but to here and [Music] yes [Music] [Music] EX [Music] okay [Music] so we have created this request which using and [Music] then and response in valid question or file format is what we are getting so yeah first I wanted to uh see if it works so this is like if for any fast GP if you have talks to it it will align you to this page where you can actually test end points that you have [Music] created and it does it by itself I just can put this thing",
  "it does it by itself I just can put this thing and then I can put question over here then I can execute it and then whatever response comes back it will be shown here [Music] that means doesn't matches with any of these and if I look for I download something that pieces yeah tell me yeah you created the server directly or like how uh created this are you talking about yeah this one AP yeah no I didn't do anything it's been created by fast API Itself by default it creates okay can you ping that",
  "by default it creates okay can you ping that I'll check in my system create just open back talks to it okay I mean I also figured out today itself when while chatting with the while using agentic mode okay I used to index. HTML to create one okay you use actually what I did is I asked it to create uh create something using which I can test then ited you don't have to create anything just up docs and it work yeah [Music] but it has some problems with the this like using regular Expressions",
  "with the this like using regular Expressions earlier it was working but now it's not working maybe because this might not be correct that's not the correct expression right you have gap between space and the end and end and yeah in the initial initial you go yeah download download then double no no no I have checked there are two spaces you're talking about these two spaces right yeah yeah only one is open that's that's just the F holder right there is the like if I go over here I try it out I",
  "is the like if I go over here I try it out I P the question it have two spaces here okay cannot we use just extract it oh I'm putting this what you saying tell yeah cannot we just ignore that download Line while the regular and just have from the extract it yeah will it not work so it is checking indication items and then it is trying to match yeah I think it it should work because it should work I'm just asking so that we can have it dynamically for every C without any download and so these",
  "for every C without any download and so these irrelevant things you can or you can even create a some unique keywords you can identify yeah I have created one phrases Jon itself for every question oh wait wait wait I mean the one that I created earlier it had the unique keywords itself is it this one no no not this one I think this is the one so it had these kind of keywords sort and then Json and then are and then objects asending if these kind of words are there then we can identify that this",
  "of words are there then we can identify that this question is this Json one keywords is difficult because Json many questions are there right we can just have S by Json s in Jon directly right yeah yeah yeah so multi-word keyword yeah yeah yeah directly we will have like in this question is the right which you show earlier this one no no this one or this one LS LS question LS question yeah yeah this is the one yeah so here use LS and extract all the files will be same that command will be sa",
  "the files will be same that command will be sa yeah this can be used to identify yeah yeah that will be same right so that alone can be used right I think we can even remove this stuff yeah yeah because only the file will be changing h so this is something REM and our parenthesis have I made some mistake [Music] me copy this St again this is wrong one invalid or file format uh what is the file format file format is it is CHF file so we already have a Handler for CH so Handler file and then it",
  "have a Handler for CH so Handler file and then it is handle LS file which uses chip f um so actually it didn't uh run this uh piece of code at all otherwise it could have created some files over here should have created this directory which which did not Dr tell also one more issue you have in your AP itself you are making the file as required field it should be optional because all question not that's yeah yeah that is one one thing yeah because it make it will confuse should be yeah and one",
  "it make it will confuse should be yeah and one more thing is that when you have to un a file it should be in currect format itself so we have to check with the extension not by just yeah yeah yeah so uh like maybe our here we should create a file Handler and then file and then like I mean there are five assignments and then for each of those assignments we can identify which which all are the different file types that might be yeah I will ping you I will ping you that one code just here file I",
  "I will ping you that one code just here file I think file name and ends with something like this that is the case if it is CSV then we need to do something else those kind of things I have you the extensions directly try this these are the list of all the possible expansions that are there questions yeah and image also they may save in both jpg PNG or jpg anything they can do yeah yeah yeah so here this is something that that is important thing like extracting jip is important for this you",
  "like extracting jip is important for this you might have to put some code like if it starts with chip then uh you need to unzip it first before doing anything so those kind if it is PDF uh I mean if it is PDF then we cannot do anything with PDF we don't have to do like if uh I mean it would be type part of question itself depending on is there something that we can do with Jason no is there something that we can do with Json L yeah Json L is the one that had prink both the Json also is there in",
  "one that had prink both the Json also is there in some questions in G4 and G5 yeah yeah but we don't have to handle it right no we have to understand whether that's from the front end it's being correctly populated or not it's just not the Handler because even if we give a DB file it should not take right that's the handle right because it will corrupt the system and all and and also we have to have an liit also Which F can be taken so like right now this project is not working but the earlier",
  "now this project is not working but the earlier one that I created it had these keywords kind of thing as you see instead of using single keyword we can use multi-line keyword and then those can be used to identify so this is to identify let me have a look at what was the identification function was there at first converts everything to lower text and then identified question is the set if it identifies multiplication then that is the case and then uh question ID and then question info and then",
  "uh question ID and then question info and then in question info we looking for keywords now keyword and keyword and then in this text we are looking for these keywords that we I think it is here so each one of these we are trying to find the itself it can be multi keyword thing that can be used and then also it can be function coling can also so that this is something that I did ear it was working I can findun it right now as well let me first stop the other server this copy from here past it",
  "stop the other server this copy from here past it here now it it is also creating some problem because of mean oh it is mean I need to change [Music] that and instead of it should be index and is it f or some other thing and now it now it is V okay so for today's session this all that I want to show does anyone have any doubts sh in case if you're trying to say something I'm using your mic sorry yeah yeah one doubt uh you have given slash AP SL right why that slash is record yeah both like we",
  "right why that slash is record yeah both like we can directly SL AP right why you are giving SL AP SL that is because it is it was part of this documentation project documentation okay no I thought like a then you will give it the params directly because I am confused with that slashes uh no no it will be a post it won't be no normally in post request SL AP that's it after that nothing will be there so why that slash is there last slash like if I change it I I think it won't work that's why I",
  "I change it I I think it won't work that's why I removed it let me try it out started the server hopefully the other server is turned off okay it is already already it's shutting it down okay I need to shut it down and then what about the other server it's been running let me on [Music] it let me check if uh it works even if I remove I think it might work in Mad to project I removed it and it that's why only I was thinking should we have [Music] yeah it works it works right okay yeah yeah so",
  "yeah it works it works right okay yeah yeah so it's safer to keep slash itself yes it works like that is POS Ian you can even put these multiple handles okay which points to the same function okay for that you might you would need to use one okay I open that file some multiple something some package I installed I don't remember which one no that's directly we can give that's fine post can handle both the things that's B yeah it should handle I think I mean in Mad 2 project it was handling no M",
  "I mean in Mad 2 project it was handling no M you would have used decorators for that that but here it can handle directly it's FAS uh any other questions uh yeah sh uh sir so versil when you deploy the application on veral it has a 250 MB limit so uh when working with 10 questions up till 25 questions I don't think we have a problem but once uh the number of question increases the more number of pack you have to install uh sometimes the one of the errors that I got was uh there is a limit on",
  "the errors that I got was uh there is a limit on versal for 250 MB so it's not able to complete the uh building of the application on the versal in that case how do we proceed sir yeah that is really good question actually I'm thinking to test it out by myself for creating all us creating solutions for all these 50 or whatever number of questions are there and if it can work with ver I will try to create solution and then I will try to do it before not before one it will be before quiz two and",
  "not before one it will be before quiz two and sorry after quiz two I don't know why after I will try to uh see if all these questions can be solved for now what you can focus on is you focus on solving these questions on local system if that if you can do that then later if there is some problem with versal that is something we'll Del it later sure sir I need to test it out if it can be done in versal alone yes sir and the five random questions that will be tested will it be tested in this",
  "that will be tested will it be tested in this similar format sir so the API URL link SL Docs here uh are the versal applications uh versal DOA SL uh API SL docs and then you go into the uh post request and then you give the command there and this is how the final uh checking will happen final verification from your end will happen sir it will be it will be verified using this call request which is same okay like if you use this backl docs it actually sends a cur request yes sir yes sir that's",
  "sends a cur request yes sir yes sir that's what I wanted to know yeah it if you will use what is provided over here so just that in few of questions file will be optional so keep this optional if you keep it mandatory then it will create some problems and you can test it using this appending backst dots yes sir s can we try get Pages alternative for versal G Pages yeah directly hosting from G itself uh yeah like if you push this to GitHub and then it the versal directly fetches it from GitHub",
  "it the versal directly fetches it from GitHub yeah instead of that cannot be directly use GitHub Pages for pushing GitHub Pages yeah Pages ah but then how we will be requesting like GitHub Pages it's not server it is just hosting few static files okay it will not act like an end point because in one G question it was the question that's that's why I just asking like it is for hosting static files it won't be able to process some requests okay yes should uh sir so uh we have to solve questions",
  "should uh sir so uh we have to solve questions for greater assignments 1 to five for five we have the answers that we have entered uh visible in the graded assignment portal whereas for graded assignments 1 to 4 it's not available is there any option to get that uh for us to be able to see whatever answers that we enter so that you know when we try to execute the girl command at least we'll know what uh answer that we've given we can verify it with that at least yeah like let me look for a it's",
  "that at least yeah like let me look for a it's I have you that one what yeah this is the one yeah I was looking for this one yeah yeah thanks so if you run this particular piece of code in here but before that we have to reload that one then we have to run this one I don't think you need to reload it see it works you can type but you have to know the answer also right so reloading will show the answer that's what the question was how to know the answer [Music] um how to know the answers yeah",
  "answer [Music] um how to know the answers yeah that's what the question right yeah yeah so so you can directly click on reload button in your recon saves right you have that oh yeah this is the one this is the one yeah yeah this one directly it will come that's it that's but don't Che don't save just check okay if you save it will go yeah if you want to check for the new like okay okay just first what what you do is you reload all these answers okay and copy it in other place uh like some text",
  "okay and copy it in other place uh like some text file or something so that you don't lose those answers and later you can check it if you want to test for new answer let is say you are writing this script and for this question if you got some answer then you can put that answer and then you can click on check button I mean until you don't click on a save button all those answers will be available over here in on these three submissions sub yeah and don't say okay yeah that's the m point if you",
  "and don't say okay yeah that's the m point if you save you cannot see the reason things because only three reason will be shown that's the [Music] yeah and Sir uh for the graded assignment uh one the very first question is the code uh hyphen s uh command inside the terminal while the vs code is being run so this is very system specific in this case how do we uh proceed and what will be the right answer uh these kind of questions you can hard code them just run it once on your system and then uh",
  "them just run it once on your system and then uh if request is made for if it is ask if application is asking for this question then you can just send the hardcoded got it sir yeah for callab question how will we handle that also I have to ask that callab one right yeah G3 I G3 ga3 can you go uh it's I think ga3 or two I think it must be G2 let me first check G3 G2 G2 G2 okay oh yeah this is the one right yeah this one and before that also after that also we have like M two or three questions",
  "that also we have like M two or three questions we it have this parameter yeah yeah that's what yeah if you don't if you have that uh statement like we can use our own thing then everything will be e here that's the only parameter doesn't change then it is very easy stuff you can keep it hardcore yeah yeah yeah so only with that one also one more thing go to the top second question or something just scroll up this image question is there right image question was this one ah this one I guess",
  "image question was this one ah this one I guess this image will be shved how it will be given it will come in the request itself no no output you see yeah request it should be part of response no we don't have answer right here yeah yeah so this is something we need to update I mean they will update it later so we discussed this particular question these image of image kind only two questions are there this one and the GFI last question yeah those things uh we those things can we uh can we",
  "those things uh we those things can we uh can we remove those questions or like how I I I cannot see it can be removed or not I mean if I I could have removed it I don't have any problems with this question yeah yeah no you can just discuss this one also and this G second question and last question of G last yes sir the Llama file question and the enro tunnel question yeah so this llama file I mean it cannot be solved on your that wordell itself so we'll try to find if there is some other",
  "so we'll try to find if there is some other alternative platform where it can be run if it is possible then we'll share that that information about that platform or what you can do is like over here there is no uh there is no parameter right so you can just post it once at at somewhere if it allows and each one of you don't have to do like each of these no still we cannot like it's a Lama file right it Rec a system itself I'm sorry can you repeat it's a llama file right it reords as system",
  "it's a llama file right it reords as system itself to host yeah yeah it requires the system that is the thing yeah one thing can be done but I am not sure whether everybody will be helping for that I am not also VM can we can have a VM which has been live and we can just host the L file in that and just hold that server directly you inside V will installing the L yeah the the thing is it needs to be it needs to be running each every time it needs to be continually continuously that is the only",
  "to be continually continuously that is the only is yeah that's true but I mean I would suggest if there is some possibility of solving this question at the moment I don't know where to do it like on vers this situation for sure it cannot be done because it is very huge file this cannot be done on ver so if there is some platform it can be hosted then just host it once and everyone can use the same URL indiv don't have to host it again and again or also S one more question can we know what is",
  "or also S one more question can we know what is the AAL metric for this type of question because it's difficult to understand itself how you are verifying whether that is correct or not this Lama one yeah l l all the URL I am not able to understand all the URLs yeah yeah yeah so we'll be sending some request to this thing [Music] okay uh what I I can do is I can give you those scripts which you used to send request to these okay yeah that would be fine that also would be fine and just the",
  "be fine that also would be fine and just the evaluation Matrix for all the URL question at least we can understand right what is happening I mean this is the easy one it doesn't need anything right no still it needs to be hosted right yeah it need I mean this needs to be hosted but uh I mean this you are able to understand like how you need to send the request to this endpoint you just need to use no no no no this is 8,000 just SL AP but we have one more question we same question we'll have say",
  "one more question we same question we'll have say same thing so we have to have like dynamically two question will be running both question I think same we would be using I forgot the question I remember yeah ah correct no not this one I think one one was G3 or G one I there were two questions similarly which had 8,000 itself okay okay if there is some Epi testing question like if you need to put the end point then uh can I will try to create a I will create if I some C request or something",
  "a I will create if I some C request or something that you can use test yeah yeah and one more thing uh when we have like multiple 8,000 to be used for everything we cannot stably have that 8,000 to be exposed every time right so in one G it's fine but multiple ta question you testing right randomly five G question you're testing and some having yeah then you can use some other port number like 8,000 no uh 8,000 Port is fine but uh that that will not be exposing correctly right for example SL AP",
  "not be exposing correctly right for example SL AP is there for you here it's B we have to use that versel app itself directly MH so here we are passing that uh H AP to the versal and hosting it okay H by default is using AOS yeah if you change that one it will also change that versal it will not work itself right versal hosting h no no this will be consistent oh that will be consistent even if you change the port also I mean you want you don't need to change the port okay like over here here we",
  "to change the port okay like over here here we have not mentioned the P because by default app fend yeah so okay see D if there is some question which leads to uh use versal okay then what you can do is these questions will be same right yeah the only thing that might change is this data yeah correct so so this data might change if this what you can do is you can create a personel server already running okay and on that veral server you can send this file in uh in the request body yeah same as",
  "this file in uh in the request body yeah same as which we had in for the project same as which you have we have in the project same yeah yeah same as which you have in the project so yeah that that is one request going to your project versal server and from that versal server it can go to some other versal server which processes start okay okay so you're telling we can directly use the requests command to initiate one more versal we will be calling that and getting the output that's okay yeah",
  "that and getting the output that's okay yeah that's possible and then you and then you can put link of that versal server the other one okay we have to have that much of versal servers for every question which have URLs just for the understanding right yes okay got uh sir just to re reiterate what uh you discussed uh right now for everything that has a URL is supposed to create a separate versal application and then uh call that URL via request every single time yes like these questions you can",
  "single time yes like these questions you can host it on some versal server and then the thing that will change is parameter on this data so this data you can send it in the request model yes sir used to send for this yes sir so for this question it explicitly states that we have to create another versal app uh but for uh URLs like 8,000 uh and other uh I mean those two other 8,000 questions for that also we create a versal appc and pass that in our code ah yeah that works okay sir right then",
  "our code ah yeah that works okay sir right then talk oh",

  "hello I think upload proof of academic status now you basically have to uh do this follow this process and you should be good okay then you just use your ID card okay so I need to like take a uh take picture Okay of your current academic status basically maybe your ID card you take or uh your transcript or something then mention maybe till when you hope to finish the degree okay I I I hope to finish it by 26 something okay but then uh anyway so whatever you mention now they will extend it and",
  "whatever you mention now they will extend it and if for example you are not able to finish I hope they kind of just check it again whether you are a student or not and then they will extend got it got it yeah so I think I'll do this part later then or I'll make sure make sure you use the latest ID card okay got it yeah yeah if somebody's trying to apply in December always advice just wait till January okay so this is March uh it's all right to uh apply for it right now right yeah you you'll get",
  "apply for it right now right yeah you you'll get it uh say for example you plan to finish it by 27 or 28 the degree right yeah you just mention that okay and if the degree duration is like four years now and if you're starting and you just assume four years of 5 years so they will probably take it it should be good you can try it doing that yeah okay thank you uh if I may ask question J and S uh yeah yeah so this is this is a trivial question related to operations so my my concern is given that",
  "to operations so my my concern is given that I am able to score around 40% in four of the subject four of the topics out of seven will I be able to give the interm exam H yeah it considered best out four out of seven right in grading document it is mentioned right and what will be the passing criteria will you guys be also considering the projects and everything like not for the grading but just to get a passing grade what what bare minimum is required um uh I haven't looked at TDS grading doc",
  "um uh I haven't looked at TDS grading doc given given given the situation if if some if somebody somebody wants to uh just pass the examination so uh the like he's he's able to get the eligibility criteria and then he's going to give the inter examinations so uh getting 40 plus in the endm examination and scoring above 40% in all all the graded examinations will that candidate be able to get the passing grade also where is so eligibility to attend the end term exam is average of best two out of",
  "the end term exam is average of best two out of five weekly assignment score mhm no no I'm asking for example uh to to pass to pass this particular course what is the bare minimum 20% okay and what was that Ro vitage has been reduced or what okay it was same no no graded grading is for those who want to get good grades I'm just asking like what is the bare minimum to pass the examination uh fair point because I have I have actually maintained something called like the minimum requirement of 40%",
  "called like the minimum requirement of 40% in three in gred assignments so getting the end term and then uh able to score around 40 over there so will I be able to clear off this paper or are there any other put in the scores and try just see the weightage like whatever weightage they have given now just put your score and multiply according to then you'll be able to figure out you should get more so the thing is that what you can do is you can just have right your scores on an Excel file then",
  "just have right your scores on an Excel file then multiply them with the weights that we have given in the that trading scheme and then you will be able to uh understand that how much you have to score to get a certain grade noing what's the bare minimum to pass I guess uh the total score you should have is about what to have in the endm I saw a website which somebody had made yeah don't not not not as gr something much more refined but I do not know who like why somebody put so much effort",
  "not know who like why somebody put so much effort here but you can test it out maybe oh this is the one uh this one transp valuator and everything uh I remember there was one uh Gade is it in a student handbook or something no for example in op uh like those with the programming examination they have a compulsion that you need to pass uh the uh the op op examinations along with the interm examinations as so my concern Lies over there okay okay okay so this is the one uh this is the uh passing",
  "okay so this is the one uh this is the uh passing criteria or something like that uh that you are asking V so uh you uh will pass if your score is greater than four t t score total score and t score gets calculated using this formula uh which is mentioned here uh hello okay so just apply this formula and then uh this is the chart you can use which tells which grade you will get based on the t score yeah so many of times what has happened I got a course a score of 37 but since I had like 50 or",
  "a course a score of 37 but since I had like 50 or 60 marks over there in the final examinations I was able to pass I have uh few of my courses where I just I barely passed so so I like you scored 30 or 40 in no no no no I scored 50 in final examination and I I got like 40 plus in quiz one and score something around like the the minimum requirement for scoring actually the like the qu the these four graded assignments that kind of criteria was there yeah so it should be greater than 40 to write",
  "yeah so it should be greater than 40 to write and term yeah yeah yeah so lot of people are probably doing H then right now only seven of us sorry six excluding both of us only four students are so let me know let me know if anything comes anything comes up uh because I like I'm not able to complete the U the project one and I don't think so I will be able to get the project two done also so that's the thing in case uh like for project two 31st is the deadline no no I'm not able to get a grasp",
  "is the deadline no no I'm not able to get a grasp of that only actually see so I was looking for just like I just want to pass and so Anand mhm uh like are you able to solve those questions using python which one which one uh grd assignment questions yeah yeah yeah so you are able to create solutions for them using python right I mean uh you can use some other tools as well I mean at least uh can you create something using um like they can be solved using some programming language right even",
  "solved using some programming language right even you can use bash so if you deploy it on uh something like Azure or somewhere then you can even use bash or these things no no um like it's the problem lies with me actually there is no default default no one is is at default I'm saying that I I I actually I'm not able to understand any of the things I'm just trying to look and pass the course so was looking out for the way so I I was going through the graded assignment um like getting a bare",
  "the graded assignment um like getting a bare minimum score of 40 you score well in r no I didn't okay yeah that's the thing because uh like I thought like uh in order to attend given that uh like scoring 40 in the last examinations will be sufficient for me to pass like J would you be covering the kind of because like for project one I think you did a marathon session now of four hours or three hours in which you basically made the whole wireframe on how we could at least submit the project uh",
  "on how we could at least submit the project uh yeah yeah so Ric we will be doing that session but before that we need to figure it out where we can deploy so I'm not certain about it how see I think I think the best part if people want to use their U I think ver is something that cannot I mean we cannot rely rely on that see you could do digital ocean car droplet that is the easiest to deploy people if they if they see we need only for one month I mean I I will be able to deploy it anywhere",
  "I mean I I will be able to deploy it anywhere okay I don't see any problem with that but I we need to also explain it to a student so it should be easier so digital ocean is like very easy all you have to do is like everything UI you can use J the last thing before I drop out um like I will I will be waiting for your response on that uh what is the bare minimum to pass the PO uh okay so just apply this tcore thing okay mhm so uh if you have got uh if there are four assignments and if you have",
  "uh if there are four assignments and if you have got 100 in them then you will get 15 marks because of15 being vage for it and then apply formula for these as well anyways codes for P1 is not yet released so this is what you can apply at the moment okay and then you can identify what is the rest of the marks that you get in order to pass the course you need to have 100 over there and in the final exam 100 also then only you will be able to pass this no no t score should be uh greater than 40",
  "this no no t score should be uh greater than 40 yeah yeah so what I'm asking what I'm saying for example project one I didn't do Roe also didn't went well and looking at my track record I won't be able to do project two also so I think that will be stuck with me look that that in that case I would recommend you to focus your entire energy on Project to and the final ter because if you got let's say if you got 100 and 42 and then 100 and final as well then your total would be 45 then you will be",
  "well then your total would be 45 then you will be able to pass the course isn't it and moreover your G uh your GS course you know already okay so you can take out the best four marks in your GS average them out and then add this1 five in that average multiply that5 in that average then you will be able to understand that what uh marks you should be focusing on on these two in in the first project two and then the final uh as end that math you have to do on your own and yeah in shouldn't like",
  "have to do on your own and yeah in shouldn't like The Institute shouldn't concern with my own the thing is the these are these are March this is a ending for each and every company so we do have a lot of review so that's the that's the problem and I thought like getting graded assignment only and getting the final score only will be sufficient to pass this course you have to follow this uh formula to get the final grade for yourself this final course score determines if you're going to pass the",
  "score determines if you're going to pass the course or not if it is greater than 40th only then you will be able to pass it okay okay okay okay then it will be difficult for me I think end though end has the highest percentage if you just see it has 25% uh weightage in this final no I'm looking at for example all three are zero P1 P2 Ro all are zero okay should I Z then you need toore there and 100 over here that's the problem and only then you're only with the final let's say if you've scored",
  "only with the final let's say if you've scored 100 in the final and GS you know your G marks right if you by the way what's the average of your GM Marx G Marx it will be around 40 40 50 this is our average 4050 yeah 4050 let's say let's take it 50 and that means that 50 into uh 1 0.15 that makes about 7 and 7 and a half yeah that is about 7 and a half and then uh 7 and a half plus your final let's say you scored 100 in your final so that makes it about uh what is 32 100 100 in anyways I'll just",
  "about uh what is 32 100 100 in anyways I'll just uh like when cartton will also be joining or should I uh will Carlton be joining the next session yeah he'll be joining in the D session sure thank you thank you hey can I show the interface for digital lotion if uh yeah sure today anyway we don't have anything specific to discuss okay I won't take much time because so probably want to close [Music] session for [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah so everything is visually uh I mean you can adjust",
  "everything is visually uh I mean you can adjust everything visually [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh Rik I think you probably might be on mute [Music] I wasn't thank you okay so basically this we can choose anyone and and then uh we have to choose of authentication either SS or password if people are more comt password we could just go with password and then I think tion something we'll have some these kind of guides are available follow how to set this up if you just follow it you",
  "how to set this up if you just follow it you can at least have the basic server setup M then you can take over and do we have CLI for digital ocean huh do you have CLI you can create y command yeah and so this basically it will be no cost because when you do this now uh like I have it I'm not using it isop pack right uh you get this uh see credits I have some credits I think yeah 200 they you $200 and it is charging $6 for running that machine for see we have to give a $5 prepayment but they",
  "for see we have to give a $5 prepayment but they give you $200 so that is a so if you if you do that you can actually run this entire thing and like even if it overruns for a month or something you have $200 buffer in addition to it but H there there may be a $5 prepayment [Music] cost got it and can it be detected from the same 200 amount it won't be right no it won't be just they take this one and then they give you 200 and they W credit it back you can see what I did I use PayPal okay I can",
  "you can see what I did I use PayPal okay I can always disable from PayPal yeah I I I always do this only I always use PayPal for digital otion so I've used it before I deleted my account because I did not have much use for it uh but PayPal is safe PayPal you can just disable access you can you can remove it from here or you could just disable so it doesn't make payment every month by itself right by itself it will it will make but it will make from this credit amount and you can just close it",
  "from this credit amount and you can just close it uh you can just close the droplet after you score well got it then you can use a Paypal payment method to kind of have a buffer between uh digital lotion and your thing you can use SI Hub as well but that is a little [Music] complicated I'll stop sharing the screen this is one option yeah another option is there about that aure thing like it can be deployed on aure as well so one day I was playing Minecraft okay uh with the python ta so he he",
  "Minecraft okay uh with the python ta so he he created a server on Azure and then we were able to join in that server and I think it was for free CU it he had uh student development pack that is nice if that works see whatever is simpler because we are like we also like everybody has to make the project and it has to be as easy as possible uh yes it should be easier and then it should work as well yes that is Baseline all the question should be solvable so uh really is there anybody else with",
  "solvable so uh really is there anybody else with any doubt I think uh yeah so I don't have a doubt per se but I just wanted to show uh how I deployed it on AWS uh if it's pleas yeah the process was not as straightforward as uh uh digital ocean but uh it was a little time consuming but the output uh has been uh effective just a second AWS free is also yeah yeah so I have the code up and running uh and if right now if I do like um to give it a question so anyone even you can access this uh URL",
  "so anyone even you can access this uh URL right now it's working so what is the output of code hyphen s yeah just a [Music] second yeah uh so this is how it's uh uh working and uh and I did complete a few questions with input files it's working for that as well the only issue I'm having right now is like this is a HTTP URL it's not https so it's like another 10 to 15 minutes of uh converting that from HTTP to https and creating that SSL certificate and uh this is not my primary uh domain so I'm",
  "and uh this is not my primary uh domain so I'm like postponing th these minor things I mean obviously security is not minor but uh right now I thought I'll spend more time on now that I got a public URL that's working with the proper API endpoint I thought I'll work on the questions further sorry somebody else yeah uh so and also uh I'm not very sure if because this is like a public uh IP address that was generated uh at AWS I think it's not public IP address it's must be private IP address",
  "public IP address it's must be private IP address yeah I am not very uh kind of very uh confident about the technical aspect of everything but uh here what did uh what happened was uh on AWS there something called ec2 here you create a in you launch you can create machines over there yeah let's let's do this only J I think because everybody will have to eventually use AWS yeah so I created uh I just put in a lot of questions into chat jpt and it gave me like a step by step process and it",
  "and it gave me like a step by step process and it involves a lot of uh you have to like um let me just open visual yeah so you have to basically run uh uh the Linux system onto your uh local machine so you you create once you create that uh instance on your Amazon w i mean AWS uh you have to use this command and enter your public IP address uh and then you basically run it onto your um uh basically it provides you access to that machine yeah exactly and then here you have to uh ensure that you",
  "and then here you have to uh ensure that you connect your uh local uh remote repository connect that with this and then uh yeah so you give all the pseudo commands basically you install everything like this almost acts like a technically as a virtual environment you can create a further you can further even create a virtual environment but uh I did not not want to do that for now so it's just the basic same thing you update install all the packages the only thing with this is like it's a little",
  "the only thing with this is like it's a little um complicated because there's like way too many commands so right now how I am running this continuously is uh there's something called a t-mo in inside um uh a Linux uh yeah to create a session and what I did was I ran the Python program I uh in inside the session and then I basically exited the session so that I don't have to like uh keep my local machine open continuously uh so that the server is running so that the final evaluation it gets",
  "is running so that the final evaluation it gets evaluated right now the Tark session is up and running and inside that the Python program is basically running the only drawback to this is uh so in case if AWS refreshes the instant from their end or something like automatic refresh happens I might have uh the the you Ur API endpoint basically might not work so there's something called a system b or either you can create a teamwork session or else you can create a system d uh and then you can",
  "you can create a system d uh and then you can basically what systemd does is it uh I'm not very sure if I quite remember that but there are two options of doing this this one seemed uh I started getting a lot of errors with system D so I just thought for now let me just stick with uh t-m Mark session and uh keep the server running inside this yeah the only drawback to this I would say is it involves a lot of uh debugging and uh a lot of loading and lot of core a lot of command line work",
  "and lot of core a lot of command line work basically so some uh I think like digital ocean uh it might not be a bad idea to use digital ocean no I'm not veryan digital ocean also has the command line stuff yeah yeah uh so I don't know like see this eventually we have to do AWS is the largest cloud service provider so if he it will be good on on a learning perspective but yeah digital ocean appears simple when you start using it yeah yeah fair enough it definitely makes sense I would say that I",
  "it definitely makes sense I would say that I I did learn so much in one day uh just trying out and seeing whether AWS works or not I think uh I think even aner will probably like it if we are using AWS to kind of solve this that adds a very critical skill and takes the takes the fear out of you actually using it know that is something which everyone should use and if DDS is introducing us to AWS and then making us do a complex project then it will really add value actual value in irrespective",
  "really add value actual value in irrespective of the grapes [Music] correct yeah I'll just uh this is how I deployed it and still there's like lots of work to do because the HTTP cannot remain HTTP I have to change it to https and then the domain name even I'm not comfortable having that IP address inside the domain so what I thought was maybe I can get a custom domain on go.com and then just uh no no no you do not do not need to even do that you can use root 54 something is is there within AWS",
  "can use root 54 something is is there within AWS you can actually purchase using that only AWS has multiple Services okay you you could check root 54 something in search you can go no no root as in R uh root 53 okay do scalable DNS or domain registration you can do this from within and then you can connect okay okay fair enough I think this would be I've read about all of it I've never done it I've actually purchased a few custom domains uh from GoDaddy so like I'm fairly familiar with how that",
  "GoDaddy so like I'm fairly familiar with how that works uh this is the first time I'm hearing I was talking about AWS so AWS part I was kind of learning about it so I read about all of it okay but yeah yeah I think this is also pretty straightforward just this even this is even Advanced like you can do a lot of stuff here correct maybe slightly more expensive butus project not not not very expensive price per year yeah not much expensive uh instead of.com trynet or something ah net. or",
  "uh instead of.com trynet or something ah net. or something yeah cost will drop it's still the same these are all the options do do do I you try it's not available T project 2 maybe put some random string okay yeah now it is yeah it's there but uh everything I think almost uh average is somewhere around 15 14 or $15 I was expecting it will change see go you can get it for 700 right but so you can you can probably just connect Buy on go then connect or you can use an existing domain or something",
  "or you can use an existing domain or something or it's okay just just use the random IP address that works too oh everything at the end of the day it amounts to almost the same so will give you about 700 or 900 rupees no no just select for only select only for select only for one year yeah just open okay uh yeah $9.99 H but you include tax it will almost be the same unless you buy dotin that will be cheaper that will be very cheap dotin or do XY Z I know for a fact is very cheap but think I'll",
  "Z I know for a fact is very cheap but think I'll delete this I think if you change name if you put some random name yeah TDs is 499 TD 229 excellent you go for that yeah yeah just just check if there I don't any restrictions or something yeah let me just go back to don't do five years also you can check at hostinger as well so they sometimes there are some deals going on and they can give you at very cheap cost very cheap price also uh also when you are after before checking out on go as well",
  "you are after before checking out on go as well just go to uh YouTube and search for some coupons yeah for go adding I did it one time and I was able to get about a 14 or 10% discount and it was pretty good yeah also on GitHub developer pack it gives you three free domains if you can somehow get it activated okay I actually tried doing that I was not able to upload a clear uh picture of the ID I might have to do it once more so I got this and uh yeah I think have to answer these questions and",
  "yeah I think have to answer these questions and probably yeah uh what was the other website you said for uh uh domains uh can you spell that just type host and Stinger yeah the first s yeah this okay so it depends on which kind of domain you're searching for so uh actually my brother see ultimately ultimately I can is the one which is managing all of this then these are all resellers so similar yes it depends on you know sometimes if you search a particular domain on hinger and then you search",
  "a particular domain on hinger and then you search it on good so there is a bit difference their prices and uh just go with the one that is the cheapest one and moreover after that just go ahead and search for some coupons yeah either on YouTube or on let's say a website it sells these coupons which have these coupons hosted over there so that can help you ah so it's even more cheaper here yeah it's even more cheaper over here9 for the first year yeah that's really good and make it yours and",
  "yeah that's really good and make it yours and perhaps if that coupon exists then you can get it hey hello you do not even need to spend money on domain uh you need to spend zero rupees literally okay you can use a do te domain sorry you are going to get the GitHub developer yeah Tech or name or something you get two two domain nameer so you can have two domain name any anything okay one is do Tech one is something else so you just use that got it I think to activate the pack as early as",
  "got it I think to activate the pack as early as possible lot of free stuff I think I'll shop stop sharing my screen then M thank you sh it was a really good presentation from side thank you anyone else has any questions or anything they want to present and share with all of us D you I want you guys to go outside and if there is any bonfire happening please attend that yeah will uh I doubt that there is something like that going on in I campus that is true I haven't received any information like",
  "is true I haven't received any information like that from some groups or something so I I I don't feel that is these things are going on I mean tomorrow there will be holy the color but I don't think it will be there maybe stock up on some Nar Nar color so yeah it will prevent any color from scking to your skin oh is it yeah yeah coconut oil is very good we also have to start talking about G we haven't made some preparations yet there is a lot to talk about by the way guys if you have no other",
  "talk about by the way guys if you have no other doubts or anything else to share we can end this session right yes okay guys so let's end the session and I wish we both me and J We wish all of you a very happy holy and enjoy yourselves by the way it was very nice discussion with you guys like you shared what all you are using like you shared uh digital ocean and then Shin shared the other approach which is and I mean I would see which one works better for students so that they don't have to do",
  "better for students so that they don't have to do much hard work while set setting up and they need to run as minimum number of I think try try AWS first because uh I don't think any money has to be spent on AWS at all because of the freetail but we have to connect the credit card do we have to connect our credit card Char we yeah have credit card or a debit card or debit card yes okay that is the thing uh that I was worried about okay so maybe then go for uh I don't know if if we if we do",
  "then go for uh I don't know if if we if we do PayPal now we'll have some kind of payment security then maybe we do digital ocean but then you have to spend $5 right then you have to spend $5 that is yeah like I was thinking about every student they cannot have a credit card or debit card uh in that case they can use uh things like digital ocean but is there some third alternative which avoids both of them I don't okay I may know something me know the of the cloud cloud cloud may have messaged",
  "the of the cloud cloud cloud may have messaged him or something let me see a sec [Music] [Music] [Music] Cloud research Cloud research okay any Cloud something was there I'm not remembering the name uh Lambda Cloud something like that it's a It's relatively new service just and I've connected with too many people that's like actually two options to deploy this on uh AWS one was the one that I showed you which is the ec2 uh along with the fast API and the other one that Chad GPT suggested was",
  "API and the other one that Chad GPT suggested was AWS Lambda along with the API Gateway and uh what it said was uh the AWS Lambda and the API Gateway is like way more complicated than uh AWS ec2 plus the fast API server yeah yeah setting up ec2 is much more easier yeah yeah it it's beyond some clicks yeah exactly yeah I think like you need to host it anywhere veral is like the only place where I as far as I've seen it's not asking for any payment uh credentials per se because uh I've had a",
  "uh credentials per se because uh I've had a little bit of experience posting on Heroku and similar other platforms everywhere it asks for uh even if you use it or not it asks for a credit card detail or a debit card detail and with Heroku it's like even more complicated uh as per India's RBI India's guidelines it seems that only you can uh have a Visa credit card uh credentials can be entered you cannot enter a only a Visa or a master card can be entered you can't enter an an IMX credit card",
  "be entered you can't enter an an IMX credit card and it cannot be a corporate credit card also they have like very specific uh rules for even entering the type of credit card that you uh need to be entering the credentials for on Heroku H okay I see is something that I haven't tried any time even I haven't looked on looked for some video or something nether have read something like AWS is something about which I have read a lot of times but I haven't tried anything and gcp is something where I",
  "tried anything and gcp is something where I have tried few things yeah but one you're talking about that these wees take your CR details and what so hosting the website which I just told you I hosted I purchased a hosting service from that and there was no didn't asking for any details or something was a simple UPI payment and that was done so you can give it a try as well and uh yeah hey Shel what are the benefits of free tier of ews how much do they what is their allowance uh I think uh right",
  "they what is their allowance uh I think uh right now just a second let me just go back and check so right now it's basically in free tire uh there's like a few different packages developer pack and then like another pack so the developer back pack is like $20 a month and then the free version is like basically it did not specify that I have to pay this much or I have to do something so what happens is when you're creating an instance right uh so there you're choosing your operating system and",
  "there you're choosing your operating system and uh all the other different uh uh small small things so there's options for free tires available in there you can only select those things uh let me just uh share my screen and probably I'll be able to Cloud something is there go Cloud okay let me Cloud okay I'm not much sure about it but I don't think they were asking for any payment for one server I we have to testest okay yeah thanks R this is something that we can try but yeah you have to see",
  "that we can try but yeah you have to see okay what the heck they do not have any free plan or something pring her ah ignore it maybe okay okay yeah that is okay like you shared at least something used to be free yeah now it is I think $100 the minimum one that is a lot yeah that is a lot and I had an account I should cancel okay uh talin is there something that you want to ask yeah this meeting started at 8 or 9 uh it started at 8 okay what is what is today's topic it's project or uh it is",
  "is what is today's topic it's project or uh it is related to where you can host project so that it works on all the questions like without I mean for sure I think versel won't work yeah it will not worker discussion so yeah Ric was telling about digital ocean and then Shin was showing AWS so these are the Alternatives that can be used [Music] so project is completed for them you haven't even started to yeah I started with GM it's going in but I was not able to host it anyway so for sure they",
  "I was not able to host it anyway so for sure they will be changing that uh markdown file of the project to write for hosting uh markdown file in the sense no no that uh that project page itself uh like you can host it anywhere it's not like it should be hosted on versal only the end point should no end point is fine I am asking the infrastructure that is not mentioned right there okay like like what you can use uh is it gcp or AWS or what where you can host it is it what your yeah that's what",
  "you can host it is it what your yeah that's what that's what infrastructure because file processing enroll we infrastructure right where can we upload where can we run that file because for hash related question we have to run that file and the hash value so uh yeah so that is something that needs to be tested AWS and then this digital ocean then as you these things we'll test it and whichever is better we'll try to do that yeah because I can make the project that can be run in anybody system",
  "the project that can be run in anybody system by cloning the G project and just run that I can make that's fine that somehow I will make B 3 something I but but interesting for this project would be to deploy it somewhere and that I not I have any idea on how to deploy that's need to be Al so after uh Quiz 2 we will have session related to Dedicated related to deployment where it can be deployed so that it works for all the question a glitch okay I have heard this thing glitch okay I am sharing",
  "I have heard this thing glitch okay I am sharing one more option I do not know about this this is chat GPT okay test this oh they are also giving some compute at free zero rupees these are for limited time right we have to R run it for I mean like if you run it on uh what do you call uh digital ocean then it takes I think uh $6 or something for one month for running uh what was the configuration Ric of the machine that you were running in digital machine the configuration let me check once uh",
  "machine the configuration let me check once uh create droplet just not created see okay Bangalore server regular SSD 1 GB CPU 25gb SSD 100 okay 1 TB data transfer hello one TP bandwidth right H one one one 1,00 GB transfer or bandwidth you could say 25 GB SSD 1 GB CPU 1 GB Ram yeah yeah which is pretty decent to uh run this uh to complete this project that's fine but duration will be one month dur be one month that is and and if you have the GitHub student developer pack you have to just you",
  "student developer pack you have to just you still spend $5 but you get $200 credit okay but then AWS is something where you can uh save those $5 as well but then you would have to use your uh credit card or debit card but then at least you you'll not have to do that Paypal work around H yes thing is it updated by the operations te uh Roe score yeah uh okay I don't know about AR score like did it what was your AR SC um yeah no yesterday we had I had discussion with class so he was telling",
  "had I had discussion with class so he was telling operation teams did not update it okay how it is pushed after like bonus and I think for me I got my updated uh score for the Roe along with the bonus Okay then if you got updated score then it should be for everyone uh okay I for me it's still so going 70 only that's go okay uh cartton like any updates on uh AR marks yeah J so I looked up his uh scores uh he's should have got uh with the bonus it should be an eight but uh when I looked on the",
  "it should be an eight but uh when I looked on the the push the push uh push TOs score spreadsheet his uh his email ID is not there at all oh okay uh that is very bizarre I don't know why his email ID is not there it's there in the first uh the first push to spreadsheet but it's not on the second it's not on the second spreadsheet the updat which is weird can you send that email address yeah honestly just want to commend that I love the fact that open this API spec has been used by Shi it's like",
  "open this API spec has been used by Shi it's like very nice to De those API points uh okay you are talking about that fast API default the okay okay okay fast AP automatically creates it yeah yeah fast AP automatically creates end points uh Colton like I looked for the it should be in Clips score from Jason okay yeah it is not there in a scroll from Json sheet yeah I was very surprised by that I don't but then but then it have some filter on difference can you remove that filter and then check",
  "can you remove that filter and then check maybe it is because of that filter I don't have edit access to it so I won't be able to remove that edit that filter I think you would have edit access let me I'll have a look I mean this uh JK handled right uh yeah it it it honor is JK sir but I think I think you might have access to it no no I mean he handled the the second round push two scores right yeah I looked for the marks in the CSV that I sent to JK sir that it will be there that I 100%",
  "sent to JK sir that it will be there that I 100% guarantee you in that score is there yeah that's because it's the script I wrote right so it should be there yeah but um yeah edit access or not see I'm looking at the uh which which sheet you're talking about the I score from Jason remove this filter you see yeah there is a filter on diff yeah H now maybe search for yeah now it is there I wonder why he put that filter [Music] what was the filter I didn't look actually I just okay okay okay I",
  "I didn't look actually I just okay okay okay I remember why he put that that is for identifying difference yeah I mean I think I can uh undo the filter anyway yes I anyway doesn't matter the point is uh they pushed the wrong score right I mean should I try undoing the filter are you can try that but I looked for Telvin score over there it is six six yeah and with one bonus it should be7 ah but there are two entries right oh no no that is yeah here it is six so this can be the this can be the",
  "here it is six so this can be the this can be the the correct one right uh let me verify it from uh the Json uh not from the Json from uh a scores portal from where we can get these sces no no have a look in the having in the look in the from what the script generated that should be the correct one anyway I think I am the only guy concerned about the score no no good to it is good to find outliers because if there is an outlier that means something is not quite right yeah I others also might",
  "is not quite right yeah I others also might have missed their SC they might not recogniz this that's why we are always very interested in outliers ah so telin yeah yeah the thing is the the last push that you made to the portal I did not make the you got six marks yeah yeah so what happened he he attended see that's the I think that's the issue he attended the um the G meet where he had raised the problem and he was assured by I think it was Anand or someone saying that they can they will",
  "Anand or someone saying that they can they will consider his highest score because of his unusual circumstance I lost my connectivity at 24 I guess 24 between 24 to 28 that's so that's yeah so that's why in his particular exceptional case that uh he would be granted that extra Mark yeah okay okay I got it you can check my back end also it will be yeah yeah no we can see that yeah do one thing tvin um email do you know JK's email address JK Mand yeah I am not sure of the email uh what I'll do",
  "yeah I am not sure of the email uh what I'll do okay look I'll give it to you yeah you um you write to him saying that you were in the meet I you have to specify all that okay that you joined the technical meet and in the technical meet when you joined uh you were told that uh you know even though you got a six in your final submission that your highest score in your particular case would be accepted because of the technical difficulties so tell that also that you spoke to Carlton and you um uh",
  "that also that you spoke to Carlton and you um uh raise the issue with him and he agreed uh that uh that it would be um fine to make the amendment so in the email you also copy me in on the email and uh you write that email to him then he will make the adjustment okay okay yeah see the thing is on he only he can do the final um adjustment we can uh do all the technical bits on our end here the final adjustment only he can do only he's authorized to do that actual dashboard push okay okay no",
  "to do that actual dashboard push okay okay no dashboard is fine that's my concern right no no it is no no see the dashboard score will be the final score what you get okay based on that only they will be again correct you will get your grade based on that so that is a very important score the dashboard score not not the stuff you see inside the seek portal but what you see on your you know your course cards that you have yeah yeah yeah that is in any subject that is the most important scorecard",
  "any subject that is the most important scorecard to see okay yeah okay so ask him to make that change but write carefully all the things that you mentioned and uh yeah uh then uh it should be fine he will make the adjustment okay yeah I should have taken screenshot every day oh no it's okay I mean we we we understand the problem very well and you can like I said you can make sure you copy me in on the email as well so that he is aware that uh we have communicated and that I'm aware of the",
  "uh we have communicated and that I'm aware of the situation yeah this is the email ID yeah okay yeah and can you ping your email yeah Jr would it be all right if I can uh show how the AWS deployment was was done to Carlton because uh I do have a a few questions uh regarding the how the final evaluation would be yeah okay yeah it's record and Cate it's fine right uh I hope my screen is uh visible yeah I mean did you demonstrate this earlier yeah ah it's already recorded the session is recorded",
  "ah it's already recorded the session is recorded yeah yeah I I started recording When students were showing yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's fine but if you have a question you can go ahead and ask the question uh yes sir so I basically deployed this on uh AWS and I'm able to get the uh I'm able to send a call request uh and I'm able to get an output so is this how the final evaluation uh be done is my question so what okay so what will what we will do is we will send a request see if you open up",
  "do is we will send a request see if you open up a small little Python program right yes sir and in that Python program you actually because that's how we will do it okay of course we won to use Python most likely we will use JavaScript but it'll be the same thing what will happen is uh in your Python program you write uh the write a program to access this endpoint yeah got it got it sir r equal to requ do Post uh and then you put in the post the question and in the body of the post as in the",
  "question and in the body of the post as in the data of that the post is sending send a file so if you do that then that is what we will do understood sir okay so that request will come to that endpoint if that endpoint responds to that request in the appropriate way which is it should send us back precisely AJ on with the key called answer and then a string with the answer if it responds in that way that's what we will check understood sir so uh it's similar to how it's been uploaded in the",
  "uh it's similar to how it's been uploaded in the course material Drive visit sir yes yes yeah I mean theoretically we should be able to send a request even via the terminal as well yeah yeah send a cur request from the terminal same thing understood got it sir yeah yeah and we will have any limit for that one time Li that uh I mean the response should come back within 20 seconds but for but for a single question that should be fairly straightforward right no processing questions it would take",
  "right no processing questions it would take some time right extraction then process yeah yeah but the extraction is not going to take that long right it's going to be a very tiny file literally maybe a couple not what I mean but still there are process of supressing and all we have to do right so I Frankly Speaking I don't Envision it taking that long yeah yeah each question is very simple generally there are some few questions that are little bit more involved but it was not like project right",
  "more involved but it was not like project right project had some very heavy questions but uh these questions mostly are fairly light and many of them can be hardcoded with a function that solves the problem and interestingly yesterday we were discussing about scrapping the front and right for G it was not working like I tried with good it was saying there is no details in the front end for strapping I see did you uh did you check with the T today about that no I I mistakenly joined the call in",
  "about that no I I mistakenly joined the call in 9 okay okay uh jaraj do you have any suggestions for for uh those questions where they have to examine the Dom in the uh yeah I can the questions also I think one question was regarding the summing of the attributes Dev attributes F and another question was getting the hidden hidden type in input value okay so Calton yeah like if you send a request to any URL yeah and if it send so in response it sends this HTML back correct I mean few of them few",
  "this HTML back correct I mean few of them few of them might send if it is from Epi then it will send GS and so if it sends us HTML back then we can par that Dome structure and if it is if it comes through a file then also it can be pass through Dom using beautiful sup yeah so that's what I suggested but Telvin is saying when he sends the request the request does not uh send back the Dom that's what he say compl complete d station because are like based on the JavaScript right can share a screen",
  "based on the JavaScript right can share a screen once and show us what's the [Music] error yeah as in show the request you're sending so that we can see and then we can advice on what uh what you need to change or why it's not working because my take was the same as the T which is you send a request with the authentication cookie and it should send you the and is there any project as of now developed by you people for this project to sorry say that again no is any dummy model developed as of",
  "that again no is any dummy model developed as of now no no we haven't created a full dummy model because uh no at least partial dummy models have been created um I mean we could but it's basically solving a question right it's a function that solves a question no just to understand whether you had Tred something okay I mean the TS could do that next week I suppose conc you can share your screen and show us that error just my is show that my laptop is actually Colton yeah uh we already have",
  "laptop is actually Colton yeah uh we already have answer scripts for a lot of questions yes so it will be too faster for us to develop project yeah yeah I know because we already created the answer keys for all almost everything right that that I know but um I think telin wants to just see a working example where you post the answer function inside a web servers like yeah yeah yeah that is uh like that is something what we need to test server is something that we haven't tested yeah are you",
  "is something that we haven't tested yeah are you able to see my screen yeah it is visible yeah so let me see the crossing yeah so question [Music] number6 yeah this is the processing file so uh I getting the URL and getting the text by HTML baring and finding the input where the type equal to hiden and getting the input value yeah so here one thing we want to see is uh we want to debug this right so we want to see what the what response is coming out of request that one you have to see because",
  "out of request that one you have to see because without seeing that uh it is hard to tell what the issue is yeah yeah okay so I mean don't put this soup part just send one request to the URL yeah and save the response to a file so that we can have a look at what is there in the file yeah or just return that uh entire response which is which and Ur this hey you know what I was thinking mhm you know there are these all these services that uh like AWS and all these sorts of things basically what",
  "AWS and all these sorts of things basically what students want is they want a a little Linux Docker container right uh kind of yes to I think AWS allows us to put some container and I think digital ocean also allows yeah yeah they all do but what my point is can we uh build our own uh uh containerization service where students can sign up and uh we host containers on itm infrastructure great idea all they have to do is then just SSH into it and uh connect to it and run run their little projects",
  "connect to it and run run their little projects in we did have something similar in system commands in system commands they do have exactly yeah but that's not a that's not a that's not a proper container right that's just name spaces that have been segregated and those are hopess no offense to system command but but they they have a Linux OS right so I think they can also run Docker containers in them yeah might not have permissions to run but yeah they if if permission is given then they can",
  "yeah they if if permission is given then they can even because the nice thing about Docker contain see the reason why they could not give a lot of permission because they are just name spaces that they are protecting so they can't do a lot of things in there whereas with the container students are free to do whatever right it's like they can break it or do anything so they can experiment like full system install any software they want because for this project to are we thinking to do something",
  "this project to are we thinking to do something like that no no I was just thinking because of not everybody faces this problem but some like telin and all face this problem right just thinking maybe we can host our own Services they can just uh run the it on our infrastructure yeah but at the end will also be using somebody else's inin can you copy this entire output into a file HTML just copy this entire thing yeah so here I think the issue is that the uh um that you need to send a token",
  "is that the uh um that you need to send a token right I think he need to get this exam. JS uh file yes yes that's what so while AP we cannot Sate well I guess that it's able to catch the entire Dom structure but it's not able to render it because it's not a server side rendering but a client side rendering actually this is not the strcture this is basic HTML Dom is together once the Ser is been connected right no no I mean this is the Dom but the thing is yeah the scpt should run right then",
  "the thing is yeah the scpt should run right then only this is not able to run it because it's it's supposed to run on your side Okay so whenever you receive this file it would render every question on your not from the server this is not server side renting that's why it's not able to show those uh questions to you what I do in this situation is try to use selenium yeah selenium can be used inside program yeah yeah it will be a time taking task yes moreover if we implement this in let's if you",
  "yes moreover if we implement this in let's if you deploy this application so will it be able to create a serum instance and then use puppeting on that server after deployment if it is a proper VM yeah even we can dockerize that and then we can upload that Docker image then it will perfectly work yeah I mean working is not a problem but uh like what selenium needs to do it need to open a browser then it needs to log in through your Emil an infracture basically and Tom needs to be in the path",
  "basically and Tom needs to be in the path also that's another okay we'll do one thing we'll uh we will uh contact Anand about this specific questions that involve access to the do by the way c yeah have we taught serum yet no we haven't taught yeah generally we haven't taught as part of the course it used to be as some extras like um I remember we used to teach it for scraping sessions and things like that I guess back in M4 term when I had was the part of no selenium this time we haven't",
  "was the part of no selenium this time we haven't really focused on WE more focused on GPT and apis and things of that so that's why we haven't covered selenium as such it's a valuable tool no doubt yeah for sure it has saved my multiple times [Music] and it's worth [Music] knowing okay anyway but uh for now what we'll do is I think we'll uh we'll check with Anand what he expects to happen what the outcome he expects in this particular situation okay this is for question number six and 11 also",
  "okay this is for question number six and 11 also yeah G1 Right started are there any other G that require access in the Dom not sure I start with this one Dom strapping we don't have this yeah okay we have we have I will tell theage question and the GF the rearranging we have to get that no most questions need to be copied at se right I wish I can tell you one one work around might be we can probably when doing the evaluation to make the evaluation easier on students we could probably send you",
  "easier on students we could probably send you the Dom anyway that might be as a yeah that is the easiest solution yes we could send you the Dom as a file yeah yeah then know that input is uh what did you ask D no if Dom file is been sent then we have to handle that right so like stor needs to know that we have to just get that do as a parameter then the because stor are not aware of that right yeah yeah yeah we we'll make a general announcement if that's the case but to me that seems like the",
  "if that's the case but to me that seems like the simplest way to handle it yeah that can and for now if you want to uh test I mean for doing this assignment if you want to test then what you can do is like uh you can go to uh your browser graded one assignment and over there in uh console tab you can uh copy hold document using copy command which is there in JavaScript copy command uh yeah okay work but that involves the uses of console no actually we will do like inspect then edit as HTML and",
  "we will do like inspect then edit as HTML and copyright like that we copy uh can you go to browser yeah Onin you are sharing yeah yeah yeah that's actually my back many you are able to see my screen right yeah yeah uh can you open console tab yeah so uh just go to console tab just go to conso tab yeah over here type copy okay and then bracket small brackets okay do m n t yeah and then enter and can you open some text editor somewhere you can paste undefined it's showing right oh no no just uh",
  "undefined it's showing right oh no no just uh open a text editor okay okay it will be like okay it is undefined uh can you do document uh can you go back there uh document. query selector instead of we can also use the dollar dollars just just type in copy and then inside those brackets type $2 $2 no no no just go back to your text editor okay it okay can you go back there should we do like this and all no no this is just I'm telling for testing uh no I actually how I copy is simpol go to",
  "uh no I actually how I copy is simpol go to elements click here right click right click on HTML right click edit as HTML contr a copy yeah you can copy it like this as well yeah this is a thing I used to do yeah by the way what I did is I just went into GPT and uh had a look can we run uh jaas and um uh what do you call what called Head L browsers uh in programmatically right and apparently there are libraries that do that so there is a node Library called Puppeteer yeah it runs a headless",
  "Library called Puppeteer yeah it runs a headless chromium so in other words there is no browser you send a request and it will run your endpoint as if it's in a browser so you can fetch all the details uh uh that it brings through using puppeteer or another nodejs library is called playright it also will runi headless uh and it will provide all the features of a browser but without a browser yeah player I Tred it but it was not working uh play right doesn't work is it yeah po was another one",
  "right doesn't work is it yeah po was another one and then I am not sure I have heard that word I think I have I tried using beautiful soups selenium selenium yeah selenium is like a headless browser so yeah no helenium needs Chrome in your path but I'm using WSL right it's not okay if I get like this actually I tried to do what I tried as a solution is that go to this ENT page run a console Comm and get the feedback for that hidden value directly this is what I TR I this this function will give",
  "this is what I TR I this this function will give you the answer yes this is what I tried but I cannot initiate that correct correct yeah without infrasture the issue and this question also we had to do what is this question question number 11 we had to do and this question what we have to do where there any solution for this yeah for this one you can use GitHub API GitHub API I mute it you have to config got something so like you just need to create a public repo and then yeah the email is the",
  "a public repo and then yeah the email is the one that might change yeah that's why so email changes every time right so using GitHub uh uh CLI I mean like if you deploy it to things like AWS or something then you have access to git right yeah infrastructure still be need right that's what I'm asking without infrastructure what is that infrastructure in the sense no if you have to run something in G or something we have to know the C and right yeah install right that's here the stand right like",
  "install right that's here the stand right like this you can even solve it using git itself I mean GitHub CLI is not required okay I mean you can use GitHub CLI but it's not required if you have a get if you have installed git command then using that you can push a repo but yeah creating a repo would require you to have G CLI that is not possible using U uh git itself yeah actually I had for this I had one solution was to access the git and change the email according to the parameter of the",
  "the email according to the parameter of the question uh yeah that is also one solution like you can keep one repo yeah that was the solution I had but how to access yeah then you can just use git right that's local we can do right infrastructure how will we configure I mean on AWS and these things you can install commands no token we have to pass uh using manually token or something we have to uh okay okay you can do SSH setup okay then you don't have to pass token manually each time no that's",
  "have to pass token manually each time no that's for local right when you're deploying in AWS how will you run these things you're getting my point like how I will tell for example while creating G while pushing to the G itself will will give in it and we'll copy that files and update the file and push right MH because git is been configur in our local system uh okay then infrastructure if you want to configure you have to do manual processing how will we automate that thing uh you don't need to",
  "will we automate that thing uh you don't need to manually process it you the environment that you're running in it in will have the environment variable anymore you store the environment variable in there okay like we did for project one you're telling like AP yeah I mean your server where you're running your functions from okay it will it will contain the environment variables needed to process the git communication or if it needs to contact an LL any of those environment variables would have",
  "LL any of those environment variables would have to be there on on the host even if it's a remote host and it is triggering the functions it uh it will it will require those environmental environment variables just be stored on okay like we did for project one we will be deploying in an profile where we'll exporting the envirment yeah yeah okay like that and anyone has solved this question there's only rck and T on session I think shini so you have to ask G G1 yeah g I must have solved because",
  "to ask G G1 yeah g I must have solved because G1 I think I think I did solve it uh are you guys making a repo somewhere is anybody making a repo somewhere where they're solving these questions and putting the solutions because that would be worthwhile right for everyone to see I just uh had a obsidian markdown file in which I copy pasted stuff but I did not upload it but not entirely cuz it'll be a learning experience for every they can see how things are solv actually just focusing on the quiz",
  "are solv actually just focusing on the quiz right now I just attended the session then after quiz I'll think about anything else okay CL for discuss also we need to know right these things this one uh database we need the file right yeah or we or we'll just give this alone by flaming it uh you just need to give this SQL query yeah the SQL query is the same for everyone I think isn't it this one no no what I meant this gold like type gold will be like reject fine so this is something that can",
  "be like reject fine so this is something that can change yeah so gold alone will be will be doing the re right that Al yeah because they won't ask anything different they won't ask like add some more Clauses to it okay just be gold bronze or silver okay no no here the ticket looks like different type looks different it's not colored now so is it like going to change or yeah this is also changing means it's difficult right and this is fine this one I found out this this one I sold cler you",
  "one I found out this this one I sold cler you suggested right saved answers are showing they were not showing in my Cas no I I reloaded this [Music] I am trying to do project like I'm having one backend [Music] file MH okay I I don't know whether my Approach is correct or not you can sest me so I will have this API end point yeah and I will have one Json file where it stores question as well question pH as well as the answer uhhuh as well as the identifier that is the task iding okay so if I",
  "identifier that is the task iding okay so if I have created like function for task ID it will just press the function and run the C and get the answer as I will directly return return from the Js uh else you will directly return from the Json yeah I mean the above approach identifying the question and then running that function is fine but uh this Jason fetching what is that like yeah yeah so uh I have this tax dox file M okay this will have like I can show that file also spe [Music] [Music]",
  "I can show that file also spe [Music] [Music] yeah so this is the thing this is the file I have task ID question hint as well as answer okay okay this is hardcoded answer yeah hardcoded answer so if if something is actually hardcoded then I can do that okay got it okay and some things we'll not be able to do like for example here the date things are there right these just to bypass as of I have so by this approach um there are two benefits even if we function FS we can like just call that",
  "even if we function FS we can like just call that comment out that so by this approach like in one go with tested code as well as verify our answers yeah this is good approach but uh it considers those uh uh variables right if there is some changes right so those are the things you yeah that that that preprocessing we are doing like parameter yeah yeah then it is okay yeah this is good workflow actually like uh for this this question it need to St the email this phrase it will reject then",
  "to St the email this phrase it will reject then directly it will find that like this this is right like this you can do yeah it identifies the question and then yeah it gets the question it's checks the rejects then pick up that except email or that thing which we want then runs the and for everything you using regular Expressions right yeah reject only with the assumed parameters that's so parameters is something that you need to figure out the correct yeah figure out yeah but yeah and some",
  "correct yeah figure out yeah but yeah and some questions need path that will direct will give the path if the question does not needs a path itself question directly we can use the PA itself got it like for example like B questions are there right yeah yeah there was I think moving some files to something yeah this this question parameters just this file and Shi file and this question also this is multi c yeah yeah actually this I could have solve that this question I was discussing there might",
  "that this question I was discussing there might be some problem with the Json no no we have to send that to our e website right and get that yeah yeah so if there is some problem with the Json uh then okay okay uh all right okay okay that cannot be yeah these files so these commments will not be right only files should be there right yeah data might change yeah yeah file will change and I assume this this can also be changing there the words to be replaced yeah words can also change but yeah",
  "be replaced yeah words can also change but yeah command won't change this these things won't change yeah yeah so I use this one this where to be replaced and word replaced directly and here also just value and the date format as such okay and this one this file like this I because others I cannot do any rejection I just started with G1 MH because this is the hardest thing they have mentioned in start right so I thought if I solve this one it might be and this question what is the issue I will",
  "be and this question what is the issue I will tell mul edit so here I will be converting the Json that's fine but I have to send this copy and paste this one right here set that needs to be done in that that was the issue we had and local hash is not matching with the solution uh okay just verify if the Json that you are giving is the correct one like if hash is wrong that means Json is wrong no I pasted that I copyed and pasted Json in this manually and it was correct okay manually it was",
  "manually and it was correct okay manually it was correct yeah automate we cannot automate right that's the thing yeah so the reason like you can't automate is because that Json has a has a private key that it is using to encode it that's why the automated one is not working we don't have the actual private key for that for that hash one more question do you people have like solution for all the questions by using python I mean most of them we do have solutions to them not all of them but we",
  "do have solutions to them not all of them but we have solutions to most of them because I am trying to develop only solutions because here I somehow complete that assessment using some tricks and all now if I am finding it difficult okay I will try rest of the things also and tell you what stop yeah has raiseed your hands uh yeah so I just want to understand how much Dev tools do play into the data science domain I mean as far as the project is concerned uh we are using Dev tools uh but I",
  "is concerned uh we are using Dev tools uh but I finished my foundation and then I directly join the data science uh diploma I mean I did not pick any papers in the programming uh uh diploma so I just want to know like uh practically speaking how much Dev tools do play a role in this uh industry in the industry you're asking or you're just asking for data science no I'm I'm just asking how practically it uh it plays into everything that we do okay yeah if you're talking about data science",
  "do okay yeah if you're talking about data science industry then Dev tools are a big part of it okay yeah I mean the type of tool may depend on whom your employer is but if you don't have any exposure to the dev tools then you will have a real problem getting uh work because they will test you on some uh being able to use some of these tools so that's that's a big reason why this this particular subject exist DDS because it the data science diploma doesn't have any other subject that actually",
  "doesn't have any other subject that actually provides these skills so that's why rather than sticking this into the programming side it is in order to address the lack of uh exposure to these tools that this uh DDS plays a very crucial uh role in the data science stream actually I am to using most of the tools in my job yeah and that doesn't surprise me yeah yeah because like which you thought Excel sheets everything I'm using FR and inspect most things iing I'm working in data sense background",
  "things iing I'm working in data sense background only python notebooks to automate file conversion make reports that is also yeah and python is the main thing which we need to know without that we can I mean you don't need python specifically it's just a language you can do many of the things python can do you can also do in other Legacy languages no yeah that's fine but most in like companies are preferring python because that has advanced so but as far as the tools are concerned yeah I mean",
  "but as far as the tools are concerned yeah I mean uh the tools are very valuable definitely you can't get far without them uh sir so I think as a part of our coursework as far as Dev tools are concerned we have like a few resources but is there like a good place or a good uh Point uh or good resource that we can uh learn everything that is to Dev tools I mean there is uh nowadays it's just the internet right I mean that's how all of us learn we uh we find some good resources then we just share",
  "uh we find some good resources then we just share it with others and say you know you can check this out and that's kind of how it goes we don't have like a central repository of these are the the best tools best resources you can use at the moment the thing is it constantly changes so keeping such a repository of best tools or best resources to learn tools also gets outdated quickly uh so maintaining that becomes difficult uh I think the fact that we have exposed you to the tools will help you",
  "we have exposed you to the tools will help you then find your own uh resources for it because you know the tool exists right and so then when you need to discover more about a specific tool then the what we do is we if I need to find out say for example I need to find out about how to use uh folium for example just as an arbitrary example uh then I know okay I go to the uh folium documentation and this is the thing that it provides now that I know a little bit about folium are there some",
  "I know a little bit about folium are there some YouTube videos that show how I can leverage it uh then if I want industry experts to give me uh some hot takes on topics like llms or integration or agentic stuff then you start getting into resources like medium for example where you've got actual experts who use it uh they will give you some good information but the problem with resources like medium is medium is a paid resource if you want something for Linux you could do this Linux food thing",
  "for Linux you could do this Linux food thing you can only when you see it you know Linux Jour yeah so that's what yeah so people just discuss with one another and then they find resources that way so it depends on the specific tool you concerned about or what specific thing you're looking for generically I cannot give you like say okay uh yes sir I I do understand that I think I was talking about one specific thing which is the developer tools uh I'm quite uh unfamiliar with inspect elements uh",
  "I'm quite uh unfamiliar with inspect elements uh that part of uh the H so that uh the you mean in the console right yes yes sir yes sir I I have like very little to non actually we had one course there is uh in in the week one module itself aren't there some very good intro videos to Dev tools not that one I think live session or somewhere I saw because actually yeah I remember that uh during week one live session uh we discussed about live TOS in great detail uh we discussed about the edent",
  "in great detail uh we discussed about the edent tab the console tab sources Tab and almost all the all those important tabs we touched upon so you can head back to people sessions and give it a look I think that uh the very first session of TDS we took we discussed 16th jary tools over January that is the session yeah no no it was yeah it was 16th January it was my first session yeah of TDS which I took and yeah and I actually ier that transcript it's easier to understand yeah you can just head",
  "it's easier to understand yeah you can just head back to the TDS portal and then you can just look at those FAQs from that session that would be much more beneficial for you rather than going through a 20 a 2hour long video session moreover the thing with uh the thing with Dev tools is that the more you practice the more you learn just go ahead and use those de Tools in your day to-day life you know whenever you building projects just use them and you will get a good gra of it's not it's",
  "them and you will get a good gra of it's not it's nothing like rocket science or something that's pretty simple to and also there are like 37 minutes of uh video from the Chrome developers themselves right and they talk through all the aspects of Dev Tools in there yeah so sorry sir my uh internet disconnected for a minute uh I was not able to get what you conveyed just now what I said was that you can uh like there are multiple resources for Dev tools so uh if you are uh if you wish to learn",
  "tools so uh if you are uh if you wish to learn from T you can go back to the TDS portal you can search for those Dev tools videos or you can go to 16th January's live session where we discussed a lot about those depth tools you can either just watch that entire uh live session recording or you can go to the TDS portal and just uh read those FAQs which were asked yeah C is sharing the screen and you can you can see that there are multiple resources given to you okay sir have you gone have you",
  "given to you okay sir have you gone have you gone through these videos these specific ones uh I did go through a few but uh it's been a while I think I'll go through them once more yeah and also see the other thing is you can do also is uh if you just search on Google or you can even use perplexity and uh do their use their web search function just ask uh give me some good resources on uh learning Dev Tools in depth or something like that right then you might find some resources that will work",
  "then you might find some resources that will work CL I have pinged you one reference link so that one you can use to understand any commands like b or something this one can be helpful to understand rejects anything if you want to understand you can use this yeah everything vs Cod bash commands yeah I'm using this one yeah yeah this is quite nice thanks for sharing this yeah and this is how we this is how resources get found that's what I'm saying yeah actually I found it in system command",
  "saying yeah actually I found it in system command session like stay staying for the session and was a good decision staying this long this is a sa in job also you can just kick refer yeah it's definitely this is a very good one I'm bookmarking it myself I don't know who I remember that I used to use it but I forgot about it okay I think uh we will uh end this session for today all all of you have quiz to prepare for as well so to us so um we'll call it an an end I'll stop the recording now",
  "call it an an end I'll stop the recording now thank you sir",

But so on soon sooner rather than later, it's important. What I see.  Okay, so we started the session recording is going on and it's speeding as well.  And so good evening everyone and we'll continue today's session. As you all  know that today's session is specifically to deal with any doubts that you may have. So,  One is available to",
  "that you may have. So,  One is available to take your questions. I would suggest if you have any questions you can start by maybe raising your hands. And it can be I mean if you can try and first keep it to project to because  that's synonym and then anything else then we can do it. You go ahead and just raise your hands and questions and more.  >> Anand S: Yep. All your people. Go ahead.  >> Carlton D'Silva: I'm amazed lots of people and no one has raised their hands.  >> Anand S: And give",
  "one has raised their hands.  >> Anand S: And give them some time. The record that I know of was held by NID students who  waited for two minutes before they asked a single question. I treat that as a benchmark.  >> Carlton D'Silva: And any of the students give a thumbs up if you can hear us.  >> Anand S: Okay, we are audible. Thank you. Yes, Giri. You have a question.  >> B R Giri Subrahmanya: Assert, like and it does start. But are there like Oh. are there more than one way to fall?  >> Anand",
  "are there more than one way to fall?  >> Anand S: Yes.  >> B R Giri Subrahmanya: Project.  >> Anand S: Absolutely several. And you can solve it in any way you like, But did you have something specific in mind?  >> B R Giri Subrahmanya: No, no. I just started if I paint one thing difficult. I can probably approaches.  >> Anand S: Absolutely, there is a philosophy is get the answer, right? How was up to you?  Yes, son.  >> Sathe Anant Shravanji: I would like to know more about agentic to workflow",
  "would like to know more about agentic to workflow to solve this aside project  because there was one session I have seen that session but I could not Med understood understand much from the session.  >> Anand S: Got you? You may not need. Agentic workflows to solve this, but I'll still  explain the principle is. You keep asking an LLM multiple times until you get to an answer that's approximately one way of thinking about agents.  The classic definition of agencies, the LLM itself figures out",
  "of agencies, the LLM itself figures out how to solve the problem and then solves it. The easiest way of implementing that is a loop. Have the LLM solve it.  See if it is solved it, if not. This is useful for.  many kinds of problems, you can use that to solve project to  But you will face three kinds of problems. One.  Unless your used to agentic workflows, it will take you a long time to create the solution. Second, it will not be reliable because Llms are not very reliable. thirdly, there are",
  "Llms are not very reliable. thirdly, there are actually for project to Or simpler ways of solving the problem.  >> Sathe Anant Shravanji: Okay, thank you.  >> Anand S: Yeah. Okay, question from Hardik.  How to handle questions that require images to be sent as answers.  The philosophy is the output will be directly. Sent to the. Exam paper. So, if you print text, It will be copy pasted. if you save it as if you provide the output as binary and image in particular, You will take that image and",
  "image in particular, You will take that image and upload it.  put another way, if the output is purely an image, the cleanest way for you to send the output will be As if it were a file download. which means content type will be  image Slash PNG Assuming it's a PNG and with a specific file name, you can pick what file name you want. ah,  from Ritwik. Should we stick with function calling them? I guess a quick. It's compared to agents.  Function calling is simpler than agentic and  You could",
  "calling is simpler than agentic and  You could stick to that, you may not need that either. You may not even need an LLM in the first place. Prem deep question was on.  Should we use a base64 string? That would work?  >> PREMDEEP MAITI: sir, it is regarding Previous question that he asks for answers, that that are images.  so, I actually asked this question a few days ago from TA, He said in the project it is written that. Our answer should be in.  Message in JSON object in message, which will",
  "Message in JSON object in message, which will be a string. So how can we put the image there? So, he said, it will be a base64 encoded string.  >> Anand S: a good point, in fact, when they ask me the last time I gave the same answer and they corrected me last time as well, so thanks for correcting me on this. Ahmed,  the response. Yes, must be a JSON object and therefore please make it a data URI.  And hardik. I stand corrected. Apologies for that. ah,  Comment from Avinash. We don't need to",
  "that. ah,  Comment from Avinash. We don't need to handle tasks, which require Ms, Excel, or like running some command in vs code. Yes. You need to provide the  answers to those as well. How to provide that.  One option is you actually run vs code or you actually run Excel and get the Or, you know, the question. I'm not going to give you some question.

Sometimes we may not end up in with a very right exact solution that we are looking for. So how do we create a  feedback loop here to like end up with the exact solution that you are looking for?  >> Anand S: Possibility. Number one. Try out different prompts and see which one gives the result, right? 90% of the time 99%",
  "one gives the result, right? 90% of the time 99% of the time and so on.  Second approach.  Take the output of the LLM, send it to the LLM again, and check have it. Check if it is right and repeat multiple times.  Option 3, Execute the result of the LLM. See if it is correct. Send the output and or the error message to an LLM and repeat the latter. Two are more along the lines of And agentic behavior. But all of these approaches as we go deeper into this approaches increase in  complexity. So",

So  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Sir, regarding Ga2 questions regarding the deployments.  We have to deploy it in a local endpoint that is heat those 29000 or some other deployment point.  >> Anand S: Yes. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: So, will the question be parameterized?

In some GA questions, we have to use DEVTOOLS. To solve the questions. There are some elements that are hidden.

But yeah, the script will effectively have A set of questions.  a randomly picked from across the 50 and with random parameterization and will take that exact string and send it as a query parameter. In fact by you, creating the  test script and me validating it, it will help me. I won't have to create it at the end. I may end up copy pasting from yours and if you've tested it on your own scripts, hopefully that your programs will do  better. So",

Actually, I have a suggestion that I wish to give said like we have  got this deadline about 29 30th of March.

So Yeah, we can do some tests and it would be done. Nice. Major concerns would be addressed.  >> Anand S: I think that's a great idea, though. What? There are two ways of going about it, what you're saying is Anand, could you officially do a test run? How about we do it differently? You are officially do a test run. And I'm happy to comment on",
  "do a test run. And I'm happy to comment on what aspects of the test run work. Don't work.  Raise those questions. and part of the reason I'm nudging towards this is To have everyone moves towards Sinha environment, where you don't have to ask for things, do it. It's better to ask forgiveness than permission.

When will you get your score and  second, when can you get a script that does reasonably well? The answer to the first is  To begin with an apology from me. I was to have evaluated the results.

And there are a large number of zeros, so we",

So yeah, just bear with us a little bit.  >> Jayakrishnan Warriem: Yeah, so one input from the administration side is here, asking Anand note to be liberal for project one, just giving a heads up to all students, who have joined over here. If you get a zero then in project run you will get a 0. Is what you should conclude.  >> Anand",

So,  in GA 4, some questions are dynamic or live scrapping, we have doing like questions, like Those scorecard related over.  Movies details, those are like customs.

The answer was wrong by live, only we tried debugging and we corrected this manually.  >> Anand S: Ha, yes.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: I think I you understand the question regarding movies title. We had some issues. This emulator is  With the website, as well as we had in favor Lexus script.  >> Anand S: Yes.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: That. Yeah. >>",
  "Anand S: Yes.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: That. Yeah. >> Anand S: and that is correctly a little specifically. Take that one, the results that you got where different from the results that where received by the evaluation script, right? So the question is, how exactly will the scraping for comparison be done for the IMDB top 2?  In short, it will be done exactly the same way that the exam script is doing right now. In other words, if you get it right, if your answer were to be copy pasted into the",
  "if your answer were to be copy pasted into the exam script and it works. It will be right here. Also,  Now, what that means is you need to know how the exam script is scraping IMDb. Use a network tools. You'll be able to figure that out.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Okay. Okay. And URLs for the, those types of question will not change, right? Only when it's like  >> Anand S: Yeah, just check with any one other student if they get exactly the same URL  you will get the same URL if they get something",
  "you will get the same URL if they get something different, only those things will be different.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: In that G8 itself. Few questions we have to get like  github, who is the best use of like first useful and get up or some questions which are going in?

We will make sure that",
  ">> Anand S: True. We will make sure that  the evaluation that is when the question is framed, the value that it picks up is just before it is sent to you. so, that lag will be within 20 seconds.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Okay, so it will be mostly constant over the >> Anand S: Correct. And the questions themselves were designed to be somewhat robust that these are not things for instance.  Let us take the newest user who has more than a certain number of stars. Or. Who has the largest number of",
  "of stars. Or. Who has the largest number of followers. A new user will not be able to get a large number of followers. So that is why the question was framed that way that  it will not change within a few minutes? It'll usually take a few days or possibly weeks to change? To that extent. There is a certain degree of robustness to be safe. We will it only probably an hour before you buy.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Spot and Scrapping PDF related questions, Will the structure of PDF be same?  >> Anand",

So I thought like using coke these worksheets and these llm passing, they send messages on their progress and what they did, and what they ate. And how that.

I think we are in that.  transition Era, Five years later, I suspect that a larger volume of data science would be done without needing to know programs because Llms will be",
  "needing to know programs because Llms will be able to write the code.  five years ago, a fair bit of data science was really data analytics and even tedious could to reasonable extent. Be done with Not that much a knowledge of code. we are in that transitional era, where  A year, two years, three years down the line, the vast majority of what people  will look for. In a job is the current set of skills. It is a pity and it's great that your requesting your mentor support. I do hope you get it.",

So could you elaborate how we will be? Deploying our project and how evaluation will be that, will it be like Docker file will be getting like that which",
  "like Docker file will be getting like that which we hadn't calling on  >> Anand S: No, you run it wherever you want and just share a URL.  Entirely update. Not that API must be running somewhere. keep in mind that the APA doesn't need to do the machine that serves the APN doesn't have to do all the work by itself.  you can federate it you can say if I get a question and it is related to question, you know, say Ga2 question 4 to pick one at random. That I will send to another server.  Now that",

The rules against that. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, no. I I did not get here, but I was asking the related some like, some questions we need file and that it should be processed.  So what I understand, I can explain. So I was trying to do GA one alone and starting and I had few questions on 5 handling. So",
  "and I had few questions on 5 handling. So what I did in my local system, I downloaded file and preprocess a file and both answer and fed it into the Jason file and get the output.

That's the direction that you'll be able to explore for this one.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Okay.  >> Jayakrishnan Warriem: so go back to the definition of what a file is and That should give you some more hint.

  ">> Anand S: Another hint when you get stuck with things like this, that sound impossible.  another way to ideate is to pose the question to chat GP.  Have this problem in versa. I cannot save the file. What can I do? Try question.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Yeah, I kill.  >> Anand S: in a very different. You know.  Please torture.

  "And moving that questioning ability is really what will get us a job in the next decade or so.  so, if you what I'm saying particularly is especially where you think it probably? How will I even ask the question? I can't even frame it properly, how  will it even know something like this. Those are exactly the things that you should try and it's okay to try and fail and not specifically to you just  general advice to you.  >> TELVIN VARGHESE: Okay, so the answer is we have we have to do it in",
  "so the answer is we have we have to do it in memory itself.  >> Anand S: Please. >> TELVIN VARGHESE: That's let me try it out. Even if I feel, I mean, positive and discuss.  >> Anand S: Okay, Saakshi has a question in G3, Question 4, The base 64 image Has your roll  number in it.

Okay, there's a complete  >> SIVANS: Today, I have a question for mentorship. A very profession, a little different from what the session is about. So can I ask",
  "from what the session is about. So can I ask after this, it would be two minutes not more than that.  >> Anand S: Go ahead. We have a minute, so go ahead.  >> SIVANS: yeah, so actually after the first project was over actually I did not I could not get the right thing in it because of  so, I found out some people and I started on my own so as I asked in the arrow, Should do. The bottom. So, what I figured out sir with other people is that some people told me that your your bit slow in taking",
  "people told me that your your bit slow in taking learning some technology some techniques on offline, some projects. So sir, actually I want to understand that I the people from different background, sometimes they're masters I get, I tend to get a bit demotivated because when somebody  Comes, they are very fast in that coding thing. Well, I was not in the  beginning of this thing. I told my seniors. I know some senior people that I would be because I think this is good.  And I started, and in",
  "I think this is good.  And I started, and in three weeks, I did really well after that, I was travel. Ing. I want to understand so that does this mean that our aptitude is less towards technology because sometimes I feel really low and some people Say, you're not with your attitude is not.  very, if you are struggling so much you are giving 20 30 hours weekly to understand the basically, Cool. X-rays that I get to be motivated thinking.  >> Anand S: Got you, and  Nothing wrong in getting",
  "Anand S: Got you, and  Nothing wrong in getting demotivated. Also. So, it's okay. And there are, and  I think that if we have an aptitude in a certain area, we tend to learn faster in those areas, conversely people who tend to lose, learn slower and certain areas tend to have a lesser aptitude for it. My interest in music is very high. I learned very soon that I have very little aptitude for it. My interest in  design is very high. I've been trying to draw cartoon to my dream as a child was to",
  "to draw cartoon to my dream as a child was to become a cartoonist for Disney. I put a gun to my head. I still can't draw. Programming.  Just happened to come along until I was programming continuously for about 15 years before I realized that that is something that I'm really really good at and also enjoy a lot. Some of these are accidental.  but what I found was, The effort that I put in into, let's say cartoony. Meant that I would never become a good cartoonist, but because I was good at",
  "a good cartoonist, but because I was good at programming, I was able to build programs that could draw cartoons. and Star TV saw that they said, Oh, can you build us an application that can create dashboards with cartoons in it? I said, Wow, this is fabulous. Let me do that. And start TV was acquired by Fox.  Fox was acquired by Disney. And at that point, I realized that I am drawing cartoons for Disney. Even though I can't draw a thing. Life takes us along strange parts. The effort that you",
  "takes us along strange parts. The effort that you put in will pay off. it's very hard to figure out whether it'll pay off the way you want it to, or in in some other way. Nothing wrong and getting demotivated. Because when we are demotivated that's what drives us to put effort in certain ways or sometimes it drives us away from doing things into things that will be more productive. So it's a valid emotion. let it be. but do recognize that right now for the effort that you've put in, The return",
  "now for the effort that you've put in, The return is not high, perhaps because you haven't yet gotten the aptitude for it yet and it's okay if you don't  >> SIVANS: then this is really well, like, believe me for  Doing further, because Some sometimes I really get shifted from the car, thanks.  >> Anand S: Gokul. Hey, Google. >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Hello, sir. So I have one more suggestion since the project works are a bit time-taking and I would say, like, we need to understand a lot. Can't we",
  "say, like, we need to understand a lot. Can't we make it similar to the  mad courses, where we have a separate a project that had like that carries its own credits, so that it will become like an extensive course coastal together.  >> Anand S: Possibly, that's one direction to go. Which is giving you more time, more freedom to explore. I tend to push things the other way. Meaning ideally project one and Project 2 should be one day projects. He hold on with one month, we are not able to solve",
  "hold on with one month, we are not able to solve it. How on earth will be able to solve it in one day. Truth is. a big part of the amount of time. Something will take, is a function of how much time we give it. if you had to solve it in one day, you will solve it in one day and your grades will be only slightly less what's happening today in an LLM world is Are capabilities are being amplified dramatically. But we haven't yet learned how to leverage those capabilities. The best way, maybe you",
  "those capabilities. The best way, maybe you could just mute yourself Google, there is some echo. Text.  I find that necessity is the mother of invention. The best way to push people to learn something. Is when they have no choice, so,  I try and crunch the timelines to the point where you have a large number of challenges,  with, as little time to do something and then you'll realize that it's impossible to do it the way you used to. And you will be forced to use LMS and learn to do things in a",
  "be forced to use LMS and learn to do things in a way that is different from how you used to, which is what the industry is looking for. When  you graduate And hopefully, that will accelerate the cycle. So in short, no, I don't think I'll go towards the Mad one direction. In fact, I'll be nudging tejesh 2 to the opposite which is shrink these into multiple projects into the same term and in a TDS we will  have we'll figure out something but ways in which these projects Can actually be done in a",
  "in which these projects Can actually be done in a hell of a lot less time.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Sure, I understand like I'm working professional. So for me to actually do solve like a when I was solving the assignments. Yeah, I tend to do it at the last minute and I was able to solve all those assignments and I had actually completed all my assignments. Maybe I scored like 90 above in most of my  assignments, but  at least for the sake of projects, I wanted to give it more time. So can I can",
  "I wanted to give it more time. So can I can like delve into those concepts to understand it further? So it was my intention to understand it. >> Anand S: A good one. A very good one, a very valid one and it's strongly. Encourage you to pick up a project on your own. There are things that we learn for the shared pleasure of it to go deep.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: oh, >> Anand S: explore and so on. And the nice thing about those is the people who want to do that. Don't lack motivation, they enjoy",
  "to do that. Don't lack motivation, they enjoy doing it. Beautiful, take that up. The ones that we are forced to is where we get learning that. We don't normally see ourselves so that's part of what this course is trying to trust on everyone. She wants your hands raised.  >> Gokul Vasudevan S: Thank you. >> SIVANS: Give us any side projects that you can recommend apart from these, that will  help us more build our skill, or learn from some place or somewhere for website, where you >> Anand S: A",
  "or somewhere for website, where you >> Anand S: A several where do I begin?  Okay, if you want one right now or a bunch right now then.  >> ANDREW DAVID RATNAM SATHIADASS: I have I have two three projects, I'm working on, I don't know, I would need help but no one comes up so maybe I can just ask here. Is that okay? >> Anand S: When you post it in the comment.  >> ANDREW DAVID RATNAM SATHIADASS: Discord. I was okay, I wasn't coming.  >> Anand S: give it a shot but that is an interesting",
  "S: give it a shot but that is an interesting challenge to  what is it? Take to build a community is, therefore useful learning to explore Andrew. So do give give it a shot. Um, but one of the things that you could try, which will certainly be making its way into the next. course, the next iteration of TDS is Gemini's image. Native image editing capability.  So on Gemini, AI studio, you can edit an image. So here's a project which will actually be useful for me. Can you come up with an exercise?",
  "useful for me. Can you come up with an exercise?  That students can solve and that we can validate using Llms that involves image APIs. A variety of these will be. Pretty interesting and useful. That's one example.  another that's going to make its way into the next term is DBT. DBT is about. Data engineering. can we for instance, using DBT, scrape partly and pull data into a duck dB pipe into a duck DB database as a pipeline. Is yet another example.  Right. Okay, I'll stop here. I have a large",
  "Right. Okay, I'll stop here. I have a large bunch. I this time. I haven't given out bonus assignments. Mainly because  The workload, I guess people felt was high, but once Project 2 is done before your in terms, I do have a few bonus assignments, plant that you can work on as projects.  Okay, don't see any questions in the chat either? So oh yes, himanshi in the script. This got to be some way I can share this, let me do one thing. I'll pass the script to the instructors who can post it on",
  "the script to the instructors who can post it on discourse.  What will be have for the tedious and some examples will guide you through it  Traditionally, the N term has been easy far easier than most other exams. This time it will not be much of an exception.  So, how should we study? If you've been following up to now, you may not need to study much, but the TS will get  Key of carton, If this nothing else, should we call it a day? >> Carlton D'Silva: Yeah, we can do. So thanks Anand for.",
  "D'Silva: Yeah, we can do. So thanks Anand for.  Helping us out with all the queries. so, We look forward to. Releasing project one soon. So, Great. >> Anand S: Thank you. Sorry about that. Okay? And just a Peter has a question.  >> JOSEN PIO PETER: Yeah. Hello sir.  >> Anand S: Yes.  >> JOSEN PIO PETER: Yeah, so that I had a request coming in. I just wanted to ask if you could  consider taking Project one scores, also, for internal eligibility. I had a personal issue in this matter because",
  "I had a personal issue in this matter because  when I submitted G3 in J4, it was actually able to see recent saves on that day. But later on, when I discovered the  intern eligibility, I founded that it showed and unsubmitted status and both the G is  didn't have any recently so I, yeah, I mentioned this problem with sir and he said that it such an issue could not be present because  in your dashboard, you would in your database, you surely, see your recent shapes but I didn't see any of them.",
  "your recent shapes but I didn't see any of them. So I just wanted to  >> Anand S: God.  >> JOSEN PIO PETER: Yeah, so I want to know if the, if a lady will approxley considering GA schools as taking Project don't score for intermedability was a possible option so that I don't know. I don't have to register for the course again and pay the fee again.  >> Anand S: understand that the fee will be a burden and I totally appreciate that yourself. Short answer is no but this may be a blessing in this",
  "answer is no but this may be a blessing in this case.  If your scores are on the borderline, I do believe that you will benefit from  the iteration. The fee is I completely agree. Something that will without doubt plays a bird, but the answer is unfortunately not  >> JOSEN PIO PETER: Yeah, yes. >> Anand S: A question to Andrew and also to Himanshi & others. You had requested the scraping The Insider Intelligence video, that's what's pasted why up paste bin, which is service where you can just",

  "[Music] yeah okay probably we receive another mail on student so ver verification email has been send to your school email address right let's look [Music] at okay here it is so I navigate to this link and it should be able to verify now I a student [Music] [Music] it's taking a lot of time veryy okay now it's loading H so now we can see that we are uh it's saying that take advant AG of your academic status and I guess now we have to start this kind of quiz protect your account please solve",
  "kind of quiz protect your account please solve this puzzle so that we are know we able to know that you're real person all right so let's start the puzzle uh match the number of rocks with the number left okay yeah so this is another type of capture which you'll be able to have you have will have to pass all right so academic status has been successfully verified let's continue and here we have it I think it's been activated so can you go back to that tab where I think it's it's doing something",
  "that tab where I think it's it's doing something the tab is still that one no it's not yeah so just refresh this tab I think done okay what's the time limit of this education pack uh it's one year okay it's one year you will and it gets renewed after one year so you you get 100 credits for one year and then after one year it will get renewed so is it free for life kind of thing uh that I don't know if your student account is not active ah okay okay then it might not okay so just like in DDS we",
  "then it might not okay so just like in DDS we have by the way guys are you able to hear our voice in an echo is that a case anyone just answer this are you able to hear our voice in a kind of echo or is it fine okay it's fine so uh just like in uh s you have those API tokens right so just like that in Azure you have about $100 worth of credit so you have to use you can use them and this is for the entire year okay and then it will get renewed if your email if your student email ID is is valid",
  "your email if your student email ID is is valid up to that point okay so let's complete these uh other credential is asking us for and okay I enter it's optional um uh don't have Deli over here a yeah here it is it's n city of right e all right so I think that we are all set our account has been activated yeah I think so J what do you think is this what we are expecting can you go back to the previous tab previous page [Music] [Music] yeah so available credits it is showing right yeah yeah so",
  "credits it is showing right yeah yeah so this is you have got 100 credits yeah all right so I guess we are all set and uh yes so what's next yeah now I will share my screen and I will uh show how you can I mean I this is for just just how you can Avail the student P education P for sure and that to you don't have to uh give any proof just use email address and it will be activated immediately [Music] so I will instead of aure I will be doing it on digital ocean uh which is similar to Aon itself",
  "digital ocean uh which is similar to Aon itself uh digital ocean oh should be over here yeah so I already have one droplet that I created tomorrow and I think it should be running right now yeah it's been running right now [Music] so can I buy tab from that money because I really need it you no all right I will now create a droplet droplet is just a virtual machine that we can create on Azure as well so if I go to uh Azure portal like this is very weird okay so over here we have option for",
  "very weird okay so over here we have option for creating virtual machines and then uh this is how we can create a virtual machine on Azure and we can select different options so this is azure for a student the one which we had created and then in Resource Group I created one Resource Group yesterday and we can name it anything and over here imagine these things and then these are uh the number of uh CPUs and then Rams and these things so you can go over here and then you can select these",
  "can go over here and then you can select these different options I think for this project uh yeah riic so there is something called Azure education pack which you can Avail using your student email address and you don't have to give any uh authent like you don't even have to provide any location or something like that so yeah just give your student email address and it will get activated immediately no it won't detect any money from your account anyway you haven't uh given any credit card or",
  "anyway you haven't uh given any credit card or anything right so how can it detect any money so this is how you can select so these are different options for virtual machines so rather than doing it on I mean I will show you how you can do it on droplet which is digital ocean you can replicate the same thing by using aure virtual machine as well so Bangalore open to and then this is the version and then this is BAS basic plan and let me use the regular one what is there in the premium one see",
  "regular one what is there in the premium one see it is called Azure education Pack huh yeah your education pack so it uses one GB of RAM and then one CPU and then 25 GBS of SSD and I don't need backup and these things at the moment and then it should be password pasted let me create one password the password will be okay and I just need to create one droplet and tags we don't have to do any tagging or these things so just create it is it the same one yeah this is the same one so right now it's",
  "one yeah this is the same one so right now it's been working on this so while it is working on this what I will do is I will create One Directory project to dig o CD project to and I will initialize just just one thing sorry I joined late so you already have logged into the VM on Microsoft Azure uh like no I haven't created Microsoft aure thing I I have just shown you how you can get Microsoft this student developer pag and these 100 okay okay okay okay okay I I'll refer to the recording data",
  "okay okay okay I I'll refer to the recording data okay thank you yeah so right now I'm trying to do everything on a digital ocean which can be uh the same thing can be done on Azure as well by just creating a machine so I have created this machine [Music] [Music] and now I have logged in into that machine so now what I will do is I will create uh I will create one docker uh file from my local system and then I will uh pull that file over here and then I will run that uh file in this uh virtual",
  "then I will run that uh file in this uh virtual machine that I created on digital ocean say start so it should be let's call it index. by let me create fast AP server and for running that let me use uorn uh let me copy it from G to itself I don't remember what was the way to import things yeah this is a hole I can copy and I can paste it over here and now let me execute this server so bash UV run index. Pi open and okay now it's been running so everything is working fine now I will create a",
  "so everything is working fine now I will create a Docker container using this so I will just set up the docker [Music] thing and the things that I need is UV I will need and uh along with UV I will need to copy this particular file into the working directory and then I need to execute this file using UV so and this will get the UV after getting the UV I will set up the working directory and then I will copy index. pi to the working directory and then I will run the command and let me first test",
  "then I will run the command and let me first test it out uh what was the command to build Docker I think pman build hyphen t for creating a tag and what should we call it test test and then dot for current working directory h test and then dot yeah it should work and let me run that image whichever uh first let us have a look at that image ID so I think this is the one that we have just created here Port man run and then we need to give Port mapping which is 8,000 to 8,000 and then name of the",
  "which is 8,000 to 8,000 and then name of the image and I rather ID of the image which should be this one okay my laptop have [Music] stuck and now it should run the same application yeah it's been running it now what I will do is I will push this image to dockerhub so I don't remember the command for pushing the image to dockerhub I think it should be in G2 again so we need to talker push and then all right mod man push uh let me first print out all name of all the images p man push 959 and",
  "out all name of all the images p man push 959 and this rest of the thing and then doer. IU that is because I want to push it to Docker and then my this should be fine and then uh test one or something and then let's give it a tag of latest unauthorized I think I need to authorize it [Music] are already l so it should be able to push it then [Music] yeah it's Z 18 and let me have a look at dockerhub okay I think it have deed yeah it have it have been deployed and it's 59 MP5 okay and what about",
  "been deployed and it's 59 MP5 okay and what about this one this is 105 MB file all right so now what I will do is I will pull this image over here so I will again have to in first I will have so this is uh newly created virtual machine so it won't be having pman so we'll need to install pman first for yeah I think it stuck or what happened I don't know [Music] uh this is a bit slow I will just use my art terminal itself to connect to it so I think it should be SSH and then I'm using it as an",
  "it should be SSH and then I'm using it as an root and after that I need to get IP address oh I need to give the password so it should be one so this is the password that I have set up while creating this droplet so which I think I think it can be changed from here reset root password in case if you want to change it later so now I have got access to the same machine and earlier I was trying to install podman okay it have installed pman I guess yeah pman is available wman login registry must be",
  "pman is available wman login registry must be provided [Music] uh there is some configuration file that I need to change but I exactly don't know what was the name of that configuration file so I will just use this thing and why does it get this error that is another thing [Music] okay uh let me use this then specify the registry yeah uh we need to get from docker.io and username is J 18 and password I will get that password account settings personal access token generate personal access token",
  "access token generate personal access token and okay on description test two or something generate copy past it here suddenly stop oh this machine is activate at the moment okay now I need to give and pman P man pull I think I have already authenticated so I just need to pull it uh from there and this should be the and I need to pull the latest one no qualify um [Music] oh [Music] uh was it this line or some other line okay I will just ask GPT to do this it will add two lines that will allow",
  "to do this it will add two lines that will allow doer. IU or else I can also specify specifically yeah this is what we can do at the moment [Music] H reading manifest unknown uh maybe it's not a clean installation so install man I can again do it done [Music] uh J if you want to use if you want to reinstall the application you have to use app [Music] and I need to put you have to put Dunder reinstall you can't just say install reinstall a package Dunder Dunder or hyph iph sorry sorry [Music]",
  "Dunder Dunder or hyph iph sorry sorry [Music] hyph re uh reinstall or is it install reinstall yeah yeah install yeah iPhone iPhone reinstall and then application I think reason why it's not working is because earlier I was running it inside Google uh this chrome and then suddenly it failed and then I closed that window that might be the reason and still it's getting this error I don't know why this is weird error uh let me try to pull it again and I think it won't work okay let me try to get",
  "and I think it won't work okay let me try to get some other image that is already which I have already tested so that there is so that I can identify if it is something that is wrong with okay it again gets the same error reading manifest latest in this thing manifest on I don't know what is that the means Theory and the latest tag is not available check available tags so latest tag is already available and let me Lo in again J you made a spelling mistake it's you put last test instead of",
  "mistake it's you put last test instead of latest it says trying to pull last test okay but this is the correct one L EST oh yeah yeah no but if you look at the the one that you were trying to do just it says L okay let me try this yeah now it's been working okay what is wrong with this image then the one which I just created because I tested it on my local machine yeah maybe you might just have to recreate that one and try again there was some issues when you were creating it right uh yeah",
  "issues when you were creating it right uh yeah there might be some issues but yeah so this image that I'm I have just uh pulled it is kind of same uh it doesn't have much differences so if I run this image Forman run and I think I need to use the same port mapping 8,000 to 8,000 and then uh image ID right and now if I need to access it uh where is that I can copy this and I print 8,000 to it and it gets uh this result okay but uh but uh let's say now you're working on this project and let us",
  "say now you're working on this project and let us say you make some change over here like for some reason it's not been working uh I can go to the earlier one which was working was it was it this one uh index and then I think this is the one let's see yeah this is the one oh not Cod dot it should be code Insiders uh so this one which I was working on uh last uh yesterday I was working on this and let me show you what is difference between this one so over here I have already configured git so",
  "one so over here I have already configured git so if I show you g remote hyph V I guess it will show which repository it is uh related to okay now let us say if I make any change to this let me go back here and uh this is one droplet that I just created and then this is the other one that I created yesterday so it is pointing to this droplet so if I change this uh so it prints hello Minal right now what I can do is I can change this message let me call it hello or culton and let me um push it",
  "me call it hello or culton and let me um push it to GitHub minus M and then this is this message and then get push origin mean now I have just pushed it to GitHub right but uh right now okay okay okay first it will take some time but what it will do is it will update it over here itself why it will take some time uh let me show you so if I go this is the one that I created yesterday and in this one if I go to actions H it is running some action over here and what it is doing is if I go to",
  "over here and what it is doing is if I go to workflows this is Docker CI okay so over here on every push or any pull request okay if uh Calton or Charan or somebody from a student side if someone have created a poll request and uh in that case also this workflow would run and then what it will do is it will first log into dockerhub so I have kept few secrets for this repo I will just show you how you can create Secrets uh you just go to settings and then over here go to uh secret and variables",
  "and then over here go to uh secret and variables and then actions and here you can create uh these secrets so create one secret for docker username and then create one secret for Docker password this is for storing username of your Docker profile and then this one is for uh personal access token okay so those things you already have now you are trying to log to Docker hub using that password uh that username and password after logging in what we are doing is we have uh this one our Docker file",
  "are doing is we have uh this one our Docker file this is the one that I just showed you over here okay so it is the same Docker file which which is using UV over here then it is setting up the working directory and then it is copying index. pi and then it is just executing that file so it is using this uh this Docker file for building it okay and once it builds that what it will do is it will push it to test repo and it will use secret. Docker username so which is my username so where it will",
  "username so which is my username so where it will push it will push to test repo and uh where is that and with latest tag okay so over here this is the test repo and it have already pushed it U see right now it's 2 minutes ago right I haven't pushed anything it's been pushed by this GitHub action so it will push to GitHub action and then what is happening is yeah it have pushed it and later what it is doing is within the same droplet uh the same one where I where I am running this VM this one",
  "one where I where I am running this VM this one so right now if I again refresh it it will show hello Calton but I haven't done anything with the um droplet VM I even haven't logged in into that VM it's uh this is some other VM okay this is not not the one uh which I am showing right right now this is what I created yesterday and I didn't even login into that VM but still I was able to uh change the code inside that that is because of uh this GitHub action so it sent a push uh sorry post",
  "GitHub action so it sent a push uh sorry post request to this particular endpoint web hook inside this VM so now let me Lo uh log into this VM and I will show you what is there so SSH root at the rate and then this is the one and password is this one so now I have logged in into that and uh and uh this is the one which I am using okay so if I show you cat new so this is one which is no not this one uh where was I running that let me use history command grap UV run yeah this is the one web hook",
  "command grap UV run yeah this is the one web hook server let me show you what is there or other than cat let's use Bim so it have this web book endpoint so it just sends a post request to this webbook endpoint and this is the uh this is where the request comes and then container name is uh vigilent Shaha so how I am get getting this is when I first created this container it had a name of V uh viland Shaha so I just kept the same name you can even uh give a custom name to container okay and then",
  "uh give a custom name to container okay and then right over here we are trying to pull the image that was pushed to uh Docker Hub and then we are uh stopping the earlier running container and then we are removing that container and here we are uh running the New Image and which is in dispatch mode so in background we are running the New Image and we are giving it a name of uh the custom name we are giving it a custom name so that we can uh later stop that container and then we can even remove",
  "stop that container and then we can even remove that container this is for uh uniqueness I mean so so that we can I mean otherwise what will happen is it will randomly uh generate a name and because of which we won't be able to stop these containers and then remove these containers so they will keep on using resources so this is how the new image gets pulled and then the older container will be stopped and then it will be removed from the machine and then new uh image will be re deployed in the",
  "and then new uh image will be re deployed in the container so this is how New Image will be used for running that container uh so does anyone have doubt on this [Music] actually I I would bus in some other can you like summarize what you did in like a minute uh yeah sure okay so first I created this uh droplet on uh digital ocean which is a virtual machine you can create it on azure okay and once I created this uh this droplet what I did is I have uh written whole code on my local machine okay",
  "uh written whole code on my local machine okay yes yes and then I create a Docker file using which I build uh I I mean yeah first I build the docker image and then I manually put uh so I buil that Docker image and then I pushed it to Docker Hub and then I went to that droplet and then I tried to pull it okay and then after pulling I just uh run that particular Docker image this is manual way of doing it every time you do this thing but then later what I did is I created the this index. Pi I",
  "what I did is I created the this index. Pi I created this do file and then I just pushed it to GitHub and from GitHub I have on GitHub I have created one uh GitHub actions and what it does is it logins to Docker Hub and then it builds the image using the docker file that we uh pushed and then it pushes that image to Docker Hub okay so now we have updated the image this workflow runs when every time we push yeah on every push on or on pull request okay or every push or P request it rebuilds the",
  "okay or every push or P request it rebuilds the image and deploys yeah it rebuilds the image and deploys the image and after doing that we have this trigger point so so this this is why why are we doing this uh so that those changes can be pulled inside the virtual machine the drop okay okay so what I'm doing is I'm uh pinging this we are we are we are creating our own cicd situation here yeah we are creating our own uh cicd pipeline so this will send a post request to our uh droplet on 5000",
  "send a post request to our uh droplet on 5000 and over there I am just uh so this is where is the code for that I think this is the one so over here on this web hook endpoint I'm keeping consistent uh container name this vigilent Shaha okay and then I'm pulling the new changes that we just pushed and then we are stopping the current container and then we are removing the current container and then we are running the New Image okay and by keeping the container name consistent yeah so this",
  "the container name consistent yeah so this reduces a workflow of like going uh to the like logining into the droplet and then uh pulling that Docker image and then rebuilding so it does everything by itself just by doing it get committed get push it will do [Music] everything the same can be replicated on Azure as well like on any VM on Azure there is one more service like I think there should be some container service um yesterday I was exploring yeah so over here you can create a container",
  "yeah so over here you can create a container registry uh just as we used to create container registry on dockerhub and then uh you can use this container instance and I don't exactly know how to do this but I was reading through some uh documentation I mean I haven't tried that that's the thing I was thinking to try but uh I could not get time to tr uh how to deploy Docker container to azure so yeah this is the one I think it have four or five steps create a resource and then what is this next",
  "create a resource and then what is this next step uh creating a container then teing streams so from local machine you just build the image and then using azour C Li it can be pushed to container registry and then a some workflow is there for directly building I for just using Azure itself and then other way to do is using vir virtual machine and then do something similar to what I have done on a digital ocean okay and what happens is whenever okay let me create one service over here um let me",
  "let me create one service over here um let me first check if uh 10,000 Port is running running uh whm new service. pi and it have 10,000 port and let me just check if this port is running or not there is only one thing that I need to check oh sorry not, yeah it's not been running so what I will do is I will now run it UV run new service dop and I will push it to background and now it should be running yeah it is running and now if I just close this connection right now it's still running right",
  "connection right now it's still running right but after some time it will stop running I think it won't stop running because I have already created one instance of yeah I already have one instance of screen so let me have a look at screen screen is something that allows you to run things on in background so let's have a look at PS foreground uh there is nothing in background but this is still been running so what I will do is screen hyph R and then I will use this one 68 and I will just stop",
  "then I will use this one 68 and I will just stop this one I will exit from screen terminal and is it running is not right now it's still running so at the moment there is no shocket so I think 8,000 should not be running uh it's also running H 8,000 is running because it is no no it should not run okay is running like in background there is no toask and Screen also we don't have anything at the moment okay let me exit now and let me try to access 10,000 once more yeah now it have stopped",
  "access 10,000 once more yeah now it have stopped running that is because I have disconnected from uh SSH connection so now it's no more accessible so now if I log in again let me check if it is accessible and now it's not not accessible now if I use UV run and new service. Pi uh then it will start the server service okay and then if I just uh stop it it will stop okay which is expected Behavior but if I execute it in background and now if I close the connection yeah now it it won't work uh that",
  "the connection yeah now it it won't work uh that is because it have that is because SSH connection is no more active so what we can do in this Cas is I think I have typed wrong password yeah what we can do in this case is we will create a screen instance so screen is like even when we log out it will still be running in that VM the services will still be running so I will create a screen terminal and then I will use UV run new service. pi and now I will use control A and D and it's still been",
  "I will use control A and D and it's still been running inside that and now I will just exit and now I have uh break the connection and it's still running and it will keep on running it will never [Music] stop so using a screen you can run uh things in uh another shell and um J I have a suggestion you're using uvon right to run the uh uh HTTP server yeah I'm using uvon uh I think what happens is uvon as default Behavior it uh because you're not running it as a background task it automatically",
  "running it as a background task it automatically when you log out it uh shuts down the server uh whereas there is an option uh called no uh no o hu and then if you Su I have tried yesterday so does it not work no no it didn't it didn't work did you try it with the um uh sending the uh what you call with the Amper at the end of the that also I have tried that also won't work oh it doesn't work yesterday I was chatting with the perplexity and it gave me three four Solutions I tried each of these",
  "me three four Solutions I tried each of these and then this is the one which worked okay and it is very easy to uh use as well yeah Okay and like now if I log in again one okay and now I have logged in again and by doing a screen hyphen LS it will show all these uh detached shell so I can go back to them by doing screen hyph R and then uh this ID or whatever we want to call it and then we can go back over here and then if you want to detach then control A and D now it is running in background",
  "control A and D now it is running in background okay so that is it regarding uh this deployment part so just create one VM so you can use Azure because it provides on insute education pack you can get 100 uh credits for free and that to you don't have to give a credit card or debit card so this is preferable way and create one VM uh by clicking over the these buttons and then same way uh you I mean right right now yeah you can use the same workflow so I have this workflow it is uploading on our",
  "so I have this workflow it is uploading on our Docker and then it is having this public IP and then it will pull the newly created image over there so same workflow you can create for Azure as well okay so Shan you can take over from week seven and does anyone have doubt before that in whatever I have done so far yeah so um normally when you run a Linux Service as a proper service then usually use system d as well oh yeah system D I mean yeah yeah yesterday perplexity suggested something uh",
  "yeah yesterday perplexity suggested something uh some something related to system D but I didn't try that okay okay maybe we can try that not not in today's session but we can try that uh after session yeah after session yeah because that would be like a proper way of doing it you know because if you're running a service that's supposed to run in the background on the server and that's system D should help yeah okay sir uh just one thing uh why do we need as your student pack uh is it uh not",
  "do we need as your student pack uh is it uh not working on versel to deploy the app uh so versel won't be sufficient for deploying the application okay sir so we have to create the uh this type of virtual machine to deploy our project uh yeah yeah okay thank sir all right sh you can take all right guys so uh we'll be discussing about uh uh G7 now and let's get started deadline for G7 is 26 for G7 uh I guess it's 27 it's 26th okay okay okay so guys is my screen visible yes it anyone just yeah",
  "guys is my screen visible yes it anyone just yeah okay so let's get started so uh in G7 all we have is this entire week has been dedicated to visualizations okay and uh we'll be going through each and every of these uh subtopics one by one uh the thing is that I covered much of these topics not much uh some of these topics in the previous s is so for example this forecasting in Excel was covered there uh animation so this is one of those uh videos where you have been taught to create a running",
  "where you have been taught to create a running bar chart using PowerPoint so that's one thing that you can learn but uh I this is one thing that you can learn but I won't suggest you to learn okay because because there are multiple other uh softwares which are nowadays used for creating R running bars running bar so I won't recommend you guys to go ahead with this technique of creating these running parts so just use a much more advanced software like uh flourish or I guess we have something in",
  "like uh flourish or I guess we have something in Tableau as well if I'm not wrong so use those kinds of tools rather than using PowerPoint for creating animations like this okay so uh let me check once again so we will be starting with flourish today and uh okay so this networking data with kumu was also completed in the last session so if you guys are curious you can just go ahead and okay uh all right next one is visualizing charts with Excel uh okay so this is a pretty basic one uh we can",
  "uh okay so this is a pretty basic one uh we can skip that as well uh data Vis SE on this was completed as well next is Google charts okay so this is under construction gu this one is as well uh okay so next is after Network resolation so this is just a kind of uh kind of M what have they created you can to not much C okay like the animation is it related to that or not okay okay we are doing nwork visualization and how is this related this video this particular video related Tok have you",
  "video this particular video related Tok have you watched this video no no I have yet to watch so the thing is that this is just a kind of rant on uh Govinda who claimed that he was first uh first nomin for this role of playing a character in avar movie so you just watch it you will realize that it's just a rant and a kind of a fun video to watch okay uh there we are just showing you how it it can be possible that goind might have been related to James Cameron and it's the probability of them",
  "to James Cameron and it's the probability of them definitely definitely yeah just just just give it a it's a pretty fun video to watch okay okay so the next one is raw graphs uh we'll be looking into that as well uh next is data storytelling so that is something which you can learn from this particular video uh where uh you will be learning that how you can create visualizations and then how you can spin all those visualizations into a really great story then tell it to your audience okay uh",
  "great story then tell it to your audience okay uh next one is interactive okay we'll be going through this marimo as well this is a pretty interesting topic to be honest and next is narratives with Excel okay this is again uh creating dashboards in Excel and next is narratives with comic so this is going to be a interesting topic as well okay I'll be I'll be creating using this tool for the first time with you guys as well okay so let's see what this to can do all right so let's started with",
  "this to can do all right so let's started with flourish today and uh uh here it is so let me just search flourish and let's have a look into it flourish in Python just flourish uh here it is all right so flourish is basically a data Vis you should do it's I would say it's a much Advanced tool than uh softwares like tblo and it allows you to create multiple visualizations in like it will allow you to create multiple modern looking at visualizations as well so let's have a look at it so let's",
  "as well so let's have a look at it so let's create a new visualization I have a data set ready with me and first let's have a look at the DAT as why not okay so here it is uh uh there it is so this is the data set where uh we have multiple countries present and the population of Indians present in those countries okay so this data set I scrapped from Wikipedia and yeah so we have these countries we which are being uh which have been sorted by the number of Indians in in their population okay so",
  "number of Indians in in their population okay so let's create different visualizations with these with this data okay so let's have a look uh it is here it is okay so let's create a new visualization and now you can see that flourish offers you an entire catalog of charts to choose from okay you can see that there are multiple Advanced charts which are currently being used in uh in the in the industry and you can see that we have these uh stream graphs area BM charts there are multiple really",
  "graphs area BM charts there are multiple really interesting charts you can use we have projection Maps where uh we have multiple ways to create a you know a geographical map of something of of a data we have Scatter Plots you can see that okay we have 3D maps as well we have pictograms uh if you guys can remember that pictogram was something which was introduced to us way back in our school uh where uh demonstrate frequency with pictures so that's something that you can use as well you can use",
  "something that you can use as well you can use these marker Maps as well we have mult so you can see that this is kind of a store locator map present over here you can explore this as well and then again we have this bar chart L right so just as just like I said instead of creating a bar chart Race using PowerPoint which is I would say uh not so good method to do and it will require it consume a lot of your time just create one with flourish use modern technology instead of relying on Old TOS",
  "modern technology instead of relying on Old TOS okay by the way PowerPoint is not made for creating these kind of things so it was just a kind of trick using the morph transition to achieve this okay so next is hierarchy you can use hierarchy charts uh these different types of charts as well so we have cards as well as you can see that uh we have really attractive cards present over here so perhaps you can create pamphlets and uh some kinds of posture in flourish as well networking graphs are",
  "posture in flourish as well networking graphs are present Radars tables 3D gr so just go ahead and explore this uh website you will be I guess you'll be amazed with this all right so what we're going to do is we are going to create a bar chart uh let's see where are ours this here it is we'll be creating this part chart of all these countries uh okay [Music] and yeah here it is so uh as you can see I just opened a new template in flourish and it already has this data present if you want to use",
  "already has this data present if you want to use it go just go ahead and use it otherwise you can upload your own data as well so this by default data is about population in these countries and uh let's upload our Indian diaspora data yeah import it 40 rows were uploaded let's see and here we have our really elaborate part chart present okay so uh as you can see that it's really interactive you can just score over this bar and you will be able to see the number IND okay so this is how you can",
  "to see the number IND okay so this is how you can create visualizations in flish you have an entire menu of customizations you can apply on this chart uh let's check grd of charts okay so we at ler Studio as well what a Google looker Studio or data Studio yeah I'll be demonstrating that as well okay yeah so uh here we have animations you can create different kinds of animations with them uh this is is uh it's not moving so I guess we have to create our raise bar chart for that okay so you can",
  "our raise bar chart for that okay so you can just go ahead and explore this let's change color first okay so you can uh just go ahead and explore this and uh yeah uh okay so this was for flourish any questions in flourish or should we move ahead anyone any questions all right so let's move ahead uhuh it seems easy yeah it's pretty we just just upload the data we just choose the template and we publish yeah absolutely absolutely it's pretty easy okay so let's move ahead and so this kumu was done",
  "so let's move ahead and so this kumu was done uh visualizing charts using Excel is pretty easy as well just watch this wonderful video and you'll be able to get a hang of it okay next is seon I demonstrated this in the previous lecture uh okay soog data studio uh okay and next is raw graphs okay so let's have a look at this raw graphs so uh raw graph is another tool you can use for visualizations it's just like uh flourish uh let's have a look at it uh let so over here what do is uhhuh it's",
  "at it uh let so over here what do is uhhuh it's free and open source yeah yeah it's free and open source that's pretty good yeah so uh one thing which is really good with raw graphs is that you can simp you don't have to upload a data over here you just have to copy and paste it it you just copy any data from any kind of spreadsheets and paste it over here so as you can see that it automatically generated this table for okay so this is a really good thing and uh uh okay so this is good and so",
  "good thing and uh uh okay so this is good and so what we have to do next we have to create a bar chart so and and you can see that we are being giving this these kind of steps as well so load your data the next step is choose your chart so it's going to be a bar chart because the thing is that with this kind of data you can only create a bar chart you can create multiple other uh visualizations as well no doubt you can create a pie chart as well but that would be a hideous pie chart can we like",
  "but that would be a hideous pie chart can we like use it like can we expose the visualization or do we like how does that happen yeah you can exp you can expose this Vis as well I guess there is a there is an option of I think people using newspapers are using this to make visualizations uh what are using this newspapers seem to be using this possi possibly it's open source why not use it right yeah absolutely you can create these visualizations moreover one thing which I forgot to show you in",
  "moreover one thing which I forgot to show you in flourish that uh I tried to create that uh that Indian diaspora chart in using this map resolution as well so as you can see that this is the exactly same data which I copy pasted and you can see that it has created this uh map and you can see really clearly that the highest number of individuals uh it's not able to grft the USA because it should be United States of America this is one thing that you have to keep in mind that the names of these",
  "you have to keep in mind that the names of these countries should be exactly what uh their official name is okay now I guess it should be yeah now it's working so earli it was just written United States that's why it's it was not able to understand which kind of which country are we talking about so that's one thing that you have to keep in mind otherwise if you have uh let's say if you have different names for if you want to avoid this just just pass uh look just pass the latitudes and",
  "just pass uh look just pass the latitudes and longitudes that would be much more convenient let's look at this visualization now and as you can see that the United States is present over here and it's deep in blue the next highest Contender is obviously the UAE right and uh there is and you can see that this entire spread of Indians on this right you can see it on France as well this particular country which country it is because it's New Zealand okay so this is done and uh let's uh resume with",
  "okay so this is done and uh let's uh resume with RS okay uh okay so it's done I have to create a bar chart where is a bar chart let's create a yeah here it is bar fine let's create it uh the third step is mapping and in this step you have to map your Fields with the places with the kind of uh what I can say with a you know you have to map each and every field and how you're going to use it all right so uh we be using the bar should be dependent on the population of Indians fine we are able to",
  "on the population of Indians fine we are able to see this bar chart over here and the okay so I guess the it should be over here instead and this should be over here and no it requires a numerical value instead so the country should be by color I guess uh this is it a series um let's check for this well population of Indian should be right over here but again it's it's considering it like uh histogram kind of right [Music] and is this the right chart is right it's not working pretty well uh all",
  "is right it's not working pretty well uh all right uh well you got a grasp of grasp of what I was explaining to you so you can just drag your columns and drop it over here and then it will be able to create that those visualizations and you can see that it creates those visualizations in real time right so if I just remove it from here you can see that the color is gone fine and then you can customize this bar chart as well to your heart's content and then you can export it as a PNG jpg or a",
  "and then you can export it as a PNG jpg or a raw graphs extension and also an SVG okay so if I guess SVG are uh uh just a second guys uh am I audible now hello just a second just a actually my earphones got disconnected all right let now all right fine so uh you can so if I'm not wrong you can create you can uh embed an SVG file in your websites as well in HTML as well so if you are able to make these visualizations and then download it as an SVG then you can put that you can embed that SVG in",
  "then you can put that you can embed that SVG in your website so that's pretty good uh SVG you can and it's l okay so you can embed your svgs in your website as well so that's pretty powerful okay so uh this completes this raw graph uh portion anyone having any doubts guys anyone having any doubts uh fine so so let's move ahead uh and now let's have a look at looker Studio okay so so look at Lucas Studio Lucas stud but it has been a long time I it has been a long time I used now and now let's",
  "it has been a long time I used now and now let's have a look at it okay so let's create a blank report hold hold let's create this uh let's have a look at these templates instead okay so there are some errors it's not able to load the well uh ah fine so as you can see that uh this studio is a kind of visualization tool just like powerbi uh I guess so yeah so you can create these visualizations so as you can see that this is lot more powerful and way cheaper yeah so powerbi is uh if you guys",
  "and way cheaper yeah so powerbi is uh if you guys don't know powerbi so it's a Microsoft created it's a tool created by Microsoft and uh you can create various types of visualizations and uh you can you can make uh transformations in your data as well you can create new Fields as well so that's pretty powerful and now rck is claiming that uh uh looker studio is way more powerful than that so you can so you can just assume the power of looker Studio okay so uh as you can see that this is a",
  "Studio okay so uh as you can see that this is a dashboard which has been created by someone this is just a template dashboard and you can see that it has multiple visualizations present over so the entire essence of a dashboard is that you'll be having multiple visualizations present and they should be connected using a filter with each other okay so let's say I want to only see India so I just want to see the data of India I'm not sure that uh which kind of data are we looking at but uh you",
  "which kind of data are we looking at but uh you can see that these charts changed when I clicked over India so let's say if I want to include the United States as well let's click over here and you can see that these visualizations has been updated right so now we are only able to see United States and India present over here and all these different visualizations are reacting to the changes where we we are making in these filters right you can uh play with this device category as well let's uh",
  "play with this device category as well let's uh just just check for desktop okay so you can see that uh uh this is a textop and the only this is the only data which is available for text drops in United States and India uh let's uh go ahead with all countries and then you'll be able to see a lot more diversity present over you can see uh yeah you can see that these Impressions have over right so uh this is a kind of dashboard you can create in ler studio and moreover you can see these textual",
  "ler studio and moreover you can see these textual uh data implications as well you can see that these impressions are changing whenever we are changing let's say I want to see for Germany you can see that only 129 179 Impressions were there and it's decreasing at the moment so this is the power of ler Studio I have used power VI in uh in my past and it was a pretty good tool as well but uh seriously you should give it you should give it a try you should give a try to Lucas to do as well uh also",
  "should give a try to Lucas to do as well uh also we can I guess we can change the dates as well so that is it is a pretty good dashboard let's check yeah we are able to do that as well so uh you can see that we have multiple other res reacting to it so it's a pretty good dashboard to be honest and uh just go ahead and play with this particular the biggest biggest biggest part in Google is you can collaborate it's collaboration first it can be open any system choose about installing any software",
  "any system choose about installing any software it is openly available uh unless you need something too Advance you have to take a subscription and that is also reasonable yeah so just like rck said that you can even collaborate on Luca studio with others and it's pretty good so uh that was uh it about loc I guess I should show you by creating a visualization look at it a blank report and uh yes to all fine so let's create this why is okay okay why is it giving me these marketing preferences",
  "why is it giving me these marketing preferences one again ah okay now it's working I just have to click on that cross button cross F so let's try and create a visualization let add a data yeah it's pretty annoying add it won't annoy you anymore no it's just I just clicked on yes to all and it has saved it prob Scroll once and then yeah I've done it I scrolled this is the end of it and I've clicked on yes to then it's just popping it again and again it's pretty annoying okay thanks please",
  "and again it's pretty annoying okay thanks please continue okay it's this it's pretty weird for Studio to just keep on poing this particular thing I guess it's kind of a bug this website add data data it's working yeah I guess do you have any idea why how should I get rid of this see I I usually do not get right so I do not you have to actually probably select the no buttons and then actually confirm that that's what you want to do selected these no buttons but there there is no option for this",
  "no buttons but there there is no option for this cross now see this reload maybe because I've been observing some weird stuff with Google lately that it is taking time with updates like anything I push right even on my workspace server uh for the organization and it it waits for like a minute or two maybe they have too much data now I do not know what is happening exactly but they are getting slow with these minute updates or you see this is sticking you have already pushed this update now you",
  "you have already pushed this update now you have you have said yes to all but it is not reflect after a minute it so so just close it and maybe maybe open a new studio page or just relo this oneic the thing is that before taking the session I was trying with this Lua studio and it was again and again popping up and then even then I clicked on yes to all and even now it's showing me these maybe some issue Then I then then there's some issue let's go ahead with this and let's give it a last Drive",
  "go ahead with this and let's give it a last Drive let's get a new one okay okay okay okay so now it's allowing me to open our data to data file upload and authoriz so I'll be uploading my Indian diaspora data and okay so it's working and it's processing this data so I guess the the problem with was uh with the updation part it was not able to update at the moment okay so it took a lot of time for that and it's expected from Google anyways so let's add this data and uh let's have a look at it",
  "add this data and uh let's have a look at it okay you about to add data from this report okay okay okay don't show me again at report honestly if people uh you know unrelated but like Google's Google Cloud right or any cloud service provider if they just give the option of loading money and then using it lot of new folks will just start experimenting with because the whole thing around credit card is the only thing that dises people yeah absolutely even for me for a long time I wasn't able to",
  "even for me for a long time I wasn't able to access these Technologies because at the time I was I didn't have any access to credit card so that's another thing well let's add a new chart now and let's create a pie chart this time and let's look at uh how this is good let's look okay so this is a pretty hideous pie chart to be honest but you can see the distinctions right uh you can see that uh okay so it it hasn't added each and every country but you can see that for it has took about 1 2 3",
  "but you can see that for it has took about 1 2 3 four five six S8 nine so it has taken about nine countries and then for the 10th one it just summed up all and it look at as an other that's pretty good and you can see uh so the United States is present over here the United so the UA is also present so obviously you can see that the pie chart is not the best option for creating such a visualization let's just delete this one add a new chart and I'll be adding a par chart instead so should be",
  "I'll be adding a par chart instead so should be good and okay so what is this okay it's working with record comp all right and it's working with the record for that should that thing Dimension country is over here add a dimension and population of Indians uh okay got it so now it has created this uh let's see okay so it's present I will be deleting this record value Rec counts let's let's delete this one one of them yeah yeah yeah two Matrix I will delete now and now I should create let's let's",
  "delete now and now I should create let's let's try creating a pie chart once again just for fun ah so this is a pie chart and you can look at these different distinctions because that was the thing I was thinking that how can 79% of uh the others can have 79% of Indians when United States has a gigantic population of Indians present over so that's pretty that was pretty unusual but now you can see that the the reason it was not currently being it was not correctly being presented because we",
  "it was not correctly being presented because we haven't added this metrics this metric uh this field this population of Indian field in this metrics uh panel okay so this is another thing that you can learn that there are two things one is dimension and another is metrics Find dimensions are basically uh there if we are going to say in Layman language then then they are just categorical variables kind of and metrics are the numerical varibles okay so you have to uh add your numerical parameters",
  "so you have to uh add your numerical parameters your numerical fields in the metrix panel and the dimension your categorical fields in dimension that's how you would be able to create your fine so uh this is good and let's create a pass chart as well uh okay we can get G we can create a g chart as well let's have a look at it yeah so it's a pretty good VI chart uh pretty similar to the flourish one uh why has it applied okay okay okay so the thing is that I clicked over here that's why it was",
  "is that I clicked over here that's why it was reacting to it so guys can you see this when I clicked over this uh let let me click over United States for the moment when I click over it you can see that that it it it kind of Applied a filtering over the United States and that reflected in all three of these visualizations so you can see that over in this over here in this map you can see that this filtering was done in this obviously the filtering was done and in the table as well you can see",
  "was done and in the table as well you can see the filtering was done so this is pretty powerful uh let's see let's let's check this one Saudi Arabia if I click over here it should apply this filtering yeah it applied this filtering and you can see that the pie chart responded to it right uh let's check for Japan yeah again it responded so yeah so this is pretty good just uh go ahead and play along with Lucas studio and uh you will have have some fun okay so that was it for Lucas Studio anyone",
  "fun okay so that was it for Lucas Studio anyone having any doubts guys anyone having any doubts or should we move ahead with comic that that's a pretty interesting topic to discuss I think I do not have anys if anybody else has anys and this this filtering thing is known as cross filtering and perhaps the most hello I'm audible yes you're a yeah Ric you said something actually I was distracted for a bit can you please repeat okay so uh in the filtering thing you did you put you click on one",
  "filtering thing you did you put you click on one chart and the other chart app cross filtering yeah okay and this is like very useful you can build multiple absolutely absolutely can drill down without using Code absolutely so uh let's say you are creating a dashboard for your organization and you you can even connect to it to a database okay what you can do you can you can have this you can have either you can use your Google sheet or you can have a full-fledged cloudsql instance on Google",
  "have a full-fledged cloudsql instance on Google Cloud then you can connect that and then uh you can also Connect app sheet then you can have an app deployed on app sheet connect contacting your SQL database and then that reflects almost like with it's it this takes 15 minutes to kind of render the data but uh every 15 minutes you're getting almost real time data if you want that and that's this is perhaps the cheapest solution you can have you can see what rck just said over here as well so you",
  "see what rck just said over here as well so you can connect your app sheets as well you can create you can connect your I guess uh post SQL servers your uh Microsoft SQL servers uh so let's say if you're working with uh about 5,000 yeah yes if you're working with let's say with five lakh row so it's not feasible to use csvs for them okay so five lakh is something which csvs can accommodate let's say you're working with 1 billion L that's something which csvs are not good at okay so you can",
  "which csvs are not good at okay so you can instead so and SQL servers and post servers are pretty good with that so you can upload a post SQL Server as well you can uh use cloud uh servers for that as well so local studio is pretty powerful with all these things right so uh just uh go ahead and uh look into it and you will be able to the biggest thing is like power Pi you have to run locally on your system right you can use largely it's on the system con syst you're constrained by the systems",
  "system con syst you're constrained by the systems resources this is on the cloud absolutely you can have you can have a very basic system that at least has some Ram at least 16 GB Ram then that can run without any even even integrated graphics card works and then you you you could do anything any any visualization without worrying about your Systema absolutely so uh that's the thing so with powerbi you have to you know create these visual additions using the resources of your own device and",
  "using the resources of your own device and it's limited to your system kind of and when we are talking about Lucas studio so these these ORS are being created on the server of Google right so Google is kind of and the Machine where this these varations are being created so that's pretty powerful for sure so even if you have a pretty uh you know if even if you have a pretty low and laptop or desktop you you can create your local Studio you can create pretty good VI with your local studio so",
  "create pretty good VI with your local studio so that's something which is uh you know just uh shattering your uh your chains your it's shattering your chains kind of okay so uh this is a power Lucas studio so I will urge you all to just go ahead and have a look at it fine uh next the thing is uh we are getting started with marimo so this is another really interesting topic I wanted to talk to you guys about by the way guys if you haven't watched this particular video just go ahead and watch it",
  "this particular video just go ahead and watch it okay so marimo is uh kind of startup which was developed by an Indian guy so this guy is actually I guess he was born in the United States but then over there he created but he was Indian by descent and then he created this project with his uh with his friends and now it's pretty powerful now let me just show you how marim works on a side note do you want to do a cloud service with the with with UPI uh based you know cash kind of thing just just",
  "uh based you know cash kind of thing just just upload 100 rupees and run a server for 100 rupees uh yeah so uh well okay so well well to be honest I wasn't able to just said so no no do a do do a startup like TDS team uh TDS students do a startup and we we do a cloud service right uh like uh like this Google cloud and everything so we do our own cloud and then we offer people that instead of giving us your credit card you just load money and then your server runs till your money runs right okay",
  "your server runs till your money runs right okay okay and even have to develop our own thing we could just do a rapper on Google Cloud ORS okay well have to have one thing okay we just do it we do it sta Caron you and anyone who wants we we test this out because I think it will it will work really well especially anyone doing TDS would love it yeah that sounds just put 500 rupees and then 500 Rupees is there it runs right and we we we control the budgeting side on the cloud like we we manage",
  "the budgeting side on the cloud like we we manage the AWS costing like like like any other rapper on it right because I I remember I think shra is there he did something he tried to do something similar but he then he perverted to something else because maybe maybe because he he was getting probably told by Google to not do it uh okay but but yeah so if we do not have any bondage or something like that we we could try something right because see this this was Cosmo Cloud they had this option I",
  "this this was Cosmo Cloud they had this option I saw like thousands of people started using it and if if if we can crack the pricing and everything we that sounds really interesting with and perhaps you can give it a thought as well so yeah okay uh so let's uh get along with this marimo no so the thing with marimo is that marimo is kind of a Jer thing okay let just go to Mari mode and it's a kind of a Jer notebook where uh okay so in this kind so in this kind of notebook the the The Leverage",
  "so in this kind of notebook the the The Leverage which you have the difference which it has with uh juper notebook is that whenever you are making whenever you are changing let's say a value okay and it's present on uh let me just demonstrate in front of you why should I talk in words when I can demonstrate with visually okay so the I guess the command for running Mar notbook have talks and let's have a look at it uh so first of all you have to install marimo which is PIP install marimo it's",
  "install marimo which is PIP install marimo it's pretty basic just go ahead and run this command you will be able to install it and then I have to look in get started installation is done key Concepts let me just search it start let's run let's do this uh your notebook. P let's go ahead run this okay so the no the python F didn't existed before that's why uh it created it for me so I guess this command will work for every in any situation so marim edit and then your the name of your F okay so",
  "edit and then your the name of your F okay so here we have it so this is The marimo Notebook you can use and let me show you the power of the as well there it is I import import Mar and uh then we have to include few other things as okay okay okay okay so without doing this what we can do is let's say I'm going to run this uh which is X is equal to uh 5 + y f y is not defined let's do this Y is defined over here and now I will run it it's coming eight now what if I change this value of y is it",
  "eight now what if I change this value of y is it going to change the value of x as well absolutely it's going to change okay so it's like a reactive uh ju notebook okay so in juer Notebook let's say if I change a value of y to uh 90 let's say after this you have to in Notebook you have to run this upper cell over here to see the results right but in Maru it's just everything is reactive so I guess what they've done is that they have mapped each and every variable and where it has been used a",
  "and every variable and where it has been used a kind of uh they have created these du pairs that's a concept of software testing so they have created these du Pairs and then they are just whenever there is a change in the definition of a particular variable they update the use of that variable as Wells so D is a concept in software testing so I currently have software testing in my course so that's uh a concept over there which is where we have d d means definition d stands for definition let",
  "d d means definition d stands for definition let me use a okay in Du pairs d stands for definition and U stands for use okay yeah so it is Def and use so what I think is what they're using so this is just an assumption so what I think is that they have formed these du Pairs and these connections have been made so whenever the definition of a particular variable is changing whenever definition of a particular variable is changed the use of that variable wherever it has been used in the entire",
  "variable wherever it has been used in the entire notebook it will also change fine uh so let's let's convert it to a string instead this time okay and let's name it uh J okay and obviously now it's going to give you an error right but now if I just change this a string as well uh this like this okay now it won't give so you can see that the output is present over I just change it my name you can see these changes are this is one thing uh which marimo is really good at it is reactive the other",
  "marimo is really good at it is reactive the other thing is that you can create sliders for your variables as well so for that I have to check that documentation once uh I so it is m.i. slider no do UI do slider slider yeah it a slider and I guess it will be working like a for Loop fine so these values will be changed and uh okay let's storing the value over here let's store the value of the slider in a let's name it um let's say let's name it uh what should we name it C okay let's have it K",
  "uh what should we name it C okay let's have it K because one and now I'll be printing a statement which is uh F string fine so let's run this and let's run this as well let's run this cake is not it's a small C fine now let's run it and okay right now if I move this I should be able to see it I'm not able to see it uh okay so is no do MD we have to use MD okay empty it should work yeah so here it is uh be able to see it um okay it's cake. value yeah here it is so you can see that whenever if I",
  "yeah here it is so you can see that whenever if I just slide this uh slider you can see that this the value over there is Chang right and this is a pretty basic use of the slider application you can see a better application over here in this uh demonstration which they have given you can see that we are just changing the value of x and then they are calculate they Computing the value of e and they just so this e this this exponent value uh and they just should we say the giving the exponent",
  "they just should we say the giving the exponent value as the slider and you can see that it's changing so this can be used for graphs as well let's say I have created a graph and uh then I have a particular variable present over there uh then what it will do you just slide the slider and you'll be able to see that graph moving you to see that graph changing right this is a pretty powerful tool you can use and uh yeah uh here we have multiple other demonstrations as well as you can see okay so",
  "demonstrations as well as you can see okay so we have uh yeah so we have these functionalities in charts as well as you can see that they created the chart of the mnist data set so mnist is a data set with handwritten numerical values and you can see that you can basically select which portion of the graph you want to see and just hover over that and then you will you will be able to get this these image these images returned to so that's pretty powerful and pretty interesting as well to be",
  "powerful and pretty interesting as well to be honest so guys just go ahead and uh use marim Mo once and give it a try fine and before that I'll urge you all to just watch this video this is a really fantastic video to be honest just go ahead and watch this you'll be really amazed with this tool okay so anyone having any doubts or should we move ahead with the next interesting bit of this entire session fine okay so we have only two guys left okay yes so we can effectively decide for everyone",
  "yes so we can effectively decide for everyone maybe you can move yeah yeah you can decide for every okay so next comes native with Excel so this is pretty just creating dashboards with Excel not much interesting and it's pretty normal as well okay so let's create create something using comic gen and the thing is that I have never used comic gen before so I will be doing it with you guys yeah so I guess that this tool has been created using by gamina so gamer is the company owned by anander and",
  "so gamer is the company owned by anander and they have created this tool so it's it should be pretty interesting to look at Okay so mhm this is an uh no he's not that angry yeah so he's not that angry he is mostly have a smiley face in a really calm face to be honest okay so you can create so the thing is that using comic gen you can create your characters you can add a talking bubble with those characters and then you can kind of create panels for your comic fine so what I'm going to do is uh",
  "for your comic fine so what I'm going to do is uh okay so we have been given multiple names over here as well let's check for homes so this is for homes we have multiple characters we can use this is Genie and uh humans okay okay so we have multiple characters to use we have a panda as well it's so it's so good like you know the message they love Comics they want to generate and then they make a tool for themselves and everyone yeah absolutely so I guess that anansa used this comic gen uh tool",
  "I guess that anansa used this comic gen uh tool to create his own comic and uh if you just go to his blogs which is I guess the website is s an.net I'm not so this is his Blog Page and you can see that he posts a lot on this Blog Page and to be honest very interesting stuff uh so just my reads section yeah so you can see that he created uh glavin and hobis uh comic and I guess it was created using Lin uh he created that and uh it was pretty good I read the entire article was pretty good I read",
  "I read the entire article was pretty good I read this article as well books in 202 four and uh so he pretty much finished the entirety of Attack on Titan uh good as well yeah so just guys I will just urge you guys all to just go to his Blog Page and you will find really interesting stuff over there it is how to solve how to solve assignments as well absolutely you will you will find how to assignments as well so uh man I'm repeating I'm probably I'll probably try and repeat TDS if I can and I",
  "I'll probably try and repeat TDS if I can and I this time I'm using his [Music] blog so uh there was a blog post can you see this guys hacking and and I mean obnoxiously unhal this this work this worked this worked okay after after I did I was not able to solve the assment after that I found this blog post and I tried everything absolutely absolutely so this is uh so I guess this question was repeated in this term as well so it was first introduced in24 uh September 2024 term and you can see",
  "in24 uh September 2024 term and you can see that that question in ga3 last question 10th question where you had to uh where you you have to manage you have to get to that you have to make that llm say yes by any means so that you can so it had this entire block post has been on that on that particular portion how you can actually do it let's let's let's probably just cover the comic gen one first oh yeah sure I got distracted s okay so we have a slider over here as well uh what kind of smiley",
  "a slider over here as well uh what kind of smiley face you want okay so it's a smile to Oho face okay so it's uh here is the most smiliest person and then there is the Oho person okay we have a mirror as well so it will just mirror this image okay uh let's create a new character and okay we have Trump as well okay can create few stuff for this this is going to be interesting uh let's create uh he's angry uh what we can see rolling eyes guys can you see this that we have all these different",
  "can you see this that we have all these different filters not filters all these different settings you can apply and we have multiple characters on which you can apply these settings as this is pretty uh you know it's pretty good to see H okay face with mask what we do is bed perhaps and let's create a bubble uh how we can add a bubble can speech bubbles okay so it is like that so it is is Trump there it is there's Trump now uh we can move Trump as well good and how can I add another uh layer",
  "as well good and how can I add another uh layer to it okay we have different poses as well okay we have different poses as well guys maybe maybe maybe click on that TR okay I will open it ah okay so I guess that was just a trial no no no that was the older version ah okay okay okay okay so I guess we will have multiple other ofar oh sorry names as well we have a bottle we have Billy uh let's go back to Trump okay so the clothing of trump has changed and this absolutely doesn't look like Trump",
  "and this absolutely doesn't look like Trump uh so let's change the hair to his signature yellow uhhuh y it has to be like bright color and absolutely uh the shirts should be white suit blue is I guess it's good or it should be it can be gray as well uh this color is good WR right the tie can be red and then the Box color what is the Box color I'm not sure what's a box color let's leave it so we can select the background as well the background can be like this okay so this is the scenery the",
  "can be like this okay so this is the scenery the background is over here Trum Trumbo is over here and okay we can create a box as well okay so this is the Box this is a panel uh okay so this is a box let's trag this box can I track this box uh I can't trag this box okay we can change the pose of trump as well holding ice cream he's holding an ice cream while being in an angry pose let's make him happy yeah this is pretty good uh okay so he's happy after winning the election as you can see this",
  "after winning the election as you can see this uh let's make him cry okay so he's crying while doing a yooo uh we can do this is it is is there anything else to it h no no there is nothing else I just having fun with this comic yeah so guys uh this is all you can uh this is a lot you can do with this comic gen if you want to create your own comic just go to this particular link uh just search for Comic genin and you will get the first link uh from GR okay and just just just just one one touch",
  "GR okay and just just just just one one touch missing you have to write the word uh what yeah I should you should write the word tariff some tari uh over here uh you want me to write the word tariff on this particular page is it yes it's yeah I got it I got it yeah I I'm not sure how can I add uh another was yeah I know I know I know well ter is something which is which is defining Trump at the moment okay so uh guys this was it for today's lecture I hope you guys enjoyed by the way one last",
  "I hope you guys enjoyed by the way one last thing which I want to say is that when jash it's related to the droplet it's Rel to Azure so the thing is that when you are when you get those 100 credits for aure and when you're running a machine over there and when you're done with your machine just close your machine okay so make it a habit run it and then just close it because the thing is that if you keep it running for the entire time it will consume all your 100 credits for the year fine so",
  "consume all your 100 credits for the year fine so you have to open that machine only when also also we should be aware that those creds that we get we get it for a limited time period so they are going to expire after maybe a year or two anyway yeah yeah we do not want them to expire earlier and have to pay from our own pocket absolutely so it's exactly like uh APA tokens for uh TDS so people usually exhaust them and don't use them in an economical way that's discouraged always use them in an",
  "way that's discouraged always use them in an economical way and uh you know just make it and habit whenever you are running your machine on Azure always close it otherwise it will consume your $100 $100 is a pretty biger amount so if you consume that somehow if you forgot to close your server and then you for and then you consume all those $100 so that's up to you guys to be honest you get $100 for an entire year you have to use them economically fine so that was one thing and uh uh if you guys",
  "fine so that was one thing and uh uh if you guys have any questions please ask now or we can end the session right any questions sh shini roal anyone any questions you guys have have been pretty quiet for the entire session sh and Charlie have joined just yeah I just joined so I don't expect her to know much but Pro uh what do you think you have any questions any suggestions okay Shin what about you yeah I don't have any questions uh for now all right so how was today's session for you all of",
  "right so how was today's session for you all of you yeah I think uh I quite like today's session uh I mean like uh so you deployed it using digital ocean and doet and",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/l-F_A8P-XSs =====",
  "all right guys so welcome all to another live session and uh today uh so once again I'll be going through the agenda for today's uh for today's live session so first of all we will be looking at uh we'll be looking at the last topic remaining from week seven and uh then we'll be looking at gs7 as well few questions on gs7 also we'll be looking at few stuff from uh Al we'll be looking at from Project two and how you can actually map those uh you can actually map a question to a particular",
  "you can actually map a question to a particular function so that's what so these are some agendas for today's live session okay so we'll be starting in two minutes so give me e okay so I'll be sharing the screen and uh uh so just now saki asked us asked us that what should be the particular workflow of project 2 so I'll be demonstrating that so I'll be showing you guys is my screen visible by the way okay so let's get started so the thing is that uh by the way I'm using uh back on for the first",
  "uh by the way I'm using uh back on for the first time there might be few issues with that okay so let's get started all so talking about project two fine and so so we have to follow a certain pipeline it's going to be a particular pipeline when you are going to design this project first of all you have to uh just let's say if I want to if I was a student of TDS in this ter so so if I was a student of TS in this term so how would I approach this particular question so first of all what we will",
  "particular question so first of all what we will recommend you guys is that you should you should collaborate in order to complete this project the thing is that you have been given five GS right they've been given five GS and uh the number of questions in this five GS is more than 50 for sure and when it comes to uh so if a c if a single person just go goes ahead and you know creates 550 functions for each and every equation so that going that's going to be a task so what we're expecting you",
  "going to be a task so what we're expecting you guys to do is you should form certain groups you should collaborate on this project multiple people should you know let's say 50 people collaborate and all of them are all of them create a particular function for each question and uh one person you know just one person with really high technical skills they are able to just merge all those functions together so that's how uh we recommend you guys to go ahead with this project okay so uh this is",
  "to go ahead with this project okay so uh this is about collaboration now next comes that how would I approach this so let's say you have you have gotten you have gone into a particular you have gone into a group and now you now you guys are are deciding on how to approach this Pro so first of all so as compared to project one I would say that this is a fairly not fairly this is a bit simpler okay and why is that because it's pretty straightforward on what are you going to be evaluated on you",
  "on what are you going to be evaluated on you have solved those 5 GS and uh uh you know you know the answer of those 5gs as well so first of all you should start you should uh start creating those answers for all those G so uh that can be so this is one approach that you are creating answers for all those GS so that is so first one is first one is creating answers manually so obviously this is going to be a tedious task and it will require collab high level of collaboration fine and there are",
  "high level of collaboration fine and there are about 50 plus questions so definitely it's going to be a you know High collaborative next is that uh you use llms for solving these questions okay so next approach would be llms just like in Project one you devise an L you devise an llm which is able to solve these problems so first one can be using function calling okay let me use another color time let's use okay this one so first one should be first one would be function Callum next one would be",
  "one would be function Callum next one would be what it should be uh it could be a self correcting Loop self correcting Loop and last one could be a really sophisticated prompt which is I would say highly impossible to make given that uh students W weren't even able to create a prompt of particular one uh just a single prompt single turn prompt for those 10 questions in Project one so I would say that it's a pretty impossible task to create that for 50 questions this time fine so uh either you",
  "for 50 questions this time fine so uh either you can go with this function calling approach or you can go with this self correcting loop loop loop approach so that's up to you and uh okay so now let's come to the stages of this uh project so first of all you will be creating these you'll be using any one of these methods to solve your questions where is my mouse yeah there it is let's use another pretty color okay so after creating these questions uh let's say you have created these questions",
  "uh let's say you have created these questions your questions are already all done next you have to create you have to kind of uh create an application an API uh an API application where we are able to send an API request to a server and then it should return us with a certain value okay so it should return it should return us the answer for that particular question uh sir can you explain that uh last line that API thing just little bit uh just like you created an API for project one in the same",
  "you created an API for project one in the same way you are going to create one for project as well so in Project one you had 20 questions to work upon a 10 from phase one 10 from phase B sorry phase a and phase B so you have to create an API a fast API server for that and uh just like that you have to create an API endpoint for project to as well only that's the way we can access your work your code right if your API is LM agent is able to solve those problems that's the only so uh is that",
  "those problems that's the only so uh is that understood saki yes so sir uh for fast API we need to write another file and these these 50 functions can be written in the separate file or do we have to write yeah absolutely absolutely uh [Music] so okay so your function can be there on your functions can be there in another file while your first API server can import those modules from those different files and then we can use them yeah so that can be done okay sir so sir we have to uh submit the",
  "be done okay sir so sir we have to uh submit the files uh on the Azure uh then provide the link of azure to the uh form that we have yeah yeah so so the thing is that after creating these apis after creating all these different files and folders whatever you have so let's say you have created multiple files you have been using uh you have a different file for those functions you have a different file for those uh a for for that fast AP server you have a different file for identifying which",
  "you have a different file for identifying which question the API is asking you for so that's all files are already the next part is hosting this particular application okay and what is hosting so basically hosting means that you are going to put this entire code this entire code base well this is an application now this entire application would be published on the net and it's going to have a server it's going to have have a IP address or a domain using which you are going to access we are",
  "domain using which you are going to access we are going to access it fine so when it comes to hosting you have done hosting using versal right you done using versal but the thing is that verel is providing you free hosting which is not up to the mark of project two kind of okay so versal will be so when you hosting something on versal you are being allotted a certain number of uh you know RAM and disk space on their servers so nothing is for so it's not they're not just giving you something out",
  "not they're not just giving you something out of the air they have dedicated they have dedicated uh storage devices where your application is been stored they're providing you with some kind of ram a little bit of ram which is able to run your server which is able to run your application on the servers so that's how they are actually running your application but we doubt that the level of uh the level of questions we are going to ask you in Project two vers won't be enough for that ver was",
  "Project two vers won't be enough for that ver was enough for project one right it won't be enough for project two this time okay it's going to take a hell of a lot time to process what we are going to do what we are asking what we'll be asking them it for so veral is not recommended for that you can try using versal that's not a problem but it's we highly suspect it's not going to work the next bit is you can deploy it on so this is this hosting part can be referred to as deployment as well so",
  "part can be referred to as deployment as well so you can deploy it on uh Services which are free of cost have been given to you okay so one of them is azure and uh just like jaaj demonstrated in the last lecture that you can Avail a student uh a student package where Azure gives you all those different uh all those uh different services for free for one year I guess with $100 worth of uh credits and uh so that was for Azure I guess there is something for uh you can deploy it on digital oan as",
  "for uh you can deploy it on digital oan as well digital lotion is also present you can host it on hostinger as well but then again it's going to charge you moneyer is going to charge you money for that and if I'm not wrong that money is about uh 2,000 something uh for an entire year I guess yeah it is yeah it's about 2,000 for that entire year it's when we if you just calculate in dollar so it's $5 per month so calculat using that so it's $60 per year so just compute this $60 into just just",
  "per year so just compute this $60 into just just convert the $60 into Rupees you'll be able to uh get the exact number of money they're going to charge you for the services okay you can do that as well if you have the resources but uh we have given you these different uh have given you these hosting Services which are free to Avail using your student ID so using it madas ID you can Avail the for free and uh you can get started okay same with digal lotion uh but I I don't think so that hostinger",
  "lotion uh but I I don't think so that hostinger has that kind of uh kind of discount available for students at the moment and there are multiple other functionalities as well so one thing is that uh you can also deploy it on render as well so render is another platform where you can deploy your appc and I guess that they provide free deployment for one of your applications so only one of your application can be deployed on it and it would be given a certain number of uh resources more than",
  "given a certain number of uh resources more than which what they give uh for free on veral so you can go go check in that so I'm not sure about that you can just go and just verify this if it is true or not so render is one platform to host your applications fine so this is the entire workflow of project 2 we are expecting you guys to do okay build these questions build an API endpoint and then deploy it on a hosting platform fine and then obviously provide us provide us with the and I and the",
  "provide us provide us with the and I and the at the end we can host it on the Azure then we can uh so is it okay or we or sir is there any way to uh check that as your link is working as well uh means when we uh push the our code or files in the aure then uh is there any way that it will work for you when you check that well if you're able to access that end point from an incognit tab or from your mobile device then it's definitely going to work for us as well so let's say you have deployed",
  "for us as well so let's say you have deployed application on whichever service you want let's say you are going to use uh this was uh this Azure you deployed on Azure wait a second jump on another page yeah so you haveo it on verel sorry aure now the simply go ahead and uh so a will give you a custom domain so not not a custom domain so they will be giving you you some kind of domain I guess it's going to be an IP address and uh I'm not sure if they allow you to set a custom domain in that for",
  "they allow you to set a custom domain in that for free but after giving money you can definitely set a custom domain as well so you have been given a certain URL you on which your application has been deployed to now if this URL Works in an incognito tab or in a different device other than your laptop so it's definitely going to work for us as well fine just go ahead and send some requests some task requests using different device you will be able to look if it if it's working on other devices",
  "to look if it if it's working on other devices it's going to work on our device as Sir just one more thing when you uh send the query in the link then the response should be in Json form or the same format that uh we are going we are giving in the uh G portal or is it for in Json format so if you are going to uh so this is Project to page but if you just read over here so we are asking the responses in Json for right okay okay sir so if it's an image if it's an image then we okay so if if it's",
  "image if it's an image then we okay so if if it's an EMA then but we'll be requiring the uh answer as uh base 64 I guess that's the encoding base 64 encoding so it has to be a okay sir just one thing just one more thing uh sir is it possible that you can uh demonstrate the hosting in one of the session that how can we host on Azure because it was was uh free for with student email ID so yeah sure we can do that as well uh not in this session in another session we can do that yes sir sure sir",
  "another session we can do that yes sir sure sir okay so that concludes uh the workflow of project now we can look at the last remaining bit okay yeah yeah ask a question yeah so so can we develop our app for that it works like locally like normally we can use our o do like working directly and uping those functionality we can use directly uh are you saying that uh you will be running your server locally yeah locally when we test it we used to save that files in folder then process it like that",
  "that files in folder then process it like that we can develop or should we use like yesterday no no no so so so first of all you have to create your entire application on your device now you have to create that application on a device on a local machine using a local host you have to make all those tests using a local host and when you are finally sure that your application is ready just go ahead and deploy it on assure that's what I would say that uh you can get a pretty good tutorial on",
  "say that uh you can get a pretty good tutorial on YouTube as well on how to deploy a application on Azure okay so will work as such like a local machine itself right yeah definitely so just like verel versel was able to run your applications now it was when you deployed on versel it was able to run all your code without you being able to being uh bound to run your local server that's true now in the exact same way aure will be working yeah so it like we develop like for project when we develop",
  "like we develop like for project when we develop the doer F so like that Aur will be like serving us an environment which will download a file and serve the purpose yeah okay okay so uh make sure that uh when you have deployed your entire application and Azure has given you a custom a certain domain let's say if and using that domain if you are able to send a request and you are able to return you're able to receive a Json object then your project is completed okay so make sure that your url is",
  "is completed okay so make sure that your url is able to provide us just on objects just on responses okay and one doubt is there like in G one one question we had to move files and get the hash value M so I was getting like uh G one question number I think 14 I guess I don't AC this terminal it's 16 16 16 okay this one download exract use move all okay okay then okay okay okay so uh you asking that uh so what's your question no so this one I am getting different answer every time I because we",
  "getting different answer every time I because we need an absolute one folder we have to create and it should well you should not get a different value because the thing is that even if you have stored all these files in a different folder that doesn't matter it's running a GP command on these then it's using some uh sorting and then it's taking out the Shan of that so no matter in whatever folder you are storing it you shouldn't get a different value no it's like every time I'm running I'm",
  "value no it's like every time I'm running I'm getting that's the thing okay tellin yeah here is one question uh how are you unzipping the folder uh I am unzipping based on like unip module in Python itself we are using unip module you using yeah okay and you're still getting different here issue is that we have to create an empty folder each time right uh yes so uh like uh I am doing like I'm creating a folder with a name and then moving the files to it so every time I test it like mov the file",
  "to it so every time I test it like mov the file already exist right so how to like handle it should I delete the F like folder every time or like CU asual is not matching for me because that line is confusing just empty folder they have mentioned right okay uh I don't exactly remember the code for it but uh okay I will but it should not create any issue with the sum uh do you have the script at the moment because I don't have a script for this question number 16 let me check if I do have I use",
  "number 16 let me check if I do have I use Python to do but access script I have in bash only but it cannot be done right so I'm used python that script I have okay but then how did you solve it when you were doing ga1 because then it should have no that time I used bash bash it B it's working so that means it can be solved I mean it should not produce different answer each time right no second time I did not check right during GA I would have submit first right excuse me tellin yeah okay so the",
  "first right excuse me tellin yeah okay so the issue is you have a zip file right you're using a python module to unzip it right don't use a python module to unzip it use a bash command itself right you can run bash commands from your program on your your uh uh in your program itself you can run bash commands to extract files from python you don't have to use a python module because the underlying environment will still be a Linux environment right for your program when you put it into a",
  "right for your program when you put it into a whatever container you're putting it into so that will consistently give you the right answer so the answer to that particular question is you run a Linux command from your running application have it unzip it run the GP command and all those things and then computer has 256 100% of the time you'll get the same answer that's the solution so both I have to do using best that only will work yeah yeah that is the that is the correct solution that is",
  "that is the that is the correct solution that is the way to do it okay and all questions regarding to we have to use basment or like we can use you can use whatever works but for for computing that particular question your question was specifically with that right yeah yeah so to answer that question that is the correct way and probably there might be some other way but that is the way to get the 100% correct answer each and every time okay and it's not difficult to execute right you can",
  "and it's not difficult to execute right you can execute A bash command from your python without any libraries so it is very simple and straightforward why complicate it when you can do it the simple way okay and and it should be executed in that uh new folder right or there so when you look at the question right so ga1 question 16 I'm looking at it right now download a file extract it right yeah move all the files to an empty folder rename all the files so then uh when you're renaming all the",
  "the files so then uh when you're renaming all the files it tells you this what you got to do the um change the digits and the names or something the problem is not the folder itself right the problem is the when it when you sorry excuse me the the GP itself is run uh if you look at the grip command it is uh it is running on the files in the uh it's running on the files in that folder right okay so in the empty folder it's running thep I believe so that's uh what I think I think it is the grap",
  "so that's uh what I think I think it is the grap command is for the files in the folder if I remember correctly or not the extracted folder yeah it is for the files in the folder yeah that's because if you look at the look at the command itself right GP dot star what does that mean current folder all files in it so that is that command so that command means it is running on all the files inside the folder the name of the folder doesn't matter where you mov the folder doesn't matter uh those",
  "where you mov the folder doesn't matter uh those things don't matter the fact is it's in a folder and it has been uh moved and I think the reason they is it's been specifically asked to move it is probably some uh time modification occurs on the file when you move it I'm not sure but after extraction see you can try it right uh you try solving ga16 ga question 16 you can try it right now extract the file extract the zip run the grip command and see when you getting the right answer if you are",
  "see when you getting the right answer if you are getting the right answer when you uh do that uh operation you know that is precisely what you need to do in your actual function is that clear now yes got okay okay yeah carry on all right so uh now we have we are going to head towards the final topic of GA of sorry of week seven that we haven't discussed yesterday oh on Tuesday so that is Google charts and uh so let's head to the main homepage of Google charts and let's have a look at it so just",
  "Google charts and let's have a look at it so just like all the visualization tools I demonstrated ones fum uh rph so all these different types of uh lookas today as well so all these chart making uh all these visualization tools can be used to create these visualizations but the thing with Google charts is that you can embed it in your HTML code as well okay so uh let's go to guides and let's start a quick start okay so over here you can see that we have got a pie chart present over here right",
  "we have got a pie chart present over here right we have these six values and all these values are sorry five values and we have a pie chart related to them now can you see this that they have given us a HTML code where you can actually import the Geo the geostatic sorry the gstatic charts loaded yes so this is a Javascript file which is required when you are uh going to embed your uh Google charts in your code in your HTML code so it's like that when you are creating a website and let's say you",
  "when you are creating a website and let's say you want to visualize something uh let's say you are use you're creating a m 2 project so in Mt 2 project you have to present some visualizations uh along with your P along with your uh U right so in that case you can use Google charts to create these visualizations uh firstly you have to import the J the JavaScript file just like uh you do it with other uh with other visualization softwares with other visualization tools when concerned with the",
  "other visualization tools when concerned with the website development so you have to import that into script T then you can use the Google uh visualization API to create these new charts for okay you can see that we have so it's loading some packages which are for charts and uh then we are drawing something and then we are calling out a function of draw chart where we have all these values this can can you see this that we have this add we are adding these columns and then we adding these rows",
  "these columns and then we adding these rows and then it's going to create a beautiful py chart for us and uh yeah so all this code so when you are using Google charts you will be doing that in uh JavaScript okay you have to create a JavaScript instance in your you have to create a JavaScript tag in your code and then you can use it uh you can see that we are over here we creating this uh F chart and uh yeah so I guess they are we have a element present over there and then we are embedding that",
  "present over there and then we are embedding that this py chart in that element okay so uh this is how you can you use Google charts uh you can see that we have been given multiple charts you can use uh from this catalog you can see this calendar charts and you have a look at this okay so we have this calendar chart you can look at these examples right so it looks like a GitHub repository uh visualization and you can see and now next they have given you how you can create this reservation in",
  "given you how you can create this reservation in your in your website fine uh you just what you have to do is you simply have to copy this entire code from here right just copy this entire code uh I would say that copy from this copy this entire script tag all the script tags and then just make changes in your in the data set right so this is a CH this is the data it's a new row that they are adding just make some changes and you'll be able to see these beautiful visualizations in your website",
  "these beautiful visualizations in your website fine uh we have other charts as well you have a Gand chart we can create a Gand chart so uh yeah so this is a really beautiful Gant chart uh in BDM project we are required to create a Gand chart when submitting The Proposal right so you can use this Google charts for creating it as well uh we have Gio charts as well let's have a look at it uh okay yeah so these are Geo charts you can import the Geo charts package and then you can create this visual",
  "package and then you can create this visual so go ahead and give all these uh charts a try uh I would heavily I will really encourage you guys to just go ahead and create let's after the session just go ahead and create a basic HTML page and try to embed these charts over there okay so uh that was one part by the way guys any doubts uh regarding this Google charts any doubt guys or should we move ahead all right we can we can use it freely oh yeah we can use it freely so it's an API endpoint so",
  "we can use it freely so it's an API endpoint so it's uh Google charts API you can use it freely that's free to use okay so if we don't have any other questions ahead then uh we can start discussing G7 and for that uh gaj the stage is all yours e [Music] spe [Music] oh just give me one minute what is the still lot noise uh hello uh can someone just confirm if there is some background noise or something from my side uh this not so much no not much noise it's SC okay is there any little bit of",
  "noise it's SC okay is there any little bit of noise or something ah not really okay all right so in this question you have to create one uh Google sheet and then uh so these are the data any oh CP and then share it with these edit permissions and then sheet one should have these columns series id item ID and year and month so this table this sheet have cies ID year month can be uh captured from this stuff and then the other thing is value which is over here and then sheet two should uh have",
  "is over here and then sheet two should uh have create a pivot table that with the item as rows so it should also have one item so so if you look over here series id it's mapped to some item so that's what is there and then item should be uh coming as rows so in PIV table item should be rows and these should be the column so it should look like uh columns over here and then Zer and then value should be as values so if you don't know how to do this question then just go through this one this data",
  "question then just go through this one this data visualization and then Excel I think Excel might be there it is some easy thing that you can have a look over YouTube or else you can even use GPT to uh tell exact steps that you need to follow and then create columns these are the columns that you need to create and then over here just submit the Google sheet and then expl it so for this one it needs to be a PowerPoint so and then G sheet that is uh for creating this particular PowerPoint you",
  "is uh for creating this particular PowerPoint you would need some G sheet so that g sheet whatever you get after applying these formulas should be pasted over here and then this is again explaining thing what does it mean that the insights uh you will will be used by PR or agent you will here will be used by per or agent so yeah whatever inside like whatever you explain about the insides okay so those insides will be perer evaluated so that's good either peer or agent so agent means some LM so",
  "either peer or agent so agent means some LM so like this one there is no way to grade right so we cannot grade based on what is there in Google sheet what is there on PowerPoint there is no way to automate it so uh then we need to rely on PR grading or else llm grading so that's what it means the LM will be looking at your whatever text you write over here uh so just to clarify rwi one thing is uh your chart will provide some visual representation right a static visual representation so what",
  "right a static visual representation so what the Feer or the agent will do is it'll look at your chart it will look at your Insight and see if the Insight you have written matches what your chart is saying is is that clear as the agent will analyze chart and then it uh so chart it will analyze from uh uh like the Google sheet yeah it will analyze the static image static image where are we giving that H you don't have to give it right you just give the sheet okay yeah you give the sheet and the",
  "the sheet okay yeah you give the sheet and the sheet has the has C anything you provide whether it's the PowerPoint or whether it's the G sheet they will the whole point is visualization right there will be a visual in there correct okay and that visual will be taken uh F to from that sheet by the agent and evaluated yeah not necessarily just by an agent right it could also be a peer okay so if you write some rubbish in there and your chart says something different then you're not going to get",
  "something different then you're not going to get marks okay right so that's what okay so in this particular question we need a flourish chart and then again this is same question which needs explanation so here is one example regarding flourish thing uh so this is from uh this data set is picked from this particular kagle uh data set which have some Supermarket sealed kind of thing invoice number branch and then City these are different fields over there so these kind of charts can be created",
  "over there so these kind of charts can be created by flourish so it changes dates like it is for Chan to March 2029 2019 so it goes from 1 of Jan to 31st of 31st of March or something and over here it can be posed and then we can look for the values for that particular time period so it is uh getting the sale price for these three different I like cities okay so where is that and this is uh the link to flourish data Studio so in some of the session this should have been covered and then I think",
  "this should have been covered and then I think over here as well it should be somewhere in one of these videos yeah this is different so this is very inactive chart right and then this one yeah it requires you to create some scatter plot and on xaxis and y axis it should be uh coordinates and then color coding should be there for rental prices so this is the data set and it must have those four columns those three columns or four so what we need to use over here is fium so I have created uh one",
  "to use over here is fium so I have created uh one dummy example for this one so I can remove these comments for now rather what I will do is I'll create a new col notebook so I will first import from escal and data sets fet and we need it as an data frame so I will just pass the required parameter for loading it as a data frame and let me print the data and I think data do frame should get it as data frame so now we can have a look at what is there in data Stream So it have median income house",
  "in data Stream So it have median income house age and then average number of rooms average number of bedrooms and then a population and latitude and longitude and then medum house Valu so this data set was created in I think 1990 uh during some census in California and it was for predicting the house prices so what I will do is I will uh create a fium chart and uh map and then on that map we'll put these latitude and longitude and along with the median house value so first I need to import fium",
  "median house value so first I need to import fium and then [Music] fium dot map for generating the map it will just generate this empty map it doesn't have anything at the moment ah this is very painful so now I will just call it [Music] map and then we are going to give color scale for for this house um median house value so for that I will import some I will do some imports for that purpose so import do color map LM color map is equal to cm dot linear and then scale should be so we need scale",
  "linear and then scale should be so we need scale from the minimum of this particular column to the maximum of this particular column so let me just copy the name of the column okay what is problem in this one object has no attribute scale um okay let me just have a look at the documentation itself J you can also use cabor for doing the scatter plot and uh in the scatter plot itself you can use the color mapping uh directly in the scatter plot itself but I want to create this filium thing and uh",
  "but I want to create this filium thing and uh I mean yeah CBO I can use I was just checking out this documentation it's not too clean I already have solution for this in one of these script but I was just checking out the documentation so it should be this one should be the color map and then this maximum one Mr object has no attribute okay that is because we need to put this and then this one so now if you look over color map it will look on the scale of point 14992 5 point something right and",
  "scale of point 14992 5 point something right and now I will trate through all of those our rowes in this data frame and then will keep adding it to the California data set and the suggestion should be almost correct so we are creating circular markers for these locations and then radius is one and then this is for color mapping and let's just print this thing it should be map we haven't got anything on the map have we oh that is because I haven't assigned it to something so I need to add this",
  "assigned it to something so I need to add this to map this is scrw it uses that value and that heat map kind of thing uh yeah it's some of like this this color shows you uh the scale of it and this scale should be present in some corner or uh okay we don't have a scale on top of this so this is the scale so it is kind of heat map but on the actual map Zoom is very rep the code uh code okay this is the one does it have some triangular marker or something no rectangular uh we can look over the",
  "something no rectangular uh we can look over the okay this is about the filium stuff then this requires something to do with the lucer studio which was covered in the last session so you need to create a filter for so this data set it uh it's not so I will have to download it but uh it have these columns like number of bedrooms is in one of the colum and then house type is there and then house size is there so on data Studio you need to put a slider for this one Al actually this this this",
  "a slider for this one Al actually this this this example is very good on this one which is over here so he he have created this drop down for uh date and then for country and then for recruiter so whenever he puts some values if he haven't selected anything then it will be for all those countries and if he have selected something then this particular table or chart whatever it is it will be filtered on that particular uh stuff and then this particular um chart would also change so and then over",
  "um chart would also change so and then over here you would need to create some kumu Network and here is one of the example of kumu network can just close these open so it is created based on the connections of the actors like in how many movies they have acted together and this is this red color one is person who have acted more like this Ravi kishan he have acted in a lot of movies and then he have uh collaborated a lot with Kunal Singh because this is more uh redish kind of thing so I don't",
  "this is more uh redish kind of thing so I don't know the exact SC color scale but this Ravi kishan is the one who have collaborated a lot and then he have collaborated with someone this is uh there is this red thing is going over here and then it is going outside okay maybe I have pulled it out so uh these individual components we can even pull it out and then we can analyze it over here by zooming in so this guy have colaborated with uh these two three more people then we can pull out",
  "these two three more people then we can pull out something else out of it and then we can individually identify this chain this is very cool stuff looks like playing with of virus uh playing with the actual stands of virus stands of virus just zooming and seeing what is happening cular level yeah yeah I mean it's a it's a network diagram right so you can Network map many things in it so you're right you can use it for many kinds of network type analysis anything that connects nodes to uh with",
  "analysis anything that connects nodes to uh with edges and things of that sort you can do so like for example if you just instead of pulling it out if you just move your cursor over one node and keep it static for a little while then you will suddenly see it will show you uh What uh you know what it's connected to and dim out everything so that's what kumu network is very good for this visualization it is usually difficult to analyze how did we create this or do we learn this in I thought San",
  "create this or do we learn this in I thought San had covered in one of the session I think yesterday session I mean Tuesday session Tuesday session yeah I can use it for analyzing logistic data uh logistic data yeah if it have some node and then edes kind of connections then definitely you can use it so I think this is the one which uses kumu network if I'm not wrong I think this is the one no no no no this is not the one which uses Kum this is just a kind of rant On's claim that he was first",
  "just a kind of rant On's claim that he was first you know he was first offered the role of ofar Ro so it's a kind of a fun and R video okay so do we have K network over here H yeah this is the one visualizing Network data yeah vising data all right so and okay now this is just submit button so I can click on this button this is very good tool like uh Google data Studio on these uh drop downs and then the filtering part so it looks good okay sh uh you can take over all right for uh the thing is",
  "you can take over all right for uh the thing is that uh I'm not able to share my screen somehow so let me rej the meeting once then I'll try one again e e e okay left okay all right guys so is my screen visible someone just give me some thumbs UPS your screen is visible all right so now what we're going to discuss over here is that how you can actually map a particular uh let's say uh a particular task with a function so let's say you received a task uh okay so this is a task which was given to",
  "task uh okay so this is a task which was given to you using the API Ed call and then how will you map this particular task with a function which is present in your code right so uh out of those one out of those 50 questions more than 50 questions in fact we can give you any of the any any of the any number of these questions right so how you can actually map these functions how you can actually map that particular question to a function so for that there are multiple approaches so one of them",
  "that there are multiple approaches so one of them is simply uh you know copy pasting the exact question over there and then expecting and then just filling it with if else uh if else condition so that's one approach but uh that's a pretty tedious and uh I would say a pretty bful approach to your so what you can do is instead you can have so this was one approach you can the another approach is that you can use sentence Transformers or you can use embedding in general when we're talking in",
  "use embedding in general when we're talking in general so you can use uh embeddings which can either be created using sentence Transformers or it can be created using open API sorry open a uh API and that we have provided right so that can be created as well and uh uh so these are was one thing about embeddings this is another way the Third Way is to use keywords way is use keywords to kind of understand which kind of which question we talking so let's say uh let me head back to the TDS portal",
  "let's say uh let me head back to the TDS portal once and then I will try to explain you guys what I mean f is function col h f is what f is the function which is present in your code okay okay okay yeah yeah so uh it's pretty hard to draw with the mouse so okay I just wrote an F this it's over here so the key approach what you have to do is you have to add identify a certain keyword which is specific to that question and uh let's say this is the let's take an interesting question okay so this",
  "let's take an interesting question okay so this is uh this is the question this is the fth question of G1 where we are where you're required to use Excel to run this particular uh code particular function one of the keywords can anyone identify any keyword from this particular question which has not been repeated in any other G in any other G question here can even identify some any keyword by the way let me just erase all these cors okay so anyone can you guys uh guess which kind of keywords",
  "can you guys uh guess which kind of keywords should we use in order to you know kind of identify which question we are talking about anyway uh you can use some take s by those can be the keywords absolutely so that can be one thing we can use Su take and sort by so this can be the exact keyword with sum and then this opening brackets then take then this Open brackets and sort by this can be one thing uh but there can be a possibility that this will change perhaps there is a possibility okay so",
  "change perhaps there is a possibility okay so that so that you know that approach is usess in this case I would say so you have to be prepared for any sort of uh situation that is that would be presented to you right so over here what I would suggest you to do is you can use Office 365 as your keyword right because Office 365 hasn't been repeated in any other uh GA yet if I'm not wrong so this can be one keyword for this specific question and what you can do is that you can map so you can",
  "what you can do is that you can map so you can search for the specific keyword in the uh question in the in the in the task we have specified in the API endpoint and then if your API endpoint if so let's say you received a task right from the API endpoint and then you can search for this keyword search for this keyword in this so if you're able to find it that's pretty good if you're able to find this particular keyword then voila you have found you have identified that this is the fifth",
  "found you have identified that this is the fifth portion of gs1 and you will have some particular function ready for that yes okay uh if you didn't find it then uh you'll be looking for other key right so this is how you can you will be approaching the you're going to keyword approach okay so the keyword approach is I would say again it's a lot of work you have to identify keywords from each and every question and uh even after you have identify a keyword from a question there can be a",
  "identify a keyword from a question there can be a possibility of ambiguity so why to take a risk in that right so Eva task is more like you are putting a lot of efforts for very little gain right so instead you are students of TDS and uh you have been taught how to create embeddings and what are the uses of embeddings so instead of that instead of creating you know lazy keywords which can be interpreted in different ways which can be ambiguous as well you can use embeddings instead right so",
  "as well you can use embeddings instead right so let's say so I created a basic uh application for this this is a basic fastp application and you can see that uh I have different files over here as so what I'm doing is that I have a different file which is going to get the embeddings and then it will identify which question they're talking about okay so in this Center trans uh pile you can see that I have a question bank so over here I've taken three questions there we have three questions over",
  "questions there we have three questions over here uh and among these so I have taken only three questions for the sake of explanation so we have three questions and now we are going to identify which question we are talking about okay uh so uh I just created a class for that as well because the thing is that uh I wanted to store this somehow I wanted to create an instant of it so that's just the logic building part which I did so I have created a class this match question class and what I'm",
  "a class this match question class and what I'm going to do is I am going to import it in my index. Pi file which where I have my pasts by the way let me magnify this as well it be much more visible to you guys great so uh again I will be explaining what I just said so I have this specific file which is sent trans. and what it does is it applies sentance Transformers embeddings it uh finds these it encodes these three questions the are three questions which I'm talking about so it encodes these",
  "which I'm talking about so it encodes these three questions uh in embeddings it also encodes the question that has been given to us and then it finds the similarities and then it gives back the uh question which has the most probability of being uh related to that particular task okay so if I head back to index. F over here I'm import so as you can see that I've created a different class match portion class and over here I'm importing this class from this specific file so this is how you can",
  "from this specific file so this is how you can use multiple files in Python and you can import modules and classes from those files okay so it's nothing it's nothing that difficult it's you just have to write from trans input this particular either it can be a method or it can be a class fine so what I did was I just created a instance and now let me run a few tests okay uh there it is yeah there it is so I will be running so first of first and foremost I have to um okay I guess my servers is",
  "foremost I have to um okay I guess my servers is already on all right I it on once yeah fine so this is my my service is running now and what I will do is I will send a question okay I will send on this as well there it is copy it over here and it's going to be like this okay and it's a post request which which requires a body and the body is going to have by the way guys you don't have to be intimidated with whatever I'm doing so I'm just sending a post request with a body and uh the way you",
  "a post request with a body and uh the way you can receive a body in fast API is that you have to create a a Bas model kind of thing so it's like creating a new data type typ and you have to create this class and then you can use uh you can actually patch body out of the post request and fasty okay so how did I how was I able to uh get to this simple just use CHT okay ah okay so this was uh okay I have to enter the text so this is going to be so this text part is going to be the uh question that",
  "text part is going to be the uh question that has been given to us okay uh so let's say question get back yeah so let's say the question is the question was something like this what is the sum of all values associated with these symbols fine so this is the part which has been given to us and let's modify it a bit what is the sum of all values uh related with these symbols okay this is good with these symbols and what are the values okay so I just modified the question of it and let's see this",
  "modified the question of it and let's see this is this has been given to us I like this okay uh bad [Music] string issue okay let me just send this request and let's hope everything yeah like the space won't be causing any issue right and also Jason Jason shouldn't that text be under text have that colum thing Jason No it should be yeah now it should be uh yeah this should work I think uh let's send it and let's hope I we get the correct yeah here it is so this is the response which we have got",
  "it is so this is the response which we have got download and process the files blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and at last we can see that what is the sum of all these values symol so uh sentence Transformers is able to do all that it's able to create these embeddings and then we are able to identify which kind of portion we are talking about so you guys can use sentence Transformers that's a really good tool you can use okay uh by the way any questions in sentence Transformers and how",
  "any questions in sentence Transformers and how I'm approaching this any how are you like did you like uh have some file in which you mention all the questions and then you used it to create Ed uh you can do that as well soing yeah so this is the file where I'm actually creating these edings okay this set sent trans. P file where I have this model and what I did was because I just had to I just have so uh I just had to demonstrate this in this particular session so I didn't want it to go through",
  "session so I didn't want it to go through the pain of going through all those 50 questions so I just selected any three questions out of the first uh first five GS so so when you're giving these three questions are you like uh having separate strings or in one string you are mentioning no no we have separate string so as you can see that this is a separate string so actually this is an entire list of questions okay and these questions are stored in uh multi-line Comm multi-line strings as you",
  "in uh multi-line Comm multi-line strings as you can see so this is one question uh this is another question and this one is another question so in total there are three questions over here and what I'm doing doing is so let me just go through this particular function uh though you can create it yourself as well with the help of either copilot codm or CH gbd but let's go through it so simply I'm uh importing sentence Transformers I'm assigning it a model so the model is all mini LM uh blah blah",
  "a model so the model is all mini LM uh blah blah blah blah I'm not going that and next is I have created a class so this is a concept uh which I guess you might have learned in your python course so I just created a class match question and this is the initialization of that function I have a question Bank okay I have a question Bank where I have stored these three questions it's nothing but a list of strings fine and the next part is that I'm creating these embeddings okay that's the easy part",
  "these embeddings okay that's the easy part I'm just creating these embeddings model. end code this this is this convert to tensors is equal to true so we are creating these embeddings over here and then I have a different function so the thing is that when in index. let me just close these files okay so when I'm creating uh this instance in index. pi over here this sent instance of match question so this was the match question right so when I'm creating this instance of this match question over",
  "this instance of this match question over here it's going to to create these embeddings for me after that when I have to actually match the match the question match the should I say the task which has been given to me I have a different function for that which is this match question function okay and I am just simply using it match question function and this is the item do so what is this item. text it is nothing but a kind of custom data type that we created fine so using this space model",
  "that we created fine so using this space model class so I don't even uh I don't know how this item class works I have just from Char okay what what item class you talking about the thing is that uh python allows you to create data types of your own okay so just like in uh C in C language we can create our own structures we can create our own data types kind of things and even in Java if I'm not wrong it's possible we can create different data types of ourselves uh in python as well it's uh",
  "types of ourselves uh in python as well it's uh allowed you can create a different data type uh so over here we have I have text I can have number as well okay so this was text I can let's say I want to create data type where I'm storing the I'm going to store the name and the role number of students present in this meeting oh fine so this is this has created this class now let's say uh okay this has I have done this fine now what I'm going to do is instead of running this particular function",
  "do is instead of running this particular function just for the sake of explain explaining you guys what this base model item is doing I am going to uh let's uh what should let's print it out okay not print it out let's return the value okay and it would be uh string yeah send ah no it's item. name we will be sending and uh with roll okay so let's do one thing let's add a bit of flavor into it as well so Ro marks are also here okay in this inter now so this particular name with the role number",
  "now so this particular name with the role number it should be item dot roll number score this much marks in Roe fine so this is uh dat type and this is what we are going to return okay so we have created this particular data type and uh we have sent uh requirement that this is this particular end point this SL sent trans end point should receive it fine and then it should return this particular value okay so this is done let's head back to okay not head back to we have to create a thund client",
  "not head back to we have to create a thund client instance there it is where is okay here it is under client let's head back to it for some reason my Postman is not working so I love Postman anyway but uh today I'm using because it's not working du to some reasons I'm using C CL okay so uh here is a new request and now I'm going to send a request to this sent trans uh sent trans end point with a body where the body is a Json object okay and over here I will specify the name to be let's take GIC",
  "here I will specify the name to be let's take GIC okay three right and uh let's take another thing uh what it is uh role number RO number uh is uh let's take anything 1 2 3 4 5 6 and and his Ro marks are let's take uh because it was out of 10 I guess yeah it was Let's Take N fine uh is it right uh okay okay this should be an integer okay so this is what we have done uh is everything in place AR marks R number fine so let's send this request and let's check what happens it should be a post",
  "and let's check what happens it should be a post request so in only in post request you can actually send a body not in get request not in a get request okay so I'm sending a post request with this body send it let's check what I have received so it is RI with rule number 1 2 3 56 scored nine marks in Roe okay so this is how uh you can actually receive data from uh post request in fast J it's pretty I want to say straightforward yeah it's pretty straightforward in flask so if you guys have any",
  "straightforward in flask so if you guys have any experience with flask you might be able to relate what I'm saying that it's pretty simple to do these things to receive the body of post request in fast in flask but because I'm using fast AP that's why we have to reild that okay any questions regarding this no I I just want to see your sent uh transfer file once okay the sentence this is nothing this is no no rocket S I would say I just have this question Bank creating these embeddings and again",
  "question Bank creating these embeddings and again okay and uh in this function we have nothing but uh I'm sending I'm specifying this self this is necessary when you are creating a class class this question and then I'm just creating the encodings for this question converting it to a tensor as well and then I'm just taking out the cosine similarity so this is taking out the cosine similarity using py torch I don't know about this I just copied it from chg okay okay and what are you doing in",
  "it from chg okay okay and what are you doing in open a AI embed like do not share obviously if you have your API and point there otherwise no no no no I'm going to share it so uh this was one method of creating uh of actually getting to mapping your questions fine this was one method the another method is that using open AP open AI embeddings which we have taught to we already taught you this these embeddings of uh on this portal fine so you can use this as well simply pass all the questions",
  "use this as well simply pass all the questions and get the embeddings and then pass the question which has been uh given to you in the task as well and then find the coine similarity so that's one another way the only drawback of this the only drawback of this uh is that you will be consuming your API tokens API tokens are fine but the the the problem is also like it won't consume a lot of AP to because the consume a lot of API tokens that's true but like the latency issue latency may be an",
  "true but like the latency issue latency may be an issue latency no yeah latency can be an issue for sure latency can be an issue I tried running this particular uh API end point let we just I haven't uhuh what is the limit 20 milliseconds let me just check it let's uh run this on this particular uh end point though I'm not sure if my veral environment is going to allow like the thing on on our Ser that is going to be faster than open doing it now so yeah yeah for sure so sentence Transformer is",
  "so yeah yeah for sure so sentence Transformer is way faster than open a open AI because the thing is that it's sending an API request and then it's fetching out those embeddings but in sentence Transformers the entire module is present in your system fine so that's going to be definitely faster this is open a Bings let's let's try sending it right I'm going to send this uh okay it's also post request uh so let's see guys I have three questions and let's check if it's able to provide me those",
  "and let's check if it's able to provide me those embeddings or okay I'm going to send this it's sending inter server error where is it uh okay okay this is match data uh let's Sprint the match instead that's much better okay let's send it this one okay so I'll send it once again let's check so can you guys see this it's running and running and running and running just for three questions ah okay so my a my AI proxy token it's not able to fetch it from the local environment somehow and uh I",
  "it from the local environment somehow and uh I won't be presenting it over here so the thing is that you can use this approach as well but uh you have to uh so daty is going to be an issue just like pointed out so it's going to be latency and your API tokens are also at stake let's say if you got so API tokens it won't consume much API tokens to be honest we just have 50 questions present over here there and you once you get the embeddings of those 50 questions you store it in a file there is",
  "50 questions you store it in a file there is no point in running uh that uh particular embeddings one again and again right so there is no point in that you just have to store those embeddings for once and then you can use it for uh getting those back same goes with the sentence Transformers just store the embeddings somewhere in a file and use it again and again fine uh okay how do one one time weate the betting St mhm and then then then we we store it on the server so every time the request",
  "store it on the server so every time the request is going to be made it is not going to regenerate those endings now no uh uh yeah so in my case it's going to regenerate those embeddings uh because uh I just created this uh server in a haste so I didn't bother with uh taking into that cons taking that into consideration so what you can do is uh instead of placing this embeddings this entire this particular chunk of code not this this particular chunk of code in the function you can instead just",
  "of code in the function you can instead just run it once store them embedding somewhere in a Json object or whatever you want and then use again and again right that done as our server will be continuously running if we run it on like Azure or E2 instance or dig version so then because of because of that uh if it it has generated once it won't generate again and again unless obviously we are doing this thing for yeah yeah so uh this uh so this was the another method of creating embeddings and",
  "was the another method of creating embeddings and uh so I have demonstrated about three methods I guess so first one was uh using uh keywords right first one was using keywords you can identify next was using embeddings and in embeddings I have shown you guys two methods which are cence Transformers or this one and uh yeah so these are the two methods fine so uh that was it so anyone anyone having any questions uh regarding this guys anyone having any questions or should we move ahead by the",
  "any questions or should we move ahead by the way uh we don't have anything else to discuss at the moment so if you guys have something to discuss you Canad lot of things to ponder on like first honestly I was not uh uh for I don't know why because I was not able to figure out how should I start now at least this is because see ultimately we have to just expose an API end point which the valuation script is going to test on so this at least gives us a skeleton on how to begin and then yeah",
  "gives us a skeleton on how to begin and then yeah absolutely absolutely so uh guys uh I would recommend you all to so I guess only few days are remaining 31st is the deadline to submit the project so I will urge you guys to go ahead and start making this project pretty fast it's a large project so it's not in the quantity so sorry it's not in the quality it's in the quantity this time fine so project one was more about quality this time it's more about quantity so you have a lot of functions",
  "about quantity so you have a lot of functions you have a lot of things to do and uh uh I would seriously recommend you guys to collaborate with other people other students make groups right make groups and uh one thing one approach can be a particular group of let's say 15 to 20 people or any number they want to collaborate with creates this entire project and if they are so openhearted they can you know just release it just release the entire code to everyone El so that can be that's also",
  "code to everyone El so that can be that's also allowed that's also possible but uh that depends right uh so yeah start creating this project uh go ahead and make collaborations that's much appreciated just get along with other people start making projects with them right so uh this is one thing uh by the way any guys anybody anybody having any questions uh because we are at the end of this live session you guys can just open your heart heart and ask any questions without any hesitations anyone",
  "ask any questions without any hesitations anyone like what it be recommended to use like people are sharing collab notebooks of potential solutions they do not all seem right but should we like reattempt the GS or at least use whatever Solutions we were wise enough to save ourselves uh yeah or or kind of mix and match between all those things yeah yeah yeah so if you have uh codes for those different questions even if you get that from someone someone else so that's that's that doesn't make any",
  "else so that's that's that doesn't make any difference in that now you can use any code the questions the language is going to be the same the methodology is going to be the same it's just that your parameters will change now you just have to take care of that because code won't be changing for some GS I saved for some other GS what I did iums and then then it got reset yeah so uh that's the thing and uh so yeah uh any any any questions I guess not so that was uhse that was uh it for this live",
  "not so that was uhse that was uh it for this live session what we are planning that uh there is one tool called selenium and uh it's not present in your course at the moment but it was present in my course my and jaaj course uh in may4 term and I would say it's a pretty powerful tool and uh it can sometimes save you from a ditch right it can save you from multiple hard hard situations where you're not able to understand what you what you are going to problem so that selum can save you from",
  "going to problem so that selum can save you from those situations and we are planning that uh towards possibly the towards maybe in the next week or after uh the deadline for project two we are going to show you guys how you can test a demonstration video of how you can use selenium to do a lot of things right it would be an introduction to selenium because I believe that it's a really important tool and that should be Ted to you guys F uh so that was it for this live it is also for selenium",
  "that was it for this live it is also for selenium sell name is for multiple things okay so you can automate stuff with that you can uh so one use case can be that uh let's say uh so there is something that Google uh allows you to make some searches okay so Google has a kind of program where you you have to make some manual searches on Google and then you pay then you then they pay you in some kind of currency I don't know uh and then you can redeem it into roblo Robo Robux roblo currency which",
  "it into roblo Robo Robux roblo currency which is Robux or any other kind of currency you can redeem that so uh that was one thing uh that uh that's where you can actually automate that entire stuff of manually searching through each and everything by using selenium right so that can be done H that was one thing uh another thing as you mentioned it's used for web saving for sure so web scripting can also be done with that and uh yeah so there are multiple use cases it's so I will just tell you",
  "multiple use cases it's so I will just tell you what selum is so it's like the code is controlling the uh the code is able to uh you know run Chrome in your browser so let's say uh this is my Chrome right this is my Chrome so this entire window will be controlled by the code maybe maybe I deviated so we'll discuss it in the next session yeah next next session I don't know perhaps after to as well okay right so that was just a brief introduction about that by the way guys so uh this uh this over",
  "that by the way guys so uh this uh this over and uh yeah have a nice uh good night guys bye okay thank you for the nice session yeah thank you R for interacting with all of us thank you everyone for joining the session and thank you for interacting",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/WyO9CYWiP20 =====",
  "Hello. Audible. Yes sir. Yes sir. All right. So uh so I have prepared a small uh kind of demonstration for the project too though it's not complete uh but I'll be showing you how the dynamics of this entire uh project are working. Okay. So uh all right so basically this is the first uh this is the uh last uh just multiply this ones. This is the fast API file. Uh over here we are initiating a fast API instance and then we are creating these routes and uh uh yeah so these routes have been",
  "routes and uh uh yeah so these routes have been created. So what am I doing over here is that I can just comment this now. Okay. So in this fast API uh environment in this fast API uh file I just have one uh I just have one uh endpoint over here which is for uh uh okay so this is for okay this is one uh endpoint to get the trans get the uh encodings get the embeddings to get the embeddings from the sentence transformers library and uh over here you can that uh whenever a particular question has",
  "can that uh whenever a particular question has been passed to this particular endpoint with uh whatever parameters we have let's say if I am over here and uh I'm going to pass this particular question okay let's pass to this endpoint and uh my question is this and let's put the file name as anything abd let's And uh okay can do is let's convert it to this object at that moment. Uh so let's send it. Let's wait for the response. is not going to work. So the thing is that this particular endpoint",
  "So the thing is that this particular endpoint will so what this endpoint is doing is that it's taking the question which is present over it's uh taking this question uh key from the body and this we have a file uh as well file key as well and uh what we're going to do is that uh this function this particular function it will pass this question from the body to a to this particular function from the sentence or commas uh uh file which I so I have one other file which is over here so this",
  "I have one other file which is over here so this particular file is basically used to identify which question are we talking about okay so uh you can see that I have taken about three questions over here and uh what we're doing is we're using sentence transformers to create embeddings and these embeddings are being applied over this question back over these three questions, right? And these three questions are being encoded. Uh we can we are able to get these embeddings and after getting these",
  "to get these embeddings and after getting these embeddings, we are also we are also encoding the question that we have got and then that's and then we are actually uh using uh uh cosine similarities to identify which question are we talking about. Okay. So I demonstrated this in the last session but let me do it once again. Uh let's close it. Uh here we have it and the match. So keep them side by side. Fine. So uh let me demonstrate it by setting uh this is good and uh fine. Okay. So it's",
  "uh this is good and uh fine. Okay. So it's creating those embeddings. Okay. Uh [Music] Let's let's just change it to ah okay the thing is that we are not sending it over here. We have to fetch this from the response right uh from the body and to get it from the body we have to use this uh okay we are getting these response And let's move this file one for the moment and it's an STR. Okay. Let me ask uh GPD for that. I think should be asking for data not JS. Mhm. In the body can be uh question",
  "data not JS. Mhm. In the body can be uh question should be asked in the form data in the request. Uh yeah in the form data. Yeah. At the request form. Ah okay okay. Thank you. That's a valid point. Ah yeah yeah yeah. This should be overhead. Maybe a stupid question, but how do you do this programmatically without uh using thunder client? Without using thunder client. Uh uh what do you do without having right which is like a post? Yeah. Yeah. So how does this uh handle uh in the can be done",
  "So how does this uh handle uh in the can be done using request library we are sending as so how how we catch this data on our back end? Yeah, how we c that data and uh that's what I'm trying to do actually and uh I had this let me keep it open. So this is a form as well. Uh let's see if I'm to fetch it or not. So actually uh I made some changes in my data that's why it's not working as intended. But let's try to debug it. Right. Uh uh let's try now probably doing something. Let's check over",
  "now probably doing something. Let's check over here. Um all right. So it's able to print the question. It's getting the question and I believe it must have created the uh yeah okay okay okay so it has returned uh the question that was uh after creating these embeddings it has returned these questions the question which is the most similar to the one we have asked right so whoever suggested using this form uh tab instead of JSON so thanks a lot uh so over here what I did was it was it's pretty",
  "uh so over here what I did was it was it's pretty simple so I had this question bank of three questions we created the embeddings for this right then we created the embeddings for the question so this particular question that we have asked this one this particular question so I've created the embeddings for this question we used coign similarities to identify which question is the most similar to the as question and then we have returned this particular question fine So this is how we are",
  "particular question fine So this is how we are actually uh getting the intended question which and now so the thing is that why am I using encodings to actually identify which question am I talking about? The thing is that in my code I basically know that uh which questions are we talking about. So over here as you can see that this is a JSON file and over here I have mapped these questions these specific questions to a particular function. Right. So this is a function name actually which is",
  "So this is a function name actually which is present over here. So this is uh uh this is my functions.py file where these functions are present. And uh what I'm doing is that in this JSON file I am mapping these questions this entire string for this question with this one with this particular string name the name of the function. I have these functions over here and then in the index file index.pfire file I am calling these functions. So I also get the uh so as you can see that after getting",
  "get the uh so as you can see that after getting the match. So the match over here is so as we see that this is what we are returning. So this is the match. So what is the match? The match is this particular response that we have got. Yeah. So the match is this particular response that we have got right. And what I am doing at the moment I'm using this particular string to get the name of the function that we want to use. Right? So I let me try it. By the way, I guess this would fail because uh",
  "By the way, I guess this would fail because uh what I have to do is I have to get this question back. Uh okay, I have to get this question back from the file itself. See, so this is the question bank. Uh let me keep a backup for this and set question bank is equal to I will then uh map question bank JSON loads and what we have to do is this is okay I have to import JSON as well import JSON Right. So here we have it and I want the keys and from those keys I want to convert it to a list and I",
  "those keys I want to convert it to a list and I believe this should work. Let's check it. Let's try running it once again. Commenting this out. Hopefully this should work. So it's taking uh what I suspect is it's taking this amount of time because it's creating those embeddings using transformers. Hey, maybe I missed something here. But shouldn't the because the server is running, shouldn't the embeddings already be there? Uh, this bit since our server is running. Yeah. Yeah. Making changes.",
  "server is running. Yeah. Yeah. Making changes. Yeah. the server is running but these embeddings I'm actually so this is my pad on the so this is my bad that I'm not storing these embeddings somewhere okay that's why these embeddings are being created once again so uh when you are creating these embeddings you should be absolutely sure that you have to store these embeddings in a particular file and then import them and use them as fine Okay, it's taking a lot of time. Let's check what's usually",
  "taking a lot of time. Let's check what's usually match. We have this match question and uh okay some value of these symbols uh okay this has printed or not. Okay. So okay okay okay it doesn't have any attribute question bank uh fine. Let's check what's the issue. Okay, it's question mapper should be question bank right now. Let's cancel this request cancel. Let's close it. Open one more instance client request and our API endpoint is this and set trans the okay so the form would be question and",
  "trans the okay so the form would be question and let's paste that particular question where is that uh let's copy it from here. Okay, I copied it and [Music] it so here it is and the file would be a b c d uh zip. Okay, let's hope it works. connection was forcibly closed. Okay. Okay. It's starting to reload stuff and Okay. in class and creating the instance and let's [Music] print. There it is. Okay. All right. Okay, let's try running it once again. Hopefully, it should work. Is it working?",
  "again. Hopefully, it should work. Is it working? Clear. Okay, it's printing the question bank. That's good. And I suppose it's creating the embeddings at the moment. Let's wait for it. These embeddings will be created. And uh in the meanwhile, let me show you what I am actually doing. Okay. What's my thought process at solving this question? Okay, I'll draw Okay. Are you guys able to see the screen? Yes. Yes. All right. So what I am doing at the moment is that I am uh so I have uh fast API",
  "the moment is that I am uh so I have uh fast API server. Let me I have a fast API server running fine. And uh over here what I'm doing is that whatever uh whatever uh uh requests come to this particular server. So this is a request coming. What I'm doing is that I will so uh this particular request will contain let me use another color. This particular request will be containing the firstly the question the question and the file right so these two things this particular request will be",
  "these two things this particular request will be containing and what I am going to do is that first of all I will pass this particular question so my first priority over here is that I want to identify which question I'm talking about right so we already know that what all questions will be asked. So the questions are basically uh the questions from G1 to G5 right. So we know that we have about 50 more than 50 actually about 50 questions and uh so we know that we have these particular so I have",
  "we know that we have these particular so I have a question bank present over here and this question bank has about 50 plus questions right so I want to identify which question in this question bank does this question relate to okay so uh okay so what I want to do I want to identify that which question which particular question in this question bank does this question which has been asked to us is relating to okay and for that I'm using the embeddings okay fine so embeddings can be created using",
  "okay fine so embeddings can be created using sentence transformers that's one way sentence transformers or the other way is using lms right And uh when you're using LMS uh what so if you're using LMS or if you're using sentence transformers it's a good practice that you store these embeddings uh uh when you get them right. So storing them is the okay so you have to store these embeddings somewhere. So that's that's what I'm doing wrongly wrongfully at the moment that I'm not storing these",
  "at the moment that I'm not storing these embeddings but it's really important that you store them. So in sentence transformers you can create these embeddings any number of time but the thing is that it will take a lot of time right so create and with lms u so it it consumes your tokens to create these embeddings so it's always wise to store right so store your embedding somewhere and then use that uh whenever you get this question right so what I am doing right now so let's say I have",
  "so what I am doing right now so let's say I have identified that uh this particular question which is present in the question bank has been asked with you question right now what I will do is now I also have a file a particular file where I have mapped so I also have a file where I have mapped that with which particular question so I have 50 question let's say I 50 questions. So for 50 questions I have 50 functions as well. Right? So for these 50 questions I have 50 functions. Right? These 50",
  "50 questions I have 50 functions. Right? These 50 functions are going to perform whatever these particular question was asked. Okay. So these are custom made functions. Now these are custom made functions. Now after identifying that which question we are talking about we have to map the particular we have to map the particular question. So this is my question. I have to map this particular question with the function that I have to use and for that I have created that question question mapper",
  "that I have created that question question mapper JSON file. So if I take you back to that particular file uh where is that? Yeah. So over here you can see that I have this particular question with which so this is the key and this is the value this is a value and the value is the name of the question right this is the name of the question that we have to use for this whenever we have been given this question okay now uh so we have this function now this function is in string format okay so I",
  "now this function is in string format okay so I have one other file which contains all my functions use this Okay, I have one other file with the name of functions which contains all these 50 questions which I have created manually. Okay. So these 50 questions uh we have this particular we have the uh are stored in this functions.py file. Now what I am doing is that I will import all these questions all these functions from this particular file to index.py. pi index.py pi and then I will and",
  "to index.py. pi index.py pi and then I will and then I will call these functions whenever uh so I have identified which function we are talking about which question we're talking about so I know that which function I have to use and that's mentioned in that uh JSON document right the JSON file so after getting that so let's say you have uh correctly identified your question you have correctly identified this function you want to use you have that the name of the function so in this case was GA1",
  "the name of the function so in this case was GA1 Q12 right so after identifying this that this is a function we have to use you will be extracting that particular string from the global objects and then calling it as a function so that's one thing that you can check from chat GPT and it it will be able to tell you how you can use a string name this string right we have extracted this from the uh from the JSON object so we have the string Now how you can call this particular string. So this is",
  "you can call this particular string. So this is the name of the function right. So how you can call this function by the name of it by the name of the function right. So this is what you can check from charg after running this function. So this function will be uh it will require some particular parameters right. So these parameters will be run and uh this function will be running in functions.py and it will return me something. It's going to return me with a response and this response I will",
  "me with a response and this response I will be sending back through the index.py file from that end point. So this is the workflow which I am currently thinking about and uh this is how these uh this entire workflow will be working. All these components are connected to each other using uh basic simple imports and uh this is the workflow which I can think about of solving this question. So guys uh do you have any questions regarding this? Yeah. So uh let's uh so this is the explanation part.",
  "So uh let's uh so this is the explanation part. Let's head back to the uh it let's head back to the code. Right. So okay for some reason this is not working. And what we can do is first and foremost let's close this. Okay, it's printing this uh okay it's printing this particular value we have download this entire question it's present over here okay we have the question bank fine what we can do is let's cancel this request at the moment okay this has been cancelled by the user and uh we add",
  "this has been cancelled by the user and uh we add this So uh this time let's see we can so index.py is running and uh this should take uh we should have loaded the position mapper. Let's try this once again. And okay, it has printed this. Yeah, the question bank present. Uh, okay, question bank is ready. Then it should start creating the embeddings. But for some reason, it's not creating the one. Let's check the length of this. Okay, let's do one thing that uh let's uh Um okay it's correct but",
  "thing that uh let's uh Um okay it's correct but it's not creating the embeddings anyway let's not waste our time over here let's just use this basic simple strings and uh so here we are doing the emitting part and it's done now uh now that we have identified uh the question that we are asking them. So now what we should do so this is where we are this is where we are actually send we are using the global uh so globals is actually a dictionary which contains the names of all the variables which",
  "contains the names of all the variables which has been globally defined right so if you uh just print this globals you'll be able to see all the variables present right so from this variable we are just uh uh from this particular dictionary we are calling this particular ular uh function name and I'm passing these values and it should go back to the functions.py. Okay. Uh I'm passing the question and I'm passing the file. Okay. Let's go over here and let's check that if this is working or not.",
  "and let's check that if this is working or not. Okay. So this is done. Let's print something. Okay. Let's print something. Uh, let's print uh action called fine. Let's print this. Okay. Okay. So, this is here and sentence strong. trans so working index.py should work and let's send our request once again. Anyway, let's send a request and let's check if here is it. Let's send it. Okay. Uh, okay. Okay. Okay. So, the thing is that it's not able to find that particular thing. Okay. Uh the thing is",
  "find that particular thing. Okay. Uh the thing is that I actually have to uh I had to use that embedding. Let's do one thing. I'll copy it from here. Transformers and send it once again. Okay, it's hope it works this time. random. Um anyway, uh we have file present over there and should return this. Somehow it's not Okay. So, uh anyway, uh this I have to uh once look into it. So, this should work but it's not working at the moment. So, there might be some uh issue with the how the portions are",
  "be some uh issue with the how the portions are being placed. So, you have to uh look into that. So when you are create when you're using these when you are creating this particular JSON file you have to keep in mind that whatever how so whatever questions that you keep over here in whichever formatting you are using there. So that exact same thing should be present in the sentence transformers file as well. Okay. So that's one thing that you have to keep in mind so uh okay. So this is H that's",
  "to keep in mind so uh okay. So this is H that's not working. Anyway, I have to uh check that once. Okay, so there is some problem with this match value and it's not able to uh run after that. So uh I have to look into that and uh see what's the issue. It's most probably it's with this how the questions are being stored and how they being used. So earlier I used another question formatting uh without removing the the escape characters, the new characters and the multiple space characters. So",
  "characters and the multiple space characters. So that's why it's creating that. So that can be rectified pretty easily but uh it's not working at the moment. So let's move ahead. Let's do one thing. uh what I will do is uh let's search for so this is the particular name of the it's G1 Q this was the name of the function that we had to use this one this one right uh where is it here it is okay so now this particular line should work and it should redirect it should run this particular function",
  "redirect it should run this particular function which present over here. Fine. So let's again send this request and check it. Okay. So it's okay. So it has Okay. So guys can you see this function call? So this means that the connection has been established and this is working. Now uh so the rest of the part is just solving this question and uh so that is what you you guys have to do yourself and uh uh so yeah so this part is done and now the next bit is uh what we have to do is we have to",
  "next bit is uh what we have to do is we have to deploy it. Okay. And for that okay so for that we have created this application. Now for deployment part let's have a look at uh let's ask instead Aure. So in the last session we showed you how you can access Azure education pack and get some free credits. [Music] Yeah. Sign in. It's taking me lot of time to load this. Hello. Hello. I'm a Yes. Audible. Okay. Okay. Let's check on how. So this is a charge response. How to deploy a fast API app on",
  "charge response. How to deploy a fast API app on Azure. So set up your first API app locally. Okay. Requirements txt my project for dependencies. Fine. Uh next is uh okay this is done. Install Azure CLI and login. Okay. This is what to do. Create Azure resources uh app service plan. Deploy your application. Configure startup commands. Access your app. Okay. Um let's check if there is a way to uh deploy it without using the CLI commands. Instead, we can simply deploy it using the UI just present",
  "we can simply deploy it using the UI just present over here. Uh can you also ask how much uh money will it also take or is it free? The thing is that Azure uh on Azure uh you can avail the education pack where uh where you can use the student email ids student email ID and you can get $100 worth of credits for free for one year. Yeah, I know that. But the thing is that last year I had to get my Microsoft certificate. So I had to use my resources. So I am only left with $23. $23. Okay. So I",
  "So I am only left with $23. $23. Okay. So I guess $23 are is a good amount and you can work with that. What I will suggest you is that you should uh be much economic with all your credits, right? So what you can do is uh instead of so one thing that Jibraj pointed out is that instead of uh so what mostly people do is that they run their server their their Azure server and uh they forget to close it and after few so when they forget to close it after a few time a few after a certain duration all",
  "a few time a few after a certain duration all those credits have been consumed and uh you're not able to you know use those credits again. So uh what you can do is run your application locally first. Create your entire application then configure it for Azure and then just just run your server for for some trial runs and then after that when uh if everything is okay just submit it and uh open your Azure server for the uh for the evaluation part. Okay. So that's what I will suggest you. So these",
  "Okay. So that's what I will suggest you. So these $23 can be worked with and uh if you use an economic uh [Music] cash sign in I can see is that uh we have to create an Azure resources. Okay. Okay, asking how we deploy without the commands just using the UI. It's simple. Okay. Azure portal and login. Fine. So, this is the uh this my account over here and create a resource. search for and select app service and then click create a resource. Uh what was it? Uh it is app service. Okay. App",
  "Uh what was it? Uh it is app service. Okay. App service. Uh I guess it's present in this web app. App service. App service. Yeah, there it is. are not closed. Okay. Close. Now click on create. Okay. App service create. App service domain. Let's click on this web app. I think that this is going to work. Okay. Where we are creating a web app. Use app. So yeah. So this is the part. So I guess stat is bit uh just not uh much aware about the current UI of Azure. So currently it's a web app instead",
  "UI of Azure. So currently it's a web app instead of uh app service. So let's create a web app. And for Azure subscription. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh next app service configuration system. Choose a subscription type. Azure student. And add something. Okay. Resource group. Uh there is nothing like that. Web app name. This is going to be TDS project to fine. And uh next res. Okay. So in resource group we have to add something resource group thing is present. Uh fine let's just leave it. Uh name",
  "is present. Uh fine let's just leave it. Uh name publish set to code. Fine. Uh next is runtime stack. It's Python 3x. Python uh let's make it Python 10. So I'm using 3.10 and it would be running on Linux. Yeah, Linux is the only option. Get region Canada, Canada Central. Fine. Uh okay, it's saying that you should choose the region which is closest to you. See, we have something like that. Uh, South India. Do we have North India as well? Uh, there is no North India. So, only uh it's present in",
  "is no North India. So, only uh it's present in only South India. Fine. Let's go ahead with that. Uh, okay. And what we do next? App service plan. Create a new app sering one. Choose the pricing fee. Okay. Okay. It's all about that. uh basic one it's a daily ac which we are getting for free. Okay. So this is the free part and this is 1,500 1,153 INR per month. Let's select this one. Okay. Uh, okay. Let's review and create. Okay. Uh, we are reviewing it. Let's click on create. Next for the next",
  "it. Let's click on create. Next for the next steps, deploy our application. After the app is created, go to newly created app service in the left menu. Deployment center. Okay. Deployment option. Fine. Fine. Fine. It's validating. Okay. So, it's deploying. It's already deploying. Uh, okay. App has been created. Okay. Let's wait for this. Okay, so this has been deployed. Let's wait for this to finish. Okay, deployment is complete. Uh go to resources group. Okay. Open new. All right. So this is",
  "group. Okay. Open new. All right. So this is my dashboard. the I think fine. Okay. So the next step is uh after app is created go to the newly created app service. This is the app service. Okay. Now sorry this is the component that loading. Okay. Let's check. Uh, click deployment center. Deploy center. Yeah, here it is. Okay. Deployment center. Deployment options. Choose GitHub. Okay. So, I have to put it push it on GitHub as well. So, that would be uh fairly simple task. All right. Will it",
  "be uh fairly simple task. All right. Will it only cost money for the model you used like appro $18 per month or will it also cost uh money for each request you will make for it? Yeah. So the thing is that it won't cost you for each and every request. So it will cost you for the server running. Okay. So the only charge is whenever your server is running. Okay. But I guess that you have to charge for uh when a API request has been sent. But generally if your server is running and no request has",
  "if your server is running and no request has been made so you will be charged for that. It's not an exception that if let's say your website hasn't been uh hasn't been accessed by anyone then you won't be charged. So you will be charged because that service is running and uh it's constantly running that uh for you. So yeah it's not like that that only when a request yeah any questions uh Arush? No I just wanted to ask that would it charge if I make a request for it or only the basic charge of",
  "make a request for it or only the basic charge of $18 per month depending on the model you choose. Uh can I please repeat once again? I'm sorry. I uh actually there is a lot of background noise in your wherever you are. I was asking that will it charge me for each request I will make for my server or only the basic model that that is I guess that's what I'm saying that that's what I'm saying so this service it's it will be running your code constantly running your code and it will charge you",
  "running your code and it will charge you for that I don't think that it will charge you run for uh just specifically giving an API request. It will charge you generally for running your file. So yeah, supposed to done now add. Okay. Uh let's take it take us by and make it m first. Got it. Now let's head back to GitHub. public uh create a repository. Copy this. Let's add a remote. Add it. Get push Q or Jim. Is it master or main? Where is it? It's main. Okay. Push you or main push. [Music] Um,",
  "main. Okay. Push you or main push. [Music] Um, yeah, it was master. Fine. So, our GitHub is ready. Our application is over here. Fine. Now let's head back to Azure. Okay. So source is going to be GitHub. Authorize. So this is one thing that whenever you are going to use GitHub for anything you have to authorize [Music] it. Okay. Um okay this is done signed in as this is this organization this and now for the repository we'll be using DDS project 2. Yeah it is branch is master uh building is in",
  "2. Yeah it is branch is master uh building is in Python version Python 3.3 3.10 uh let's check if everything we are doing is right or not. GitHub. Follow the prompt to connect to GitHub. Okay. Okay. Okay. If you're using Okay, got it. Configure startup command. In the left menu, go to configuration. Okay. Uh where is configuration? Configuration. Aure. Okay. User identity basic authentication. I don't need it. Okay. Uh workflow. Let's see. It's asking me to go to configuration left menu. Search",
  "me to go to configuration left menu. Search for configuration. Okay. Workflow configuration file with configuration workflow defined by settings above. Okay. Let's click on preview file for flow configuration. Okay, this is how it's going to present us blocks. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Can I edit this? Oh, I can't [Music] it's system workflow configuration exists. Workflow configuration. Yeah, here it is. configuration in settings your answer will be discarded. Okay, let's save it. I guess it has",
  "be discarded. Okay, let's save it. I guess it has been saved notification. Okay, it's setting up the deployment part. Action build. Okay. No deployments found. If you have just configured refresh logs, it's refreshing. Let's head back to configuration. Fine. Okay. So, what is chat telling us to do is startup command box. Start up. Yeah, it is. Copy this. It's index app post this this this this fine. I don't think that I have to change anything else. Uh it's starting to fix save by restart if",
  "else. Uh it's starting to fix save by restart if you are updating application settings. Continue updating web app settings. Okay, let's check over here. Uh, okay. Okay. Okay. Uhhuh. activity logs. Okay. Uh where is the location where I can see my domain from customer? Let's check this. The IP address is this custom domain. Uh okay. Uh okay. Secute. Is there something I can do over there? Guys, anybody anybody having any ideas how can I access the you can match it with the GPT one now I guess",
  "the you can match it with the GPT one now I guess GPT also showing a sample domain okay okay it's telling to go to the O overview page file overview okay okay okay that was So let's open this. Is it going to work? Uh let's do one thing. Let's send this sentence trans and let's copy this. Let's send a request using this instead. Let's check if it's working or not. Send. Let's hope it works. That will mean our deployment is complete. present over here. Okay, it's taking a lot of time for sure. So",
  "Okay, it's taking a lot of time for sure. So then let's create a basic uh landing page domain uh sorry endpoint as well. GitHub. If we change something in our code, we just have to push it to GitHub. Yeah, absolutely. We don't have to redeploy it again in the resources group. We uh I don't I don't think so because I guess CI/CD pipeline is activated over here. Okay, we have to pull something first. Integrator changes. Okay, so might have changed some things. Fine. Let's close this once. I have",
  "some things. Fine. Let's close this once. I have to pull it. Okay, let's take a backup first. Let's copy and paste. Uh okay. Okay. Sync changes pull and push from origin. What have I changed in GitHub in the first? Ah okay okay okay. So it has added this particular file GitHub for blows file. Uh yeah. So this is a actions file I use. Okay. So let's pull it first. Okay. Ah here it is. So GitHub and then workflows. Fine. This is here. And now I will uh Okay. So it has merged the landing part as",
  "uh Okay. So it has merged the landing part as well. Fine. Let's check if it has Let's check the logs. Can I find logs log street? It's connected. Uh yeah, here it is. Stop side. It failed during startup. Okay. Okay. Start live stream. Okay. Okay. It's failing to start somehow. There is some problem with this and I suppose a lot some kind of debugging. Okay. So what we can do is it's showing us application error because if you are the application you can access the diagnostic server resourc",
  "you can access the diagnostic server resourc Okay. So the resource was not found. It may have been disabled. Okay. If this was launched from pinned title on dashboard should be removed. Okay. There is some problem files. Yes. Uh it is index.py guys just do one thing. So okay it has margin has failed. Why build and deploy Python? Uh okay it has failed for a reason. [Music] Yes. Uh some checks were not successful. Okay. Okay guys, let's do one thing because uh I guess we have to debug this and uh",
  "because uh I guess we have to debug this and uh check whatever uh problems are occurring. Let's do one thing. uh we will so we have covered the demonstration part we have covered uh how you can create those connections between these things so what we can do is to demonstrate the uh perfectly working application uh we'll be demonstrating that in the Thursday's session because if I start debugging it right now it will take a lot of time so let's uh do it on Thursday instead we will we will",
  "uh do it on Thursday instead we will we will present you with a working uh application and then you can uh take uh can you know refer to that application. Okay. So uh for now let's do one thing. Let's uh by the way guys anybody anybody having any questions regarding all this whatever we have for the Thursday section can you also add a question which include folder file which include uploading a file yes sir large file folder sure [Music] by the way guys I will recommend you to uh create a",
  "the way guys I will recommend you to uh create a discourse post where you post whichever questions in whatever GA you are facing the problems with uh in creating this application and uh we will try and uh solve them and then present it to you on the host session because there are a few questions might create some problems but the thing is that most question will require some change of code when we will try it from deployment API Right. So specific change. Yeah. So right now we are also not sure",
  "change. Yeah. So right now we are also not sure how to change our code. So we can't uh also ask you which what doubt we have in this specific question. For example in virtel we know that Linux command can't work. So uh because I uh tested it with the API it was not working. I'm not sure of Azure also. So we can't know as long as we uh try it from there. Yes. And it took lot of time sir. Yeah. Also the uh one problem which I am facing is that you said you will show on Thursday. I have uh OP on",
  "said you will show on Thursday. I have uh OP on Saturday and Sunday. Okay. So it will be hectic for me also. Is there actually actually we have lot of work uh like op vivas and this project also so look what I will what I will suggest you that uh start building all the so there are few so you're saying that there are few problems when you are facing in few questions start preparing the functions for other questions which you are not facing the problem with I already created all the functions.",
  "problem with I already created all the functions. The only thing left is deployment and to test it via deployment. Yes sir. Okay. Okay. Okay. So uh in that case uh look what I can what what you can do is that uh what problems are you facing while deploying that? First of all, I'm the the root is that where to deploy exactly because you are also facing some problem in Azure which you will tell on Thursday. Mhm. And it is also creating some confusion in me also that whether Azure is the right",
  "in me also that whether Azure is the right choice at this point or not and even if you succeed then I will have to change my code according to Azure also right not every code work on every deployment app we have to change uh some bit of it. So that will also require the time. So I can't know what part of my code I have to change for Azure unless until I tried it uh by the API which Azure will give me. Well Azure is giving you these 100 credits $100 credit. So I would recommend you guys to use",
  "$100 credit. So I would recommend you guys to use Azure in this case. And uh so you know you can use digital ocean as well. you can create drop it over there and you can use it but I will recommend you to uh do it on Azure right. Uh so I would say that we will show you that demonstration on Thursday but uh until that keep trying and perhaps you will succeed and you can also demonstrate your application on Thursday session. Sir, I have one doubt. Yeah. Yeah. Sarah, can you do one thing also in",
  "Yeah. Yeah. Sarah, can you do one thing also in the demonstration? Can you include uh a question which is of uh deployment like deployment on version and one question which include file uploading like that's what I'm saying that's what I'm asking you guys to do. You create a discourse post uh instead not create a discourse post uh create a post on the in that thread in that project uh thread and uh mark all the questions which you're facing the problem with and uh we will uh do some sorting out",
  "with and uh we will uh do some sorting out and we will filter out few questions which I which we believe that are generally we should demonstrate and uh in Thursday session we will demonstrate the application with those uh questions specifically. Okay. Yeah. Ask question. Uh sir, I have question regarding the like uh output of the uh request. So can I show you here? Uh you want to share our screen? Yes sir. Yeah sure. So sir it is regarding the G3 question number six. So G3 question number. Yes",
  "question number six. So G3 question number. Yes sir. Just a second. So when I send a post request and here Question number six, I am getting output like this. Mhm. Format but uh it it's not accepted by the portal. If I put this answer in my portal, so it give me incorrect answer. Yeah. Yeah, that's going to happen and uh that's understood. So we will consider that. So you can so whatever answer you are getting that's fine. That's correct. Uh so two things is uh one thing is that in portal uh uh",
  "things is uh one thing is that in portal uh uh so in portal multiple things which are present on the portal that can which you actually answer in the portal you can't send it in an API response right so yeah so that's understood and you can uh use that you can use that code in that's fine whichever whatever answer you are getting at the moment that's absolutely Okay, that uh slashn etc. That's fine. That's fine. Okay, we don't have to give plain answer for that. Like this is working. Yeah, you",
  "answer for that. Like this is working. Yeah, you don't have to. Okay. Thank you. Guys, uh anybody having any other questions? Sir uh actually in Anand's session uh he told us that we can uh upload the file as well that we are having with the questions but in today's session sir told us carton say said that uh the file can be changed and some of students also said that uh file files are different so we need to uh pass the file as well and extract the content Uh can you please why is this issue",
  "the content Uh can you please why is this issue solved? File which are which have large size have to be in the code and file which have which don't have much size uh can be passed. downloaded. Uh uh uh please correct me if uh I am I'm not able to understand you correctly. You are saying that uh uh you are saying that you won't be able to you're saying that uh you won't get the uh the files with the API request. Is that what you're asking? No sir. Actually I'm asking that uh we uh we should uh",
  "Actually I'm asking that uh we uh we should uh pass the file as well in the qu query uh that we for the function so that it can extract that file. Yeah. Yes. That's what I'm asking. So for the large files we we can upload those files with our codes but uh for the low for the less large files we can uh use that function calling for that. Yeah. Yeah. do that. Okay, sir. Anybody having any other questions? Any questions regarding GS7? Because tomorrow is the deadline and uh if you guys have any",
  "is the deadline and uh if you guys have any other questions, just ask right. We have about uh 20 more minutes. I uh but I don't think so. [Music] Okay. Then uh I think that uh it would be fine to wrap up this live session because there are no other questions regarding anything. So we can wrap up the session now. Yes sir. Thank you for joining guys. Uh we'll meet on Thursday. Okay.",

  "Hello. Good evening everyone. Sivans and Alvin. Okay. So, how are you guys doing? Hello. I am facing a couple of problems. Okay. What are the what problems you're facing? Like sir in some question. Um can you give me an example cuz I don't know there were some questions I uh after this actually I'm not I'm not using the laptop right now but uh apart from the project when I gave them this prompt also there also it was struggling to give the right answer. So in those cases like sir are we",
  "right answer. So in those cases like sir are we confident that all the answers if we make the if we make this project completely as per the requirement check GP would be able to solve them all 100% correct with its own uh so uh you all the assignments that you've been given right they were all actually crafted uh by an using charg so he has crafted it using those so the solution set also he has crafted using those. So the key difference is he's got a lot of skill with prompt engineering. Um so",
  "got a lot of skill with prompt engineering. Um so that's why he's able to do it that well. So that's it's not an easy skill to immediately get understand or uh be able to level up. Yeah, I by the way I don't know if it's just me uh or it could be my network but uh it's not very clear what you're saying. Is anyone else having difficulty understanding sir is it clear now? Yeah, you're clear now. Yes. So sir, actually I'm saying that this is more more pro more level up from the project one that we",
  "pro more level up from the project one that we got. The deliverables over there are not this is not like similar. So it might be that I am facing certain time is left for the project. Yeah. Till 31st I think. Yeah. Yes. Thank you sir. Okay. Uh okay. Uh yeah. So next is Gan I think. Yes sir. Good evening. Good evening Kathan. Uh sir. The first thing is I'm still not able to see my project one marks. Okay. Yeah. So there's a reason for that. We are still working working on that. It's a colossal",
  "still working working on that. It's a colossal it's a colossal undertaking. Um part of the issue is u the amount of data we have to pull from DockerHub. It's uh something we I think we underestimated how much we would have to do that. So we have run into various bottlenecks because of that. So we have a requisitioned a VM, we have requisitioned a local server, we have requisitioned uh an NFS folder on uh ITM's network and we have used different credentials to pull things and correct makes sense",
  "to pull things and correct makes sense because I was also checking by myself and for me it was only taking so much time. Naturally I can understand for others multiple kids and the second out was u I understand the project too but the only query is uh the all the five assignments that we have to replicate over here some have like deployment of a opensource LLM like llama as well. So we have to replicate all of those as well. Yeah. So, um I think uh Anand answered that in uh in his um our",
  "think uh Anand answered that in uh in his um our previous Wednesday session. So, if you look up the LA last Wednesday session, did you attend that one or No, sir. I was actually traveling and could not attend. Okay. It's a it's on the TDS uh playlist. Anyway, it's a fantastic session. Uh he's spent uh uh a lot of time well, he spent the entire session discussing project two. So people raised all these questions there. So most you will find almost all your answers to your questions on that",
  "almost all your answers to your questions on that session. Sure. So thank you so much. I'll check it out. Okay. Uh yes talvin regarding is there any update? It has been long. Ah yeah specifically your case right? Okay, give me two seconds. I have uh I have informed uh JK about it before. I'll just ping him again now while we are on this call. Telvin, can you just u put your role number in the chat window, please? No. Yes. I remember you sent a mail pinging both of us as well. So I remember",
  "a mail pinging both of us as well. So I remember reading that. So, it's not like he hasn't seen um I just think he's just uh probably forgotten. It's more like Okay, never mind. I got the email. I'll just uh again um I've done a reply all. He's also in on the email and um so you can see that um I've done that. So you can just check your mail. Um he's um been copied in on it. It was a mail that you sent to him as well. So it's just a friendly reminder. Okay. Uh Okay. So, tonight is uh G7 is due.",
  "Okay. Uh Okay. So, tonight is uh G7 is due. You guys have been working on G7 at all or you've decided not to or I gave up. I did not understand. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Uh what about the others? Okay. Let me Captain I have few more queries. Yeah go ahead. Yeah so first one did were there any session on deployment of project two? Yes I think Sange did a session on uh deployment of project 2 on Tuesday I believe yesterday. H yeah it's not it's not been uploaded yet though. So um I'll as soon",
  "not been uploaded yet though. So um I'll as soon as this session is done I'll put it uh on the website. It is uh ready to publish but uh it has not been deployed yet. Okay. But straight after the session it will be put up. Okay. It might take like 15 minutes or so after this session 15 30 minutes. Okay. And it has mentioned like free account like that accounts based right deployment. um that I'm not entirely sure if he did but uh tomorrow Jiraj will be doing a session as well and uh he might do",
  "be doing a session as well and uh he might do a demo there as well just one second just one second uh so Jiraj informs me that he has already done a a demo with Azure deployment okay so just check one of the previous sessions Oh no, I did not find it yesterday. I did not check that. Yeah. And second thing is that oh sorry one more thing tell me uh he said uh he has done it with digital ocean not specifically Azure but uh you can achieve the same with digital ocean. Okay. No no I need any any",
  "with digital ocean. Okay. No no I need any any Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. uh Delvin actually in that in that session we discussed about how you can get Azure education pack and uh then I used digital ocean to create a VM and then in that I spend I run docker container okay I think it should be last Tuesday's session last Tuesday's session of okay fine I will refer that how to deploy it okay And one one interesting question I have actually I saw this course and I have now more confusion on the JSON file",
  "and I have now more confusion on the JSON file which we have to reply back in product two. So it was mentioned the output should be answer then we have to give a JSON string as an output of project but in this course there are that we have to don't use like slash as an escape character and so what's the conclusion should we give us sing output so okay so uh when see when we run the script. Okay, I'm going to purely talk about it from a technical point of view now so that you understand what's",
  "point of view now so that you understand what's happening. We will run a script. Okay, that script will uh take uh will send uh some request to your endpoint and your endpoint has to respond with a JSON. Okay. Then uh when that answer comes back to us, okay, it'll be some sort of string that we will be getting that string we will evaluate if that produces the correct answer. Now if uh for example the answer requires to be formatted in a very specific way uh where there are some end line",
  "specific way uh where there are some end line characters uh where you know sorry new line characters and things of that sort have to be there for the structure to be maintained. Then what happens on our end is when we get that string we just use a function called JSON loads. Okay. If JSON loads gives us the clean formatted output then that is the correct answer. So the way you test it right is if you run a JSON loads on your answer string do you get the output that will give you the right",
  "you get the output that will give you the right answer for your G. Did you understand that workflow now? Uh no actually like let me tell few cases. Okay. JSON util it will be load using JSON dumps right okay okay give me one second one because uh it's better to make this clear this question keeps popping up again and again and uh I don't know if there's a better way to explain it or not but we will try cuz uh I don't want to keep repeating this actually to be honest um actually there are few",
  "actually to be honest um actually there are few more cases I will tell you can give it uh No, just give me one second. Okay. Uh yeah using second just to share screen Okay, give me give me two seconds. Okay. Uh sir, just to add on to uh point, the same problem seems to be occurring for even markdown outputs. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. So that's why I'm going to just show this once and for all because even though we have explained it, there seems to be perpetuating confusion about this. So",
  "seems to be perpetuating confusion about this. So just give me one second uh so that I can just get set up here. Just give me one second. [Music] Yes. Okay. Okay. I hope uh the screen is visible. Right. So this is um what your endpoint is going to send. Okay. Um I'll just okay for now I'll just say some answer. Okay this is this is a this is a perfectly valid u JSON right so this is what your endpoint is going to respond to us. Okay. Now when you have uh a JSON that has to be in here, right?",
  "you have uh a JSON that has to be in here, right? The problem you will have is your JSON also will have some quotes and things of that sort, right? So one one mitigation is you can do it by sending it this way, right? Using sing possibly using single quotes. That's one possible mitigation. The other way is you like some of you said you might put a slash and you might uh escape out the quotes and things of that sort. Okay, so that's also possible. Now the the key thing to remember is when you're",
  "Now the the key thing to remember is when you're sending this back right on our end we will do JSON loads I mean sorry JSON.loads I think that's called okay and uh some response you will be sending this. So this this is your response. Okay, you're sending this to us. This this response you're sending to us. On our end, what happens is we get it into a variable and we use JSON loads. If JSON loads gives us so this will also give us a variable, right? Uh let's call this U check GA answer, right?",
  "Uh let's call this U check GA answer, right? If this check J answer gives us a string right uh gives us some sort of string and if this if this what we copy and put in there works then that's the correct answer. Did you understand that? This is the this is the thing. The JSON loads that we do on our end to your response that comes out of this variable and gets put into here. This check answer GA answer when we copy and put it into your uh and this is true for all your submissions, right? So in",
  "is true for all your submissions, right? So in other words, if your JSON has strings, okay, that need to be escaped. So, say for example, you've got uh slash something here and it's got um I don't know some ID or something and then of course that has to be a slash also over here and then it's got you know another slash over here uh and then you got um uh some value then another slash okay now when we use JSON loads and you get check GA answer right check G answer will come out cleanly. It will",
  "check G answer will come out cleanly. It will come exactly It'll come out exactly this way. It'll say ID. Yeah. The answer will come out this way, right? This is how it'll come out. This if you put in your uh GA, it works, right? Yeah. So I I want a response from you guys because we keep going in circles about this. Yeah. Let me tell. So uh if my J written written statement has an JSON itself. Yeah. And my response from AP is also a JSON. Yes. This something like this. Yeah. Not not like this.",
  "something like this. Yeah. Not not like this. It's without a string itself. It's not inside a double quotes. Okay. So, you're saying you're sending a clean JSON something like that. Ah, clean JSON. Okay. Without not inside. But you're putting it what inside single quotes. No, no. Just just JSON itself. Okay. So, I will tell the No, no, no, no. See, see, you're going to have to send us a string back, right? You can't when I try to put then it it's not happening properly that it's giving flash by",
  "not happening properly that it's giving flash by default not for just JSON but for everyone program yeah you can't you can't send us a JSON this this inside answer should not be a JSON it should always like str yeah yeah it should be a string because that's what's requested right if you look at the project that is the specific ification. Okay. So for uh questions involving programs or dictionary or a list everything we have to convert it into a string and send it out. Yeah. You have to send it",
  "string and send it out. Yeah. You have to send it to us because we will use a JSON loads. Okay. Right. I mean because it's the same thing that Anand said again on Wednesday's last Wednesday's session. He also addressed this question. If the JSON loads gives us the clean string which is what it will do, it'll give us something like this. This if we copy and paste into the G it will work right no so programing part Python and all we have to have an indentation right so there how it works that's",
  "an indentation right so there how it works that's ah so indentation also will work because when we do a JSON loads it will give us properly formatted string right whenever there are slashes just double inside a double quotes like in a single line right it will give like indentation it will just give slash and Right. [Music] See some some you have to send the encoding to us with the formatting anyway. You can't escape that fact. You understood right my question like yeah yeah yeah you're saying",
  "my question like yeah yeah yeah you're saying yeah. So what I'm saying to you is right when you send send us something that's stringified right something that's in quotes right you're going to have to send us something with the formatting encoded in there whether it's visible or invisible that encoding has to be inside there was a there was a whole uh module in first week G1 about encoding okay and uh there are invisible characters in encoding sometimes right sometimes they are rendered",
  "sometimes right sometimes they are rendered sometimes they are The my point is whatever answer you send back to us if it requires to have for example if it's Python code and needs to have a slash n so that is formatted correctly a slash t or whatever spaces or whatever it is right then that has to be there in the string there is no way for us to imagine what the formatting is going to be right right okay don't just say okay is that right or not you Understand? Yeah, it's right. It's right. I",
  "you Understand? Yeah, it's right. It's right. I understood that point. Okay. So, that's so that's what you have to do. Okay. So, yeah. Print JSON loads of our response and check whether it's been correctly formatted or not. Yeah. Yeah. And uh if it is uh anything that has uh slashs or things of that sort, you have to give that to us because there's no way for us to know the formatting, right? Your formatting has to be there in in as part of the response. If it is for markdown or something like",
  "response. If it is for markdown or something like that. So each and every case we have to ensure that it's been formatted correctly. Yeah. Yeah. You have to give us something correctly formatted. We will then load it on our end and when we load it, it will parse through it. Whether it's a JSON, whether it's markdown, whether it's Python, but you have to give us the formatting encoding. So once the formatting encoding comes in, we will parse it correctly and then we will check your answer. It's",
  "and then we will check your answer. It's as simple as that. Is that clear to everyone over here? Uh sir, so I did try uh doing the same thing for a JSON response uh that I got through one of the GA questions. Uh and uh I getting an error. If it's all right with you, can I share my screen? Okay. then [Music] Uh just a second sir. I'm running into some issue uh with the screen recording uh sorry with sharing my screen sir. Okay. Meanwhile um uh I can show something else that's uh kind of",
  "um uh I can show something else that's uh kind of important. Maybe not for all of you because all of you are not doing G7, right? So, I'll Okay. Okay. Um so J7 when it gets um when you finish um submitting tonight uh J7 is going to be scored in this manner. Okay. Uh first thing is there will be four components to it. Each component will weigh 25% of that G. So first one is a peer evaluation then what are called good reviews. Uh then qualitative and a quantitative. Each of these sections are",
  "and a quantitative. Each of these sections are worth 25% of the G. Um by the way I hope it's visible. Um okay is that can everyone see this? Okay. Um All right. So then um the first component 25 marks you'll have three peers uh to evaluate. Okay. If you do not do any peer reviews, you'll get zero for the whole assignment. Okay. So you have to do some at least some peer review. U you have 10 days to complete the three three peer reviews from when we give you the form. uh then each evaluation",
  "we give you the form. uh then each evaluation that you or in other words so here there are uh so there's Telvin there's uh uh shallini okay uh so imagine uh I have to do the peer reviews I have to do three peer reviews so those are the three I have to do for each one I review I will get six marks okay uh three peers so that gives you 18 marks If you evaluate all three peers, so if I evaluate oops, if if you evaluate all three peers, then you will get a bonus of seven marks. That brings it to",
  "get a bonus of seven marks. That brings it to 25. Clear so far. Uh, is this regarding what I'm talking about right now? Yeah. So, 25 mark for the assignment or No, no, no, no. I'll say again there are four components peer evaluation good reviews qualitative quantitative each of these components are worth 25 marks or 25% of the GA okay so the first one if you do three peer reviews all three of them you will get a total of 25 marks but the way you get 25 is each one of them is worth only six",
  "you get 25 is each one of them is worth only six marks So three peer reviews gives you 18 marks. But if you do all three, you'll get a additional seven which will bring it up to 25. Did you understand that? So if we did not submit the G7 itself, but we can review it, right? No. If you did not submit, you can't review. You won't get marks for the G7 alone, right? Yeah. Yeah. G7. Okay. That's why because this bonus point I thought okay yeah no so is this clear to everyone I I'd like some response",
  "this clear to everyone I I'd like some response yes sir okay next one next component good reviews so you have reviewed three people and if your evaluation score that you give is within plus plus or minus 33% of the average of the other two reviews, then it's considered a good review. You understood this? Hello. Uh, it would be good to know if you understood it. If you if your score that you're giving to a peer is within 33% of the average of the other two reviews received by the peer, then it's",
  "other two reviews received by the peer, then it's considered a good review. Did you understand that? No one's responding. Okay, Vijay gives a thumbs up. Okay, thanks Vijay. Okay, so then some examples are there. You score you give a score of 66 to a student. Uh his average is 67 of the other two reviews that he got. Okay, and that's because that's within 33% it's classified as a good review. Uh another example is you gave a score of 65. The other two reviews were 100. Your review is not within",
  "two reviews were 100. Your review is not within 33% of 100. So therefore, it's classified as not a good review. Okay? So these are the two examples where it's a good review versus not a good review. So why is this important? For each good review, you will also get six marks. So three peers, six marks. For each review, 18 marks. If you give three good reviews, you'll get an additional seven bonus. That brings this component up to 25%. G clear so far. Yes sir. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay.",
  "far. Yes sir. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Third component, you're going to get uh a qualitative and a quantitative u evaluation that uh you're going to be evaluated on. So this is now your submission being evaluated plus what you are going to be evaluating others by. Okay. Um I'll show some examples now soon. So but first I'll go through this. So the qualitative part is 0 1 2 or three marks. So zero marks. If uh so you remember that each of the questions at the bottom had some analysis",
  "of the questions at the bottom had some analysis right. If the analysis does not have the correct interpretation, yes, then that submission gets zero for that uh particular GA question. Okay. So if it's say for example GS 7 question one which was uh I think had to do with um can someone remind me what that was? It was um Huh? It had to do with the pharmaceuticals, right? So if the analysis of that pharmaceuticals uh data set is not correct, then that submission gets zero for that particular",
  "that submission gets zero for that particular question. If the analysis provides some basic interpretation like saying okay uh the everything went up by 2% or something like that something very basic right which anybody can see then you get one point if it provides some unexpected unique insight something that's not immediately obvious okay in the analysis um then and of course there has to be something to back it up it cannot just be words right you look at the visualization what whatever they",
  "you look at the visualization what whatever they have created and if they have some unexpected insight then you give them two. Three you give them if they have gone above and beyond that which is uh they have incorporated some external information sources in their G which compares what they have looked at versus something else that they found interesting that ties it up with the data set that we have given them because all the data sets we gave you were real world data sets. So um we expect you",
  "were real world data sets. So um we expect you to you know gives if you're doing a really good job of it then you're going to be looking at things more than just what we have shown given you in the data set. So for that extra special capability then you can give them three. So that's the rubrics for the qualitative. Six questions were there in the G. Each one can get a maximum of three marks as you can see each of the single questions in the G. That gives a total of 18 marks. If you get between",
  "gives a total of 18 marks. If you get between 10 to 14, okay, so this is your submissions. Remember what you submitted or you're going to submit tonight, right? If you get between 10 to 14 marks in the qualitative evaluation, you'll get three bonus marks for good performance. If you get between 15 to 18, then you'll get seven bonus marks for exceptional performance. Okay, understood so far. This is the third component, the qualitative component. Okay, Jar is on the ball tonight. Jes, if you",
  "Okay, Jar is on the ball tonight. Jes, if you were here, I would uh I don't know, buy you an ice cream. Okay. Right. Uh fourth component, last component, quantitative. Each for each question, a peer, right? has to compute a specific value from your submission. So in other words, you have created some charts, correct? And you have used your data set to create that chart. Now you might have bungled up your data set, right? You might have done it in a in a wrong manner and computed a wrong piece",
  "in a in a wrong manner and computed a wrong piece of information. So visualization looks great. Uh but maybe your calculations are wrong. So that is what this checks is your underlying data set calculations correct. So for each question that is there are there were six questions in your G the peer has to compute a specific value from your submission. Okay. If that value is present in your submission you will receive three marks. So the six questions three marks gives you a total of 18 marks. If",
  "three marks gives you a total of 18 marks. If you get all 18 marks you will get seven bonus marks. So this is how they will grade your submission and this is how you will grade their submission. These these two components qualitative quantitative everyone clear with this fourth component then I'll show you some examples. Okay Jesba thank you. So you'll get a form that's exactly like this. It'll probably look a bit better for you. You'll have to create you'll have to submit three of these forms",
  "create you'll have to submit three of these forms for each of the three peers. The three peers you will review, we will send you an email who those three peers are that you have to u uh do a review for. So you have to fill this form three times, one for each of those peers. So for example, question 7.1, right? So we'll ask you some computational question right which you have to get the value from their submission okay and um you fill that value here then you do the qualitative assessment okay",
  "here then you do the qualitative assessment okay so u the things that I showed you earlier so then you have reviewed question one of G7 of your peer okay similarly there'll be other ones That's how the qualitative and quantitative works. You'll have to do that for six questions and overall you'll have to do that for three submission. That's your review process. Their qualitative and the quantitative. Okay. Is that clear now? Okay. Sir, I think only Jwar has had dinner today. Okay. Right. So",
  "only Jwar has had dinner today. Okay. Right. So that's uh that's all I have with regards to introducing uh the scoring system for G7. Okay. Uh back to Uh can I share my screen sir? Yeah you can go ahead and share screen. Yes sir. So for this question this particular uh question [Music] for what's the JSON description for that particular city name. So for se all this is the uh output I'm getting and I try to pass using JSON loads just like you said. So I put this into a variable called response",
  "So I put this into a variable called response and I try to pass some words. We got a error. Yeah, the object must be a string. It says it's not a string. That's what the error is. This is why I keep saying you have to send a string in. Your response must be a string. Got it. So, so at the end of the function uh it should be return string of whatever the see. Yeah. See, if you look on your uh if you look in your import JSON and response, right? Yes. Your uh your quotes uh are they being escaped",
  "Your uh your quotes uh are they being escaped correctly? Uh yes sir. Ah okay. So so here's one more thing. The um response you're getting back that uh is not uh not a string, right? Yes, let me check because um if I remember correctly, we had done a demo in one of the uh sessions also with JSON dumps and JSON loads. Yes. So this is not a so it's returning a JSON dumps straight away. So I probably might have to convert that into a string and give the output. Yeah. Yeah. And on the same thing I",
  "the output. Yeah. Yeah. And on the same thing I have a few more uh questions as well. So for uh this particular question in G4 Q uh question 10. So said that to do some manual corrections and then the output is to be taken from a input PDF file and that how we how would we be able to do manual corrections sir? Yeah. So with manual corrections we will be uh we will so the reason why that was said over there is initially the grading criteria for the G itself was very very strong. So there was",
  "the G itself was very very strong. So there was only a very small percentage of errors that were allowed. Uh what Anand did then was he relaxed the grading criteria for that question. So instead of say let's say for argument sake you were allowed to make only two mistakes or something he allowed it so that you could make uh three mistakes per line or something. Okay I don't remember the exact criteria but he relaxed the criteria so you're allowed to make more mistakes in your submission. So",
  "to make more mistakes in your submission. So that's exactly what we will do as well. We for tough questions like this where manual corrections were necessary before we will allow for more mistakes to be made this one so that you can pass that particular question so that manual correction is not required. You understand? Yes sir. Yes sir. I got it. And uh similarly for markdown outputs uh all the hash uh and all the spaces in case if the output has a slash or uh an escape line or a next line in",
  "a slash or uh an escape line or a next line in that case it'll be passed into what exactly because uh for example here it's line by line but most has an output API endpoint it's more or less like a single paragraph with slash questions. Yeah. So, we will Yeah. So, mark markdown. See, when you send this text to us, right, it's still going to have to be a string that is formatted correctly with the slash and whatever it is, the encodings that require it to be quoton code formatted correctly. So",
  "it to be quoton code formatted correctly. So um as long as your output is formatted with the encoding like the end lines that are required or the tabs or whatever of the spaces then from our end our evaluation script will manage that without any issues. Got it. Yeah. If you go back by the way go back to your JSON loads I remembered something else. Just go back to your Yes sir. Um so you see I've written response there that is not the that's not the right uh thing we'll be loading right we'll be",
  "right uh thing we'll be loading right we'll be loading the stuff that is inside the answer so the the key the key is answer we'll be loading the value in so it's uh so it's this thing whatever after answer is it's you're loading the entire thing yeah got it sir So if you load that as a string, yeah, you have to put it has to be in a string. Yes, it is. Then it should load correctly if it's a properly stringified. You'll have to check what uh Okay. But we have demonstrated that in the session as",
  "But we have demonstrated that in the session as well. So uh is there any specific date available for the session? So just so that I can go and verify uh one second do we have a transcript of uh previous sessions all previous sessions? 17. Oh not after that. Okay. Yeah. So, um I'm not exactly sure which session uh because we haven't transcribed some of the later sessions that happened afterwards. Uh I'm not sure which one it is, but it will be in one of these recent ones only. It won't be you",
  "in one of these recent ones only. It won't be you can just watch at like 3x or something. Oh, I'll give you a better idea. Instead of watching at 3x and all that in uh if you go to the TDS module where we talk about LLMs, right? Yes, sir. there we have given a workflow of uh how to transcribe a video right? Yes sir. Yes sir. Yeah you can do the transcription yourself. It's free of cost uh using Gemini uh uh 1.5 or something like that's what we use anyway. It's you can just use that uh using u",
  "use anyway. It's you can just use that uh using u um I think it's Google studio Google AI studio you use Google AI studio use Gemini uh 1.5 do the transcription yourself take the video transcribe it whichever ones are missing and use the prompts we used because that's why we gave the example use the prompts use it will summarize the session for you it'll tell you exactly these things were discussed in this session and uh these were the questions that were answered and then that will solve your",
  "that were answered and then that will solve your problem Yes, that's a good good exercise for you guys because that's a skill that you can use in even in your real life uh uh work, you know, what uh being able to summarize and transcribe videos. So yes sir and for this particular question G4 uh question two. So it says that IMB search results may differ by region. And I remember while actually trying to do the graded assignment, I made a lot of changes like for example hyphens and uh some of",
  "changes like for example hyphens and uh some of the variables and some of the numbers and the movie titles depending on uh what was expected here. So based on the error I modified it the movie individually and I got a correct answer for this question. So how does proceed for this? Yeah. Again, uh any place where there are manual uh issues, issues of manual corrections, we will be a little more um softer with the errors. That's the that's the mitigation that we will do on our end in the G itself",
  "that we will do on our end in the G itself because we wanted you to do the exercise. So, it was the grading criteria was harder. But um it is so that you are aware of the issues that you will face when you're facing real world data sets, right? real world data sets are terribly messy, right? So it's not nice and clean like uh like things in school. So it's that's why we uh kept the grading criteria strict for the G itself. But from for the project evaluation, we will be softer with these kinds",
  "evaluation, we will be softer with these kinds of evals because you will not be there to manually correct it. Right? So we'll be more forgiving. We'll allow more mistakes in these Okay sir. Uh and uh I have another question regarding uh Enro. So I have somehow managed to host the entire uh thing on AWS and it's working fine for me and fantastic and s for all the individual questions uh there are some questions that do send a post request or get request to a API endpoint. So those questions I",
  "request to a API endpoint. So those questions I was m I think G4 question three uh for that particular question it we had to like uh send a API URL endpoint uh into the as our uh as a string in the response. So for that what I did was I created a demox session and then I run it on local host and then using enlock I forwarded that into a public uh port and uh detached from the session and and it's still running right now and when I actually put that URL into the graded assignment at any given",
  "that URL into the graded assignment at any given time it's uh giving me a correct response. Yeah, brilliant. That's exactly what we want. Yes, sir. And how many kinds of tunnels? So I was not able to create another tunnel. It's that I can only do one. I can only So correct. So Enro will only allow you one. That's uh Yes sir. So is there like uh some there are several different pricing plans. So I am confused as as to which pricing plan I should choose in order to get access to more tunnels. Uh",
  "choose in order to get access to more tunnels. Uh yeah, you shouldn't require more tunnels. See, as long as your hosting service responds to endpoints, then that's all we really require. Uh yes, sir. But for there are a few more other questions where we have to uh send um a request as in name is equal to X uh and name is equal to Y. And then we have another uh endpoint question based on similarity. Uh and there's one more question in that same let me guess. They all use the same port number.",
  "let me guess. They all use the same port number. Yes sir. Yes sir. So right now my point is uh I what I initially thought was I'll create a different uh enro tunnel URL for each of the questions. Is it possible for us to do everything together and put it in one single uh URL? Will it actually technically speaking work sir? [Music] No, because No, because um when you have a single endpoint and it's tied to a single port, uh you will be you'll be requiring different outputs from the same",
  "be requiring different outputs from the same endpoint, right? So that will not work if you're giving the same endpoint. See, you will have to give different endpoints, right? Yes, sir. And in that case uh which means that I have to have more enro tunnels because I tried to do the same procedure that I did for AWS. So apparently for sending the API URL endpoint there is some sort of an error because it's okay wait. Uh can you show me the question because before we get carried away with this uh",
  "because before we get carried away with this uh which question? No, you're saying you wanted uh so can you show me the question where uh you need an endpoint? Um you're trying to trigger an end point. So show me one of those. Just a second. cuz if I'm not mistaken supply any for example this question we need a uh endpoint for this particular question this is definitely not possible to host on versus because a input file and it started getting no no no you can no uh because uh we can always",
  "no no no you can no uh because uh we can always process files in memory. This was also addressed in a previous session I think last Wednesday. This was uh yes sir but this uh B uh this JSON file itself differs from person to person. So I verified with a friend of mine. So his file is different from mine. So when he says name is equal to x and name is equal to uh y I get a different output and he gets a different that's not a problem right because we send you the file anyway. Uh so I can use",
  "we send you the file anyway. Uh so I can use this particular file itself. No no we send you the file in the post request. Uh yes sir. Uh but if we but is it possible to send a file in as a post request to a versal application? So that's my point. Why not? Has uh anyone else tried? See, don't worry about this particular application. What I'm saying is what I'm saying is if you're uh sending uh just send a file to a vers endpoint. Don't do anything special with it and see if it uh accepts the",
  "special with it and see if it uh accepts the file in the postcript. Hang on just a second. So there was a session so I've been informed there was a session where that was demonstrated as well where there was a versel hang on sorry all right sorry uh let me clarify so we have tested it you can send a file to versel uh extract it and it works. Okay, you just have to do that. Whereas the fancy processing that you require, keep that aside for a minute. Just try to get a file to versel endpoint and",
  "Just try to get a file to versel endpoint and extract it. Try that first. If that works, you have achieved the first step. Then you start working on the problem of giving the expected response back. But as far as the sending a file to versel, we have tested it here and it works. So we know that you can send a physical file as a post request to versel endpoint. Got it sir. I will do that thing. Okay. Uh so uh I just have like one more question sir. As far as enrock tunnels are concerned uh like",
  "As far as enrock tunnels are concerned uh like uh I tried to do it on Windows on a Windows laptop. I was not able to do that as come. Okay. Okay. Let me let me stop you there. Right. We we're going back to this enro business. So far I haven't seen a use case where you've shown where you need a more than one enro tunnel or anything. Um just a second sir. I'll take the question that I'm talking about. Sure. Yeah. uh many cuz Enro you're allowed only one unless you of course pay for it but that's",
  "one unless you of course pay for it but that's your call if you want to but uh I can't say that's a solution for everyone because not everyone can afford to do that so we are looking for free answers but if you want to pay and do it that's your call yes sir for this question sir so here also you just need an endpoint right yes sir So you can create any endpoint. It doesn't have to be this specific endpoint. The main thing is we will send a request to this endpoint, right? And it should provide",
  "to this endpoint, right? And it should provide us the expected response. So we'll send a post to that particular endpoint with that doc and query string and uh we are expecting some sort of response back from it. So I for this question I can in that case I can host it on uh versel itself. Yeah, you can host on Versel or any endpoint you want. We just want an endpoint. It doesn't have to be that specific endpoint. Got it. Right. So there's no need for multiple end groups. You got Okay. Sir in",
  "for multiple end groups. You got Okay. Sir in the same assignment. Mhm. Uh in the same assignment question number eight when we provide end points. So there are certain limitation in this question like it's provided limited queries and okay okay okay wait wait wait you'll have to first show me the question brother okay just a So sir this is the question example queries are given. So when we provide endpoint here so it query but not all queries which accepted by the portal since here are only",
  "which accepted by the portal since here are only certain queries are present. So how do we this like so this box there are certain uh which portal is accepting. Yeah. The name uh of the function will be for example get ticket status and you have five quer five functions there right? Uh yes sir. Yeah. So what what is the specific issue you have? like sir uh it's sending queries to different uh like uh query points like after the question mark Q then it's sending get request to different like uh",
  "it's sending get request to different like uh ticket status or like uh you can say uh so you have to encode those endpoints on your server right like sir I added all these all these queries here present here but uh it also looks for other queries like here report official issues also present but uh it also checking for complaint issues or some other queries which are not present in the question. Uh they are changing dynamically sir. Oh okay. Okay. I understood. So you're saying not everyone has",
  "I understood. So you're saying not everyone has the same uh set of queries uh encoded. You're saying another student has another set of five functions. Is it? No sir. No sir. I'm saying whatever the present in the question like uh this is defined functions so I defined in my question uh in my function but uh there are certain queries which are out of these functions uh which are yes sir so when you when you do a check on this right yeah you're saying that it doesn't check for those five",
  "saying that it doesn't check for those five functions is it which uh this g which one G3 server like it's sending queries for function related you can say complaint issues not present here okay this uh I was not aware of one second during GA submission it is working but now it's changing I check queries in the terminals Okay. So during your normal J it checked against those five uh functions. Is that correct? Yes sir. Yes sir. It's working that way. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's okay. Then just",
  "way. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's okay. Then just encode for those five questions only. I mean five defined fun. That's why I was confused because see what's going to happen is while uh because now this GA is not live anymore, right? So some changes might be occurring in preparation for next term. So that's why at the moment it might be that uh it's checking for functions that are not specifically defined out there. So but uh I would assume if you looked at that question right it specifically",
  "you looked at that question right it specifically tells you those those functions are what are defined correct. So I would expect it to work for those particular functions only. Uh yes sir that's my sir there are certain limitation of the portal uh sorry deployment portal like in Azure we have limitation of uh subprocess like we can't use subprocess to process any background uh background endpoint or uh like like there are certain limitation regarding the file size like there are files uh which",
  "the file size like there are files uh which contains uh which are 61 MB file So yeah, so large uh so that is you're talking about uh receiving right? Receiving files. Yes, receiving as well as uh like uh if we put in the container so it's not working the container. Oh, so the container doesn't allow for larger than 4 MB is it? Yes sir. to store I tried to I tried to increase the limit but IMV not more than that okay I'm not aware of the that limitation for azour specifically uh yes sir we are",
  "for azour specifically uh yes sir we are like have you checked in digital ocean what if we have any site okay so there are many limitation at various deployment portal so we are checking at Azure Azure itself is very slow. So we don't know how much time will like uh digital ocean will take. Yeah. So slow means uh I didn't understand what you meant by slow like whenever we are pushing uh our project. Ah okay. So it's take lot of time sir. Yeah. So don't push a project. Okay. So don't see this is",
  "don't push a project. Okay. So don't see this is another thing right? Don't push a project to the server until you have it running functioning well on your local system right because then it's just a matter of deployment right actually sir I tried all my function working at local system then I push but there are some question which shows limitation at the deployment part so we have to modify those question then again deployment and then same process again also the GitHub questions are working",
  "again also the GitHub questions are working at the like local system and I tried everything but not working at SEO. Okay. Yeah. Because of this question because of the CLI type questions. Yes. Yeah. And not just CLI anything that involves process or files those URL expos. It's not working. Okay. Even is not working like handling somewhat. I figure out end point but sir uh not like not get like questions. I figure out question how to handle 10 points. Okay. Uh give me two seconds. Okay. Pr on",
  "points. Okay. Uh give me two seconds. Okay. Pr on this call? Yes. Yes. Uh, do you want to answer that question? How they could possibly deal with? Uh, can you repeat the question again? Hello. My question sir? Yes. Uh sir we don't know which platform is good for like deployment to handle all these questions. There are many questions which are like not working at deployment part like GitHub questions. So uh is there something which you have already uh aware of or work through? Is it not is there",
  "uh aware of or work through? Is it not is there something a framework that you're already uh trying out? Um if you ask about benchmarking solutions, each one will have a different way uh be it uh with respect to individual each framework has its own uh pros and cons but uh if you have a specifically few frameworks it's it will be easy for us to understand and recommend on what okay so what what are the frameworks you tried Like sir uh for the GitHub related question uh I run at local system",
  "GitHub related question uh I run at local system they are pushing committing and everything is working at uh local system but uh whenever I tried on Azure it is not working for those questions. So when you said deployment uh via Azour so do you did you have like an Azure VM and then tried this out or uh I am using Azure web services where I deployed my whole project okay it's vers right uh Azure sir as it's been using the uh for CD you have been using uh you Not audible. Am I audible? Uh",
  "been using uh you Not audible. Am I audible? Uh audible but your voice is too low. No idea. Uh once let me check at my end. So Lakshmi one thing uh I was going to mention. So you know the GitHub questions they don't have to use CLI. Okay. You can just use the GitHub API. We actually demonstrated that in one of the recent sessions executing the lot of errors at deployment part otherwise working at uh like local machine I tried with my friend also he also like no but we de we demon no what I'm",
  "he also like no but we de we demon no what I'm saying is we demonstrated the GitHub uh uh any GitHub type questions we did did a working demonstration of that uh using API rather than using CLI commands using the GitHub API. Okay. Right. So that's not using CLI, right? That's not using subroscess. So those you can sub those you can uh solve using the GitHub API itself. There is one library I used g Python instead of subprocess. So that's also not working. That is your Yeah. So that may be the",
  "working. That is your Yeah. So that may be the library but I'm saying the API you understand the difference right the API is GitHub as it yeah so GitHub as an API if you interact directly with the API you can uh do almost all types of GitHub actions just interacting with the API all right okay so that should work because we did do a demonstration of that particular thing what about larger file server yeah the larger file thing. I don't have an answer just at this moment. Uh that I'll have to",
  "answer just at this moment. Uh that I'll have to get back with you on. Okay. Maybe Prasana might have a suggestion for you. This is on the Okay. First we'll address on the previous question. So you have is my better now? Yes sir. Yeah. So uh coming back with respect to deployment you have tried with uh Azour DevOps. So essentially Azour pipelines with personal right. Yes sir. Okay. So if you're looking for alternate options apart from Azour uh uh DevOps I think uh see it comes back to again",
  "uh DevOps I think uh see it comes back to again GitHub actions. It can come again to GitLab runners. So there are uh different platforms you could try. But uh the suggestion I would provide you a suggestion uh since you have already started with Azour DevOps. If you find it difficult, you may post it in discourse. You can tag me directly. We can try to sort out with the respect to a specific error. But with respect to platforms, there is nothing like u um the best platform or best one best tool",
  "like u um the best platform or best one best tool which we can use. So each one have from a cost perspective or from a uh uh feature perspective which is uh specifically different. There is no fixed tool that uh you can use for deployment. Okay sir. Now coming back to the second one which is a larger files. So uh uh the challenge here is in how to process these larger right? Yes sir. And uh yeah when we say put access okay put access with respect to AP uh uh file attachment. I think what is the",
  "to AP uh uh file attachment. I think what is the max size limit that we can attach to the specific request? Let me check that. So Lakshi I was just speaking with Jira about the file you're saying there is large files there's only one right? Yes in the G. Yeah, one one file say there are two three questions based on okay so that one file is a static file right it's not dynamic in other words everyone will get the same file correct correct sir okay what you can do in that situation it's very",
  "okay what you can do in that situation it's very simple it's a very straightforward solution you process the file beforehand itself because you know what the file is going to be keep a very small version of that file in CSV format or something and then Just process the request when the request comes in. Don't don't process a large file, right? Okay. That can be alternate solution. Yeah. So that that can be a way around the problem like I sold 80% of the project but certain there are certain",
  "80% of the project but certain there are certain limitation at the deployment area. Yeah. So that uh that is a way to get around that problem. Don't process it at all. Just um you already know the file. It's static. It is not going to change uh from student to student. So pre-process it and keep keep it so that you can just respond to the question when the question arrives. Okay sir. Thank you. Yeah. Queen crossing file means that file will be not changed at all right for that GA. Yeah, that is",
  "changed at all right for that GA. Yeah, that is a that is a static file. Again uh this is something Anand addressed in the previous uh session which was uh check with your peers which files will change which files don't and I can guarantee you that 60 GB 60 megaby file is not going to change that's a very static yeah it's not changed by while while sending the request will send the same May 2024 file itself that's what I want uh the file will be exactly the same that you guys have it is not",
  "be exactly the same that you guys have it is not going to change for okay okay And uh only the dynamic only the dynamic files those will change the small tiny files that we sent. Okay. Yeah. And one more thing for image files some are having like textual image right those would be in PNG right you would be saving and saving right? Mhm. So PNG uh you have to use um you might have to use uh a JavaScript library for those. No, you will be sending us a P file itself or like how? Yeah. Yeah, we'll",
  "us a P file itself or like how? Yeah. Yeah, we'll send you a file. You will not be G like strapping it. Just you will not be giving like templates, right? No, right. I didn't understand. Could you say that again? No, no, you will not be giving like HTML template or like that stuff, right? Image you're talking about, right? No, no. Image embedded in like G8. So, for example, in GA2 and all. Ah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Yeah, we will send you the image for those file it. Yeah. Yeah. Because uh",
  "image for those file it. Yeah. Yeah. Because uh we because normally what happens is we expect you to download the image, right? To process that. Yeah, that's why. So we would Yeah. So we would send you the image. We won't send you the HTML. And link files also most cases the files would be available as an attachment, right? Yeah. Most most of them would be. Yeah. Okay. Please be lenient. Yeah. And for JSON I tried as you recommended how to pass it but it's not working at all. I can share the",
  "it but it's not working at all. I can share the screen and show you how it's feel. Okay. Can I share? Yeah. Yeah. So for GA3 3 4 question number three we need a JSON body itself. Yes. Okay. So this is the results which I gave and it gave correct during my and I am processing using that files and returning a response as well as loading it like you write JSON.load of response. Mhm. So I got this okay this response and from my end point or URL where we get response it's been showing as slash",
  "where we get response it's been showing as slash escape character like we have an JSON right like said yeah okay okay but so actually what I guess is that if I copy this output that's the second print statement and paste it here this as you Right. Yeah. Am I correct? Yeah. But uh this is not uh this has not been formatted, right? This is JSON, right? Yeah. I'm just having a look. Is there any differences? Because the thing is I'm not sure what the differences are between the two. Yeah, because",
  "differences are between the two. Yeah, because both are JSON itself. That's why here it's not working at all. No, no. Yeah, but I cannot see I cannot make out just by looking like this if they are exactly the same or not. So I can't tell you 100% for sure this is correct or not. Look this value is correct because I just inserted this thing. Uh I can print it and the thing is I have to take your word for it right and I've learned this lesson many times normally. No I can I can show you the",
  "many times normally. No I can I can show you the processing what I did also. Okay I can give you so I store the JSON JSON. No no I look look I I understood all that. Okay you store the JSON. What I'm saying is that value right? I can't make out those two are exactly the same or not. the what you had in your uh in your uh GA versus what you have printed out now are they precisely same I can throw it out now it's okay but to like when I do this yeah can you okay can you do one thing can you like",
  "can you okay can you do one thing can you like prettyify it and uh see what it looks like and compare the two you know do you have a way to in other words compare the two JSONs are exactly equal If they are not online, cuz that's the first thing I would check. Just this single quotes that's here double quotes. The single quotes is that's the only difference. Let me try this. Uh hello. Yeah. Uh yeah. Uh can you copy that output to VS Code? The one after loading after JSON loads. Okay. Yeah, this",
  "after loading after JSON loads. Okay. Yeah, this is output, right? Yeah. Just create one new file. Okay. Yeah. Paste it and uh format it. Uh left click it. Uh right click. Right click. Okay. Okay. Uh now can you press Okay. Uh leave. Leave it. Uh can you press Ctrl H? Okay. Control H. and put single quotes in the above one. Okay. And double quotes in the below one. And replace all. Uh can you copy this G? Uh okay. There is this false as well. It should be a small letters. Which one? Yeah. So if",
  "should be a small letters. Which one? Yeah. So if you look at uh the difference additional properties okay that was earlier false but if you look at uh in the second one okay but I just plotted the JSON right then will it change? No, no, no. It won't change. Like, so after doing JSON loads, are you able to access model? Can you try to access model on line number 180? This one line number 180. Can you try to access model from this JSON loads? Okay, this model. Okay, like okay, like I will Yeah.",
  "this model. Okay, like okay, like I will Yeah. They're trying telling to do this. Yeah. Yeah. This one. Yeah. Yeah. Uh did you press submit button? No, no, no. It's uh processing. It's taking the building. Okay. And that processing time was for just initiating there. Okay. Yeah, it prints uh GPD4 mini then. Yeah, it is a valid JSON. Yeah, only this false is because we load this one, right? That's Yeah, because it is inside Python. Yeah, that's why. So, why it's not working? uh it's not working",
  "So, why it's not working? uh it's not working because so what you are printing is JSON loads uh which is actually loading that uh string into your Python program. So Python treats small fals in JavaScript and in Python it is capital F. Okay. So if I change this one and try it here it should work right as you said. It's sugar. It's not JSON loading itself is not working as Kelvin the um uh evaluation script that we will run right it will parse that anyway pass single quotes to double quotes okay",
  "anyway pass single quotes to double quotes okay then if we have like single quotes itself in JSON then how see just make sure that the JSON loads works correctly. Okay. Like I which I did right. Yeah. Okay. Fine. Okay. As long Yeah. As long as uh the JSON body loads correctly in JSON loads, we will pass it on this end so that it will uh not trip on these small small things. Okay. Okay. But uh this answer here I just try with answer but actually we have to try with your response right JSON it",
  "we have to try with your response right JSON it would be sorry could you repeat that again? Yeah. No, actually here we tried with answer because we had to pass JSON answer right in actual case of evaluation you will be passing the response to JSON and whenever you want a JSON output or the dictionary like things you will be loading using right yeah yeah okay for string and others you will not do correct yeah I just got confused other things also this Python would be like same thing. Okay. So",
  "this Python would be like same thing. Okay. So I'm going to um um so tomorrow we have a session. Okay. And that will run from 8 to 10. So we'll pick up this session again tomorrow. U so because it's already 10:30 now. Um the only other thing I was going to say is if you there are any things you would like us to demonstrate cuz tomorrow I think it's the last session before the deadline. Correct. So if there are any things you want to be demonstrated tomorrow, uh what I would suggest is you post",
  "tomorrow, uh what I would suggest is you post on discourse uh specifically saying you know what are the things you want us to address in that session and then we will try and address those in that session. So if you want a working de if you want a working demo something specific then we can have that shown for discussions can it be shown like yeah yeah yeah so what I'm saying is don't just say it here put it on discourse right and uh then we will take a look at the posts on discourse and we'll",
  "take a look at the posts on discourse and we'll tailor the session tomorrow to demo those specific things okay and do we have any support session for the plant issues like that like one I I didn't quite hear that last sentence it wasn't clear in project one we had support sessions right just one day before while facing issues during deployment or [Music] no no not particularly no because we've conducted many sessions on project two actually so I I don't think it'll be necessary okay Yeah sir.",
  "I I don't think it'll be necessary okay Yeah sir. Yes Li. Uh is there any solution project uh like you can show us after like uh this evaluation part evaluation of this project? Yeah, we are actually creating a solution for it like uh on not on local machine like show us on like on deployment portal whatever. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks guys. Um, we'll see you tomorrow and like I said, if you got any particular questions you want de a demo on, uh, we'll try and show them tomorrow. So, put it",
  "uh, we'll try and show them tomorrow. So, put it on discourse and we'll go through that and have something for you guys tomorrow. Okay. G7 is not mandatory, right? No, no, I mean like that none are mandatory. uh only four out of seven G's are necessary to be eligible for the end term as long as you have 40 and above. I got 600 600 or 600 this one then it's yeah then it's not not not required. Okay. Okay. Thanks guys. Have a good night. Thank you. Thank you.",
  "===== VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Nrm9gor3Thk =====",
  "Okay. So, good evening everyone and uh today's session um the TA will be doing a demo of uh some of the more difficult issues in project two how to solve it. Um you know some of you say you cannot use versel to do certain things. Uh they said u they have tried it out themselves and it's possible. So they will show how these things are possible. um any of the difficult issues or questions. Uh I have a list in fact that they have sent me and uh let me see here the list [Music] says two seconds.",
  "me see here the list [Music] says two seconds. Okay, I'll um I'll let them tell you what there's a specific list of things that they were going to show you um that they had sent uh that they'll try and cover for today. uh at the moment for some reason I'm not able to pull that up. I'm not sure why it's probably okay. Yeah. So the thing the things on the list are J1 question 3, J1 question 8, 13, J2 3 question 3, J2 question 6, J2 question 8, J2 question 10, J4 question 7, J4 question 9, J5",
  "J2 question 10, J4 question 7, J4 question 9, J5 question three. So those are the uh most challenging ones that most people have uh asked about and so these are the ones uh that they have decided to uh showcase for you. Okay. So hopefully that will then resolve any other issues that you guys have. And uh just uh as a since we started the recording a little bit later just as a summary before uh this recording started I was mentioning the fact that there is a post available uh that details out",
  "there is a post available uh that details out issues with string outputs uh whether it's multi-line whether it's formatting whether it is markdown whether it is JSON whether it's JSON with spaces without spaces. uh this post clearly mentions what we expect. So if you are having trouble with those figuring out should slashn be there not be there um this post explains all that. So for example, this multi-line has slashes. But guess what? You can't see it because they are invisible, but they are",
  "see it because they are invisible, but they are encoded in the string. So they exist, right? It's just that you can't see it because browsers are designed with user friendliness in mind. So they hide them. Uh but it actually exists. And so we I've explained in the post how you deal with it. And I also proven that you will get the exact same output that you expect. uh to be able to be used in a G. Okay. So, as long as your output matches what we are showing over here, then you'll be fine. So,",
  "are showing over here, then you'll be fine. So, that's uh all the things that we uh basically covered uh before this recording started. Okay. Uh are you guys uh ready? Are you guys ready? Okay. Few more minutes I suppose. Okay, they'll be ready in a few more minutes. Right. Um, okay. Any other doubts I can take while they are still doing the setup? By the way, did uh did you guys attempt G7 at all? we'll be releasing uh the review um rubrics. Uh I mentioned them yesterday's session. Uh I think",
  "I mentioned them yesterday's session. Uh I think they've been uploaded already the sessions. So in case you don't understand how the G7 is going to be evaluated uh we'll be sending out some rubrics to you today uh tonight and uh the explanation for that has been given in yesterday's session. So watch yesterday's session if you want to understand how they work. Okay. Uh so is there anything else we can discuss today? Um Shalini, Cheswar, Praep, Ritik, Sakshi. Uh yes sir. So yesterday we spoke",
  "Ritik, Sakshi. Uh yes sir. So yesterday we spoke about uh running multiple enrog tunnels in the free version of Enro and except you can't right you can't run multiple. We can that's what you can. Yes. Yes sir. Okay. Okay. If you can then that's great. Yes. So, but you do not you cannot directly uh run it uh in the sense like uh for example if you're giving the command uh enro http8000 uh you cannot run a similar uh tunnel using the same command like in one of the terminals http 8000 is uh",
  "like in one of the terminals http 8000 is uh running and another terminal I try to run at80 instead of uh uh as a new tunnel. It it doesn't work that way. So what I am supposed to do is uh so there's something called a yiml file for enrock. So you create and then you specify what are all the different ports that you want to utilize and then you run a single command uh with enro. So all so it's a sing okay so it's a single tunnel. Yes sir. Which is but you got different ports that it listens to.",
  "but you got different ports that it listens to. Yes. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yeah. So, so in other words, it's still what what I said is true, right? You can't run multiple tunnels. You can only run one tunnel. Correct. Correct. Yes. Right. Right. So, it is one tunnel uh but with different ports that it listens to. Correct. Correct. Yeah. That is uh that is possible because um then you can run different applications on each port. So, that uh that's a good workound. Yeah. Thanks uh for that. Uh so Jes",
  "workound. Yeah. Thanks uh for that. Uh so Jes and Vijay um okay if you guys I have nothing to ask then uh one thing I this GitHub workflows thing GitHub action if we already have like a GitHub action which we have just use that link uh GitHub actions uh your can you what's the question specifically uh GA2 question let me see if it's in the list if it because it says right has a name that contains your email address. So it's going to be a GitHub action and the only thing it is going to have is",
  "action and the only thing it is going to have is if is that parameter is going to remain address only. Let me let me let me pull that [Music] up. Once we identify the question, we just uh basically whatever we already have the repo, we just send it back instead of creating anything. Right. More like a check of whether we did the question originally or not. What does the repository look like? Yeah. So, yeah. I mean, this I think this only checks um so let's see. Trigger the action. Make sure",
  "um so let's see. Trigger the action. Make sure it's the most recent action. [Music] Uh this yeah you just provide yeah you just create this action beforehand itself and uh provide the URL so we can check it out. So that's very straightforward actually. Uh so this question uh it's not parameterized right sir. So for a specific student, they get only their email ID. Yeah, this this one will Yeah, it'll be your own email ID for this cuz again like I said, it won't make any sense for us to look up",
  "I said, it won't make any sense for us to look up anyone else's. Okay. Also this uh these questions like uh the fifth question, sixth question here, right? It is going to have a JSON file which we download and then we repeat process, right? Yeah. So yeah, we will send you a JSON file for this. Yeah, I mean if it is if the file is parameterized. Okay. Is it parameterized or I'm not 100% sure. I think this one might be. Uh so this one each person might get a different file because it's a very",
  "might get a different file because it's a very small file 100 imaginary students. I suspect I highly suspect this is a request is going to be parameterized right sorry the request apart because it's in like bluish purple and like so no I mean not all files are going to be parameterized the best way to find out is check two different like find another student ask them can you share me you know what your JSON looks like and if there are differences in them then you know it's parameters usually",
  "in them then you know it's parameters usually small files like this will because um these are uh fake data sets, right? So I I suspect these have been uh randomly seeded and created on the fly in most cases. Okay. But uh the big file which is the there's a PDF file that won't be parameterized. That was u which brings me to another important question. Someone again asked this even though we addressed this issue um you know they say oh we cannot process a large file someone posted I think this",
  "process a large file someone posted I think this afternoon or morning I don't remember this exact same question saying oh we cannot process it etc etc or you cannot pre-process it but that's not true the reason being although the question we may ask you is different you can pre-process the file itself Right? Because the data in the file is the same. The file data in the file is not the question we ask you about the file may be different. That could be parameterized. Okay? So this uh in this",
  "could be parameterized. Okay? So this uh in this particular question the file will the data will be the same. This one this one I don't know this one might be parameterized I think. But I'm talking about there is one where there's like a huge I don't remember which G8 it is. I think it's G4 or something right? There's a huge 60 megabyte file or something like that. Yes, it was about a PDF. Yeah. So that we are not going to send you a 60. So that uh we will you know the best thing for that G is",
  "uh we will you know the best thing for that G is you uh pre-process the uh PDF file uh so that uh you convert it to something very small and efficient like a CSV or something and uh because the data hasn't changed at all just get the parameters of the question you know if it says find um I think it was about students right students from a certain group with a certain subject So you can just pre-process that, right? The only parameters that will change is which group and uh how many marks and",
  "change is which group and uh how many marks and all that sort of that's the only thing that will actually change. Nothing else will change in so you'll still have to do the calculation but do it on a pre-processed CSV file which is going to be like only maybe a megabyte or less. So size is not a problem. Yes. Okay. Anything else? Uh so so just to reiterate what you just said about that specific PDF question. Uh because the PDF is same for everyone and just the question is same. Uh I can convert",
  "and just the question is same. Uh I can convert that into a simpler uh format in my code itself and it just and the 60 megabyte file essentially is not going to be given as an input. So I Got it. Got it. Yeah. I don't remember which which particular G it was. I think it is five, right? Or four. So the PDF processing question. Yeah. Is it five? It was of a G4. This one right or tables maybe. Yes. Yes. There are four question lines. Yeah. So this I think is yeah this is a huge file I think if I",
  "I think is yeah this is a huge file I think if I remember correctly and um yeah so here this will be parameterized whether it's English whether it's 24 which groups but the data will not change this extract the uh okay the pages and everything can change the process you yeah yeah you'll have to somehow store this information right you'll have to decide the storage format It could. I'll give you an even better example. Instead of storing the file as a CSV, just store it as a data frame, right?",
  "as a CSV, just store it as a data frame, right? In memory. Yes, that is true. That also will work, right? And then you can process it exactly the way you want it because it'll be a in in memory table and then just just shoot out the answer that you require. It's a table, right? So yeah. Yeah. And if we if we have all the data, we already have all the data because we extracted. Yes. Just just have some data. Yeah. That that would be my approach if I was to simple simple way to fix that problem.",
  "I was to simple simple way to fix that problem. Uh yes, Pra. Yes. So in G5 question answer there is a question about transcription. So uh do we need to like uh install those libraries like ffm p in the VMs? Uh let me first let me look at the question because this I can't follow what the issues question. Okay. So here you have to process some audio file I and uh get the transcript right? Yes sir. between the download [Music] and what's the Okay, so this is the question, right? You have to",
  "Okay, so this is the question, right? You have to basically transcribe this. Yeah. So, what's the what's the problem, sir? Uh so uh when I tried it in the local machine so I had to install a lot of libraries for doing this transcription. So in the cloud environment uh so like libraries um you only need yes uh I mean you can use one of these right Gemini is free I think you can just use Gemini. Okay sir. Yeah, just use Gemini and uh run a run a subprocess with this command and it will be done,",
  "subprocess with this command and it will be done, right? Yes. And we won't send you a large audio file. It'll be a very tiny audio file. So So the link the YouTube link would be parameterized or uh it would be same for all. This one the audio file will be uh it it will be same for all. Almost 100% sure. No, not almost. I'm 100% sure we'll give everyone the same audio file which will be a very small file. Excellent. You just have to return the text. Correct. It's just the text of the transcript.",
  "Correct. It's just the text of the transcript. That's all. No, no need to process it. Yeah. I mean there is no need to process it. We will send you a tiny file. Yeah. I what the file is may be different from this but u it'll be a very tiny file and it'll be the same answer the question just because I said that it won't change sorry what was that I really like because you are saying that this uh file won't change right if if this file is not changing it's a simple thing just get the text and and",
  "it's a simple thing just get the text and and give the return uh I mean process yeah see you will have to process it yeah Okay, it's not not that you can't don't have to process it, but his concern I think was uh he had to get a lot of libraries. My point is you don't need any libraries, right? You just send an API call with this token and it will get it right. Yes, it'll barely take any time because it'll be a very tiny file first of all. So yeah, no no issues with this also. very easy to do",
  "no no issues with this also. very easy to do this question. Just give me one second. Okay. Right. Um what um so we can I can still keep taking questions. Uh they'll be ready in about five minutes or so. What the deployment environment is hostal enough or like should we really just look into the whole hosting? Just use whatever you're comfortable with. Uh there's no hard and fast rule. No, at the end of the day what we see the goal for project 2 was we want students to be very comfortable",
  "2 was we want students to be very comfortable working with APIs cuz that's what this is right it's an exercise in beating you to death with APIs effectively you have we you have to respond to an API uh you have to give a response uh that uh uh has an endpoint then we will trigger another API so it's just why because this is the world of data right data interchange occurs over APIs. Unless you're very comfortable with this, you will really struggle out there in the real life. So, Anand's goal is",
  "out there in the real life. So, Anand's goal is to make sure that students walk away from this course being extremely comfortable with APIs because even if you think about the agentic work, right? Forget LLMs, even that is being done through an API, right? So if you're very comfortable with API, you'll be able to have different systems interact with each other. That's the goal, right? If you can get different systems to communicate with each other via an API, then you have achieved something",
  "via an API, then you have achieved something very valuable. Uh you will be able to build complex systems. Mhm. Um so that's why uh this is a very important learning tool uh with regards to uh dealing with data and how it flows from one system to another and of course each system might do a certain transformation and then um then that output from that system might go through another system but again an API will be involved. So so that's the go that's the goal for uh project. So I hope you're",
  "that's the goal for uh project. So I hope you're getting good exercise in this process also collaboration sorry also the collaboration thing which you said yeah yeah that's also the other thing he wanted that's why he gave you said 5G is right nearly 60 questions because uh then you're forced to work with one another right people are have proper groups proper assignment you do this question you do this question you do that and that is the only way it is making sense otherwise whatever that.",
  "way it is making sense otherwise whatever that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, great. Uh we, you know, we're already thinking about next term. So, what how we can create a a truly um large project where everyone contributes um does commits uh and are part of a project, you know. So we're bashing up some ideas together to do something for nextto which will encourage this sort of collaborative work where everyone contributes something and there is visibility of your work to everyone. So everyone knows",
  "of your work to everyone. So everyone knows okay this person is responsible for this component that person the person with the most commits to the common repo gets an internship at yeah maybe okay why not we can uh you can always ask an for sure so yeah uh any other questions uh are there any more uh questions where uh just like similar to this PDF question uh where the file will not be provided as an input but it has to be present in the code uh will there will the similar format be followed",
  "uh will there will the similar format be followed for any other uh question you have to find that for yourself right I'm not going going to tell you exactly every single one right uh that means I'll have to go through all the 58 questions for you that's your job right got it sir but uh I think uh for that PDF question. Uh a friend of mine had like different set of values. Yeah. Yeah. The values will be different because his question is different but the file is the same. Right. Yeah. So finding",
  "but the file is the same. Right. Yeah. So finding out whether files are different or the same that you can do with your friends. Both of you sit and look through all the files and see which ones are different. then you know okay these ones they will definitely send and it's always going to be very tiny files if they are different and the ones that don't change they are not going to uh send you different files so that's how it would work let me just check something you're able to see my G5",
  "me just check something you're able to see my G5 screen at the moment right yes sir and only that correct okay that's good uh because I want to pull something up here that might be useful to discuss. So, okay. [Music] Okay, that's fine. Uh, right. Okay. So, the other other questions or I can move on to something that uh so I can move on to basically talk discussing about end term while we waiting on the TS. Check the comment. Sorry, check the comments. Is it wonder if someone builds this",
  "the comments. Is it wonder if someone builds this project with 100% accuracy then for next term this J one to five would be redundant. So Praep I have some very bad news for you. Uh TDS every term produces new questions. So, so if you look at last term's questions, I I literally my computer crashed, my RO went to Okay. So, we'll probably be repeating TDS. Right. Right. So, you'll get a whole set of new questions. It'll keep everything fresh and interesting, you know, so it won't become boring.",
  "interesting, you know, so it won't become boring. I needed the break to be honest. Lot of pleasure. Mhm. Okay. Right. So if there's no other questions for the moment, uh so some um what I'll do is I'll go over. Okay. So for um end term we will all seven modules will be there. Okay. Uh as far as the syllabus is concerned anything that you've learned along the way from like project one and project two which again they already covered things that we have already taught. So there shouldn't be any",
  "we have already taught. So there shouldn't be any surprises there. Um so if we go with uh start here um okay so things about the um brow you know things like VS code and all um we are unlikely to ask you questions about that. Okay. uh when it comes to perhaps asking you about uh what tool you would use to for example um run some packages with uh dependencies and things of that sort then you have to be at least familiar that that's what u does the kind of thing that might be asked right [Music]",
  "kind of thing that might be asked right [Music] um npx you know you should be aware that it's a a library for Java JavaScript um sorry not library it's um what's the word I'm looking for it's a um it's a package manager that's the word right it's a package manager for JavaScript similar like how UV is for Python right so um these technical words matter in an exam so just be aware of that so what a package manager does is you know you can get some uh import some libraries that do certain things",
  "uh import some libraries that do certain things uh and then run it um so that you can uh produce certain outputs. So that's what package managers do, right? So if you think about in the Python context because that's what you're most familiar with, you know, you will for example get pandas and then you will run it in your code and that's uh a package manager like pip will or in our case UV which we prefer uh will be what you would use. uh uni-ode encodings, things to be aware of, you know, how",
  "encodings, things to be aware of, you know, how these encodings work. Uh any uh particular nuggets of information that you find in this video will be uh is quite possibly helpful in an enter. So my advice watch the video understand what encodings are about. Then uh with browser tools um they might ask you uh questions pertaining to browser tools. Okay, because it's a fairly important topic. So what they might ask you is like they so be familiar with the the whole um what do you call it? inspect",
  "the the whole um what do you call it? inspect uh part of it uh where you go to for example uh find cookies and uh what's the network tab used for these kinds of questions can be asked uh we won't ask you obscure things like lighthouse and recorder and all won't be asked but the things that we covered in TDS throughout our sessions right the elements console sources uh network performance is mostly to do with u how your page loads and things of that sort, but the application be familiar with",
  "that sort, but the application be familiar with what these tabs are and how they work. You will you will almost certainly get questions uh in the end term about it. Uh CSS selectors. Yes, this is u a useful topic uh to know about. Uh there have been questions in the past uh dealing with CSS selectors. So, be familiar with this. uh one of the best places to learn it has always been this particular site right basic CSS selectors and I always tell students that um learn everything till at least",
  "students that um learn everything till at least till combinators from basic to combinators beyond that we are very unlikely to ask you because that has more to do with u styling and things right we are more interested in CSS from a a data extraction point of view. So anything to do with data extraction, those are the things we will typically ask you in an end. So these four um would be the most useful. Someone was saying something just just confirming this. Yeah. Um so that's typically what",
  "this. Yeah. Um so that's typically what would be asked as far as CSS is concerned. JSON again be familiar with the usual functions loads dumps what they do you know when is it appropriate to use them that sort of thing um what's the structure of a JSON that's useful in an intern almost certainly there there's a high likelihood of a question being asked because it's very important uh J as you obviously know by now he I think you guys if someone uh uh wakes you up in the middle of the night and",
  "uh uh wakes you up in the middle of the night and asks you about JSON, you probably will be able to tell everything about JSON, right? So, JavaScript object notation. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, um bash uh there can be some questions but they will not be very heavy questions in bash. So uh anything that um we have typically used in the gas those are possible candidates for things to be asked um we are not going to expect you to be an expert at bash that's not going to be realistic but simple commands",
  "not going to be realistic but simple commands and things of that sort we may ask okay um again the scope of that might be similar to what you've seen in GS so nothing too heavy uh spreadsheets. Um I can't think of any scenario where there may be anything significant asked in spreadsheets uh like Gsheets. Um there may be a simple formula that might be asked something that might have been in a GA for example. So, but I would not worry too much in depth about Google Sheets and Excel unless there",
  "depth about Google Sheets and Excel unless there were things that um were specifically asked in a GA. Okay, SQL um you might get some basic questions about SQL. The best place to practice this uh has u been I think I've shared it at the beginning of the term something called SQL zoo. Uh you guys are familiar with that SQL Zoo it's not it's a good it's a very good site. Okay. It has practice examples so you can try it out yourself. U it takes you step by step. you can see the results. So, learn",
  "step by step. you can see the results. So, learn the basics. Okay. Again, not expert. They're not expecting you to be an expert. There might there is some possibility of an SQL question, but uh not too heavy. English English like SQL. Yeah. Yeah. Simple things are possible. Uh git um is important. and understand some of the commands that are specifically like mentioned here. For example, these are all valuable commands, right? Get in it. Obviously, you should know how to clone, um how to",
  "you should know how to clone, um how to connect to a remote, uh server, uh how to add, how to [Music] push. So, those sorts of things are useful checking the differences between commits. Uh be reasonably familiar with these sorts of things. Okay, but beyond this we will not ask uh it's valuable to know at least these main things. That brings us to deployment tools module two. Um markdown there's unlikely to be any significant question on markdown specifically. Okay. Um so for the next iteration",
  "specifically. Okay. Um so for the next iteration of TDS can we have AWS and proper hosting and deploying application kind of stuff? It's uh we are we are it's constantly in flux right. So it might uh we haven't yet uh decided what's in the next term. We're still working on that. um um image [Music] compression. We may ask you about image formats and things of that sort but uh I don't think there will be any library related questions uh with regards to image compression. Okay. Uh that's not",
  "regards to image compression. Okay. Uh that's not likely to be there. Um so in other words, you know, a question. So going just going back real quickly. So an example of a question is, you know, um what would be a lossless um um format, right? You should be able to tell, okay, PNG, WEBP, they are lossless compression type formats. So things like that, a vector format might be SVG. These kind of simplistic questions might be asked because they're worth knowing, right? Uh because uh image sizes",
  "worth knowing, right? Uh because uh image sizes and things of that sort matter a lot when you're transferring data across the web. Is there a Python or some some tool which can upscale images like uh upscaling? I have personally not done much upscaling. Uh the only upscaling I tried was some time ago and it was uh I used an AI tool to do that. Um okay because nowadays almost all upscaling tools uh use some leverage some uh AI tool to upscale right so that the quality of the upscale is very good",
  "so that the quality of the upscale is very good okay yeah but u uh I've not personally I've not engaged in a lot of it so the answer I don't know it's a problem we can you can ask uh Anand he may be more aware of that he's quite into images and things these days. So next term there will be a lot of uh content around uh AI and image modeling and uh transformations using AI I think. So that's like I'm using paid tools for image generation but yeah and scaling. Yeah. So he was very excited about",
  "and scaling. Yeah. So he was very excited about those things. We were supposed to have some of the content this time but there was not enough time to actually put it on there. So it'll be there for next time. Uh so yeah static hosting uh you should know what you can use for static hosting. So GitHub pages obviously understand the difference between static hosting and uh something like serverless hosting and all those things uh would be good to know. Uh okay u second. Okay. Then collab. Uh",
  "to know. Uh okay u second. Okay. Then collab. Uh there's not nothing specifically will be asked about collab. It's just a tool that you use like an editor basically. [Music] Uh so okay. Yeah. Versel to run serverless um functions. So we won't ask um uh any complicated question here you know just understand what server versel is for. So in other words it's uh instead of having an entire VM which takes a lot of resources right it's just all it does is it when you hit an endpoint it just runs that",
  "is it when you hit an endpoint it just runs that function so it pretends to be a server but it's not right. So this write up is quite good about it. So that kind of question we might ask right what is vers used for and then there may be some options and you have to choose the most appropriate option. So it'll be a very simplistic question but being familiar with what it is and what it's not is something that's valid. GitHub actions um again with GitHub actions they won't ask you how to code it.",
  "GitHub actions they won't ask you how to code it. uh the most likely questions they would ask you would be around what it's used for, what's when is it appropriate. So they may give you a scenario and they may ask okay which of these tools might be most useful to use GitHub actions for right. So you should be familiar with uh that why you use GitHub action. Can someone actually tell me why you use GitHub actions to repetit stuff and to like maybe for example if you're deploying something maybe",
  "for example if you're deploying something maybe they can check it for errors and before before launching stuff. Yeah. To basically do some automated actions, right? Almost like a Chrome job but for git. So in fact it's running a Chrome job here. So one example I can give you is uh when doing uh projects right one of the things uh uh I have a GitHub action is before it commits I want the version number to change automatically of my project. So a version number will usually have a major revision",
  "version number will usually have a major revision minor revision build revision and a patch revision right. So if there are small if there are small changes to my project I'll change only the patch version. It's slightly bigger changes then they will it will change the uh revision version uh the uh build sorry the um yeah the revision version and if it is entire files that are being added then it'll change the build version like that. So to do automated actions is what you use GitHub actions",
  "automated actions is what you use GitHub actions for and then they so a question might be they might give you some scenario and then they might ask you or uh they will tell okay choose the most appropriate tool to do this that you have to be familiar but they won't ask you how to do it right so they won't ask you any syntax related things. So how do you decide if something is like a major number of comments or something? Ah yeah. So what yeah so there are different ways to do it. You can have",
  "there are different ways to do it. You can have various hooks in there that uh looks at uh the number of changes you have done. Uh so it automates that for you. So that's what I do. I have a pre-commit hook that it looks at and uh in there there's some logic I put that allows it to decide whether it's a major minor uh or what it is. Okay. Then uh podman and docker they're uh here you'll have to be at least familiar with some basic commands of it. Okay. Uh nothing too heavy just uh the basics",
  "it. Okay. Uh nothing too heavy just uh the basics and what they what their use cases tunneling enro again what is enrock used for that's something that could be asked. uh I don't think there will be any um syntax related question with enrock but uh it will be mainly like I said to identify what enlock is for course uh is to do with cross origins resource sharing. So can someone tell me why we use course? or just something like for example there is a site open in my browser right I do not want",
  "is a site open in my browser right I do not want it to access resources of another site right so that origin has to be like maybe the client's browser but not some random server also yeah correct yeah yeah so that's what yeah so that's what it is right but sometimes in some scenarios right you want to allow access for certain things Right? So you can control that using codes. So if you say allow origin star, right? That means from anywhere the uh request can come, right? Whereas you can uh",
  "uh request can come, right? Whereas you can uh control it more specifically. You can say okay I wanted only um uh requests that come from this particular domain. Those only I will respond to. Right? So uh course is basically to control uh which end points to respond. Maybe the word middleware is reminding me what was some critical level vulnerability in nextJS. Do they they have this middleware being bypassed altogether? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course people will look to exploit these things. Um",
  "people will look to exploit these things. Um usually with JavaScript. All right. I've been told that uh the GA the TAs are ready. So they'll take over from now and uh then we can continue um with regards to endm prep uh in the upcoming sessions. Okay. All right guys, is my screen visible? All right. So, uh let's get started. So uh what I have done over here is that I have created the project uh using fast API and uh then uh containerized it using docker and then published it to azure uh created",
  "docker and then published it to azure uh created a virtual machine over there and then I'm running it on my server. So let me just show you a basic demonstration of this uh code uh of this uh deployment. So here is the uh okay so here is the deployed uh URL present over here. Now uh this is the uh main page. This is the uh slash endpoint. Now let's access let's try to access the uh let's try to make this file run some tasks. Right. So here we have it and this is our endpoint using the API",
  "we have it and this is our endpoint using the API endpoint. So first of all let's just check it if it's giving us the right right uh uh results or not. So for that dot uh get let's check file and let's check the JSON respon let's hope it's right. Yeah. So we are able to uh we able to get the JSON response correctly. Now let's try and running few uh not few actually uh just one task over it. So this is the API point and uh let's try running this particular task. It says that download and process",
  "task. It says that download and process the files that uni code question from uh GA1. I guess it was GA1 uh question 18 if I'm not just have a look at it. Uh yeah it's G1 question number uh 12. So let's try and run this. Let's hope and see it's fine. We have received something generate anything and fine we have got a response and let's just check it. Yeah. So we are getting the desired response. So uh now I will try now I will uh just get into the depths of what we have done and uh how we have",
  "depths of what we have done and uh how we have done it. Right. So first of all uh this is my project. Uh let me magnify it a bit. Uh fine. So this is the project. Uh this over here I have uh this is the main file which is running all the operations. So this is the file where I have the fast API code. Uh as you can see I have enabled cards as well and uh these uh over from this file I have all these endpoints enabled right. So this is the endpoint of uh yeah here it is. So here is my endpoint",
  "of uh yeah here it is. So here is my endpoint and as you can see that uh when I'm hitting / API endpoint what I am expecting the user to send me I'm expecting them to send this uh I'm expecting them to send a body a post request I'm expecting them to send a post request which contains a body which have two form elements first is the uh question element and next one is the file element right now So one thing that uh I want to demonstrate in front of you is that how you can actually read and",
  "of you is that how you can actually read and access the files without even downloading them. Right? So without without even downloading any file from uh let's just say if you got uh so this is a tester let me just show you the tester. Yeah. So this is a tester file where I'm actually sending the requests which uh we will be sending to you. Fine. So we will be sending you uh so we'll be sending the request in this kind of format where we are giving you the questions and then the files as well.",
  "you the questions and then the files as well. So the file as you can see that we'll be send we'll be opening the file and we will be uh kind of broadcasting the bites of that file file so after uh so we will be giving you uh we will be giving these two uh uh form elements to you. And now as you can see that I have opened this file over here. Fine. And I'm reading and I'm uh reading the bytes and I'm just sending it fine. But this is from our end from the end of the TDS uh packing team. But when",
  "from the end of the TDS uh packing team. But when it comes to you when it comes to you and uh uh in your application there is no need to actually download the file which we are sending it to, right? There is no need for that. What you can do instead is that uh yeah here it is. So this is the functions uh file where I have all my functions stored. So as you can see what I'm exactly doing is I have a function for uh yeah I have a function called zip extraction and another one for JSON one. So",
  "zip extraction and another one for JSON one. So what I'm exactly doing is I am reading these bytes, these incoming byes directly from the API request rather than downloading the file itself. So what this will help you with is that you won't have to download anything in your docker container. There won't be any need of that. You just have to read them as bytes. As you can see that uh this IO library this is an inbuilt library of Python uh should I say the default library of Python and you can",
  "I say the default library of Python and you can use this library and this bytes IO function to read these these incoming bytes right uh after that uh I was uh okay so over here uh we are uh sending the we are receiving these files as bytes fine Next what I'm doing is I am creating so I have created some embeddings. So these embeddings have been created using the uh open API open AI embeddings as you can see that this was uh taught to us uh this was taught to you uh in week three and uh uh using",
  "taught to you uh in week three and uh uh using these embeddings we are actually we are actually computing the similarity of the question that you have received in the API endpoint and the question bank you have already present with you. Fine. So we are generating the matches. So this particular function get matched. As you can see this is the function. It uh generates these embeddings and then compares it using coile severity and gets the highest value the uh the highest contender uh of uh",
  "value the uh the highest contender uh of uh these questions where uh with which the asked question belongs to. So if that was uh hard to understand just annotate it. So this is the question that we are going to ask you guys use. Okay. This is the question that we're going to ask you and you have an entire question bank ready with you. Right? So we have 58 questions and you have an entire question bank ready with you. Now in this question so this particular question which we have asked to you",
  "particular question which we have asked to you you will be running uh you'll be running coign similarities using embeddings from this question bank and you will get the question out of this question bank which has the most similarity with this particular portion this particular portion. So even if we parameterize if you even if we send different parameters in that question you will be able to the embeddings will be able to find the similarity in the text of that question. That's why uh using",
  "in the text of that question. That's why uh using embeddings would would be much more beneficial for you. Fine. So this is done and we are getting the question which has the most similarity with the ask question. And then uh here we have the match and then we are running this function. So this is uh so I have all my functions as I told you that I have all my functions in this functions file uh functions.pf file. So I'm importing all these functions from in index.py and then I'm using them using",
  "from in index.py and then I'm using them using this globals. So this globals is a entire dictionary which you can uh so this globals contains all the all the uh all the global all the global variables just clear this one out. So this global uh uh dictionary it contains all the uh all the globally available variables and you can use so uh uh you will call the function and then this will go to the functions part and it's just the rest of the part is just simple finding out the solution for that.",
  "is just simple finding out the solution for that. Fine. So this is done and uh uh we just have to after creating everything just create a docker file. Fine. create a docker file and create some container ignores as well because you won't want unwanted stuff to get passed into your uh docker container right uh also create a requirements txt keep it precise and use only the libraries which actually you're going to use in your code fine so because I have u I have worked upon only a few questions",
  "I have u I have worked upon only a few questions that's why I have this I have a few number of libraries working over but you guys are going have uh perhaps a lot of uh libraries in disgo right? So after that simply uh create a docker container with that and uh use docker uh sorry use podman build and it will be created. After that uh head back to Azure uh so if you guys are not a uh if you guys are not aware uh Azure provides $100 worth of credits to IIT Madras students. So basically uh it",
  "to IIT Madras students. So basically uh it provides $100 worth of credits to all uh students who have access to a student uh email ID. So you can use your IIT Madras ID to avail this uh resource. So uh when this is done so this is I have created multiple. So when I was actually testing with what I can use to deploy my application uh I created all these different kinds of so what worked finally was a virtual machine. So you simply have to go over here click on a virtual machine. So this is a",
  "here click on a virtual machine. So this is a virtual machine you have to click on create as your virtual virtual machine and over here now you have to mention uh so this is just a basic uh which group does this particular virtual machine belongs to that you can either use an existing one or you can create a Fine. Uh okay. Next you have to give the name of the virtual machine. Any name that you might uh want. Then select the region. I would suggest you to use uh a region which is near to India.",
  "you to use uh a region which is near to India. Uh or near to the location where you are currently uh living. So that would be much better. And uh so over here go for central India. Right. And uh that is good. Next, you have to select which kind of uh OS you're going to use. That's done. And uh next, using a password. So, using a password would be much more uh better than using an SSH public key. Uh that's my experience. If you guys uh feel it comfortable to use an SSH public key, then that's up",
  "to use an SSH public key, then that's up to you. Fine. Uh next comes uh okay. So, allow secreted ports. Uh this is done. Just click on review and create. will take it sweet time. Okay. Few validations have okay over here. This is good. Let's uh create uh a TDS there [Music] file India and availability zone. This is good. Uh good good. It's asking for us who usern uh for username you can enter any username I suppose. Uh let's enter EDS and uh the password can be anything that you want. So uh by",
  "password can be anything that you want. So uh by the way you have to follow these instructions which are which have been given to you while while creating a password. So let me create uh what can Okay, let's go for this. Okay. It's not magic. Done. And you are create. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh there you can enter your uh phone number as well. Is it optional? I guess it's optional. Next comes create. And let's wait for it. So it has initialized a deployment for our resource. and go to resource.",
  "deployment for our resource. and go to resource. Fine. So here we have it. Okay. Here we have it. This is a public uh IP address. You can use this to access this resource. Okay. This is not machine button. So in the next you will have to Okay. one. Next, you actually have to uh run uh you have to use Azure CLI for uh setting up your uh for setting up your resource uh using which you can actually send your Docker image or podman image to Azure and then it will be able to access it. Okay. Okay.",
  "then it will be able to access it. Okay. Okay. So after uh typing this as uh space login. So it's going to give you this uh login ID. So you just have to sign in from this and you'll be able to continue. Yeah. Login successful. That's good. And now yeah so we have got it the it's asking for a number I guess I will do enter fine so this is Done. Look up. This is register. [Music] Next uh you will have to link this uh Azure login as was successful. Next we have to uh actually send the docker",
  "Next we have to uh actually send the docker image as [Music] you have uploaded the docker image. So on talker hub [Music] and to be honest uh so let me just show you. So this was what uh I was trying for a lot of time and after a lot of debugging and uh lot of after running a lot of commands and whatever uh we were able to successfully get into it. So uh I will recommend you guys to do this part yourself because to be honest it was uh it was difficult for me as well. I just kept so I just asked",
  "for me as well. I just kept so I just asked GPT how to uh just connect Ashure with my Potman uh container. So so login was uh one of the sub one of the steps. Next uh it asks me to do a lot of other stuffs but uh yeah so here it is. So it will ask you to actually uh set a subscription ID as well. Uh get the Okay. Okay. So here it is. So you have to run this particular command and uh so over here you can see that yeah you have to present the resource group. So the resource group which we",
  "resource group. So the resource group which we actually selected while we were creating the PM and then the BM name and uh [Music] okay so running these commands. So there are multiple commands to be honest and uh you should use chat GPT for this. just ask it what all commands should I run and how should I you know connect Azure and uh uh my pod man or docker container so that's one thing which you can do and uh it was a long process so I will recommend you guys to do it uh on your own by the",
  "recommend you guys to do it uh on your own by the way uh guys any other questions so uh instead of directly deploying the code we should containerize it and then oh yeah yeah so containerizing is the best possible uh way you can actually uh deploy your application with. So uh yeah that's the best way and moreover uh using containers it would be much more beneficial uh for you. Uh-huh. So uh just because they are because the size is a lot right? the size is a lot and moreover let us say if uh",
  "the size is a lot and moreover let us say if uh you have to run a Linux uh command you have to run some subprocesses so these containers are a kind of environment of their own they have their own OS they have their uh so they have everything inside them so when you have to run these some kind of subprocesses it would be much more beneficial while you are using containers because then they then you will be actually be able to use it what I did was in the Last session I tried to use GitHub to",
  "was in the Last session I tried to use GitHub to actually deploy it on Azure and it failed miser miserably to be honest and uh uh that didn't went that didn't went as intended. So using containers that would be much more beneficial. Uh the second point can be that uh Azure uh so it actually provides you multiple resources when you're using containers to deploy your application. So uh you can use the entire CLI to uh manage your containers and then actually deploy it. So that's those are some uh",
  "actually deploy it. So that's those are some uh some advantages of using containers. Does that answer your question? Uh yes. So any other questions? Guys, any other questions uh regarding any question you might have? Any uh kind of sess that you might uh want to uh might want me to uh demonstrate from this code? Yeah. Yeah. Uh so I wanted to can you go back to the actual code file that you were showing earlier where you enable and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh so I think somewhere here I saw that the",
  "Yeah. Uh so I think somewhere here I saw that the output response is like uh the JSON format open curly braces within quotes answer and then uh you have your semicolon and then the answer the answer is uh like in the project to uh website. So the answer was also like the answer part was also within quotes but however here it's not like that format. the answer part was also in quotes perhaps that might be the case. Uh let's have a look at it. Okay. So we have to put the So this is what you're",
  "So we have to put the So this is what you're talking about, right? Yeah, our answer should be in uh quotes. So let's check if we are getting that or not. Okay. So that's not what we are getting. So uh okay that's pretty easy to uh rectify and thanks uh uh Shalini was it? Yeah. So thanks Shani for pointing it out fine. So so this is done and uh you can actually change it. You can uh you have to give the responses in a string. Fine. Any other questions guys? Will this work for JSON object also?",
  "guys? Will this work for JSON object also? Yeah, this can work for JSON object. Uh the string uh function might not work for JSON objects. For that you should use JSON dumps if I'm not wrong. JSON dumps. Yeah. And can you like demonstrate uh just for one of the questions that has Jason? So for example, uh G4 um just a second. Yeah. For GAFO question 4, can you just uh kind of uh work on that question? Yeah, that's like a proper JSON response to that question. Just a sec. Yeah. So, you're",
  "to that question. Just a sec. Yeah. So, you're expecting me to show you how you have to send your JSON response, right? Correct. Yeah. Fine. So, let me run my server locally. Yeah, it's running. And uh Okay. Okay. My server is running and uh we're sending this API file. What I will do is instead of sending this response as an uh so this is the name of this. So instead of sending it like this, I will instead just for the sake of explanation, I will open a JSON file and send the response or we",
  "will open a JSON file and send the response or we can do one thing. We can create a different function for that. Yeah, here it is. Uh okay, I'm not using this one. Uh let's yeah G4 question four just as you suggested. So here this would be uh because we have to get the JSON data JSON loads. Instead of doing that what I will do is I will just simply open a JSON file. Uh yeah there it is. [Music] Copy. Uh done. Okay. Not question mapper. This should be data. JSON.loads. Next we'll be returning",
  "be data. JSON.loads. Next we'll be returning the data. Returning the data. And uh what I will do is I will head back to my answers over here. As you can see that uh we don't have any question which is mapped to this particular function here right so as you can see that uh uh let me open this one as well the question mark. Yeah. So these are these were the uh three questions which I had. Uh okay. We have one uh question which is mapped to G4 portion 4. Fine. That's perfect. So we have this",
  "portion 4. Fine. That's perfect. So we have this particular function and uh next we have the question mapped over here as well. So what we have to do is we'll be sending this question and uh we won't send any other uh question file as well. Finally can deal with that. This is done and uh the only part which is remaining is to use the tester. It's listening on one XML data. Yeah, here it is. And uh this is good. I have to copy it from here. Let me just copy this much. And I'm pretty confident it",
  "just copy this much. And I'm pretty confident it will be able to identify which portion we're talking about. We'll send this and uh uh Okay. Okay, this is good. Let's run it. Fine. Let's check it. 500 response. Let's have a look at it and okay. Check it. It's sending the question. We're sending the file byes as well. Uh, okay. So, well, file. It's reading the file. Okay. file types. It's run pretty well for this one. Okay, I guess this is the problem. Starting not to send the STR response.",
  "problem. Starting not to send the STR response. Let's check it once again. Uh instead, let's do one thing. Let's head back to our question once again. Let's check if it's running or not. Yeah, it's running. What we can do is in our functions, let's open this particular file and send the data. File. Let's do it once again. Okay, let's check it. Uh, okay. There might be some cash once again. Ah, yeah. Now it should give me the right answer. Okay. What's the issue? [Music] Is it still [Music]",
  "What's the issue? [Music] Is it still [Music] listening? Okay. All right. [Music] Uh sorry 1808 80 still not able to keep the spawn [Music] Or else what we can do is instead of running it on port man we can simply run a basic application and let's close this and run my basic UVR comment icon. Fine. Ah, okay. It's working. Uh, let's send this somehow. So, answer. Uh, is it printing details? Uh, okay. I can do that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, we got something method not allowed. Uh, okay. Post request",
  "method not allowed. Uh, okay. Post request now. Yeah. Oops. This [Music] Okay, it is working. Yeah, it's a post. All right. On the file as well. Uh, okay. Where the f I have the file. I Ah, okay. I found what's the error. So, actually I have to set up a environment uh variable for my API key. That's what I missed. All right. So now let's give it a try. Okay. Hope it works. Oh, on the VM uh like in the container do you define all the environment variables or can you give it some errors? Yeah, I",
  "variables or can you give it some errors? Yeah, I did uh provide the variables as well. So when you are running the podman container or the docker container uh you can specify the uh the environment variable there itself. Okay. Uh, you build one thing and the other thing breaks. Let's have a look at it. I will create embeddings. Let's convert it over. Let's imported. Let's try once again. There is some problem with the embeddings part. which was working pretty fine until [Music] now. JSON.",
  "was working pretty fine until [Music] now. JSON. Okay. The user JSON over here. Okay. name 500 is not I okay it's in this particular file is this It's printing TDN. [Music] [Music] Okay, let's do one thing. I will instead of implementing it in code because there is some kind of error I'm not sure about. Let me just show you how you will be using it, how you will be sending the response. Fine. Uh first of all, uh let's import where is it? Fine. We have our data, right? So let's say this is the",
  "We have our data, right? So let's say this is the response which my function has generated. Fine. Now what I can do is I can use JSON dumps and this will be converted to a string. Fine. This will be converted to a string. Next uh what we have to do is simply answer should like this and run it. So this is what we are expecting you to do. You have to whatever you have just simply use JSON dumps to convert your entire JSON object to a string. Let me check uh if I'm uh right this JSON dump should",
  "me check uh if I'm uh right this JSON dump should be a string. Yeah, it's a string. Okay, so you have to use whenever you have JSON object, I always use JSON dumps to convert it into a string. You can use I guess stringify as well. uh just give it a try. If dumps doesn't work, well, it should work. Uh but uh for whatever reason, if it doesn't work, then you string define as uh does that answer your questions already? Yeah. Uh I'm I'm sorry to be a little specific, but uh the answer here um the",
  "a little specific, but uh the answer here um the answer as well as the answer part both are enclosed within single quotes. Uh that is not a problem, right? Uh that's not that's not a problem. So on our end we will be creating an evaluation script where uh these things won't matter you if it's a string if this is a so we just have to get this particular JSON object where you have an answer as a key and the rest of the response as a string that's the only thing that we want give it uh just like",
  "the only thing that we want give it uh just like that and we'll be able to evaluate it. Got it. And uh just another uh follow-up question. Can you just explain or at least show how JSON loads can be used? I think Carlton spoke about it yesterday that it would be used for evaluation in case if you get escape line characters or uh Yeah. Yeah. characters. Okay. Okay. Got it. Just a second. Because I tried doing it, I was not quite successful. So I thought uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if I am not wrong",
  "thought uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if I am not wrong uh someone posted on this course that uh they were facing some so they posted about this particular okay it's a GS yeah so they posted about uh uh them receiving those backslashes. Uh so yeah there it is. So this was their response. Let me just copy this entire object. Fine. So, uh this was their response and you can see that we have multiple backslashes and whatnot over here, right? Yeah. Now, simply using a JSON loads should convert it into a",
  "using a JSON loads should convert it into a JSON object. And it has converted to a JSON object. Okay. Yeah. Perhaps you you must be using uh JSON.load. There is uh another method which is JSON.load which is not uh which I guess it has been depreciated or what but it doesn't work. So you have to load use a loads and for uh so this is one function and for converting into a string you have to use dumps. So there is also another method called dump. So dump won't work. You have to use dumps. I guess",
  "dump won't work. You have to use dumps. I guess both of these have been depreciated for whatever reason. Oh yeah. Yeah. Tell uh ask question. Yeah. Yeah. So Python code or markdown type of questions we will have escape character just slash and write. So how will you be taking that and converting? Yeah, in markdown and uh in Python code you just have to so if you have created an entire code over there you just have to convert it into a string and for that string I have used but it's not being",
  "for that string I have used but it's not being converted correctly while uh what is not being converted correctly please elaborate on that yeah so for example we have something like Python code and we are using fring and just printing it's printing directly ly in our console but actually when we get the response it should be converted as a like string right str of value at the point of time it's uh not properly like it's giving the escape characters like slash and yeah escape characters are",
  "like slash and yeah escape characters are fine because you would be yeah because when you will be converting a particular chunk of code Pythonic code into string you will get escape characters. That's pretty normal. Uh even in markdown you will be getting these escape characters. So that's expected and uh we will be creating the evaluation script keeping in mind that these escape characters will be there and uh converting them into their original format will be our task. Okay. Okay. Okay. Fine.",
  "format will be our task. Okay. Okay. Okay. Fine. And one more thing in GA4 there is last question is there regarding markdown uh PDF to mark down conversion there is a question called question is last question of KFO Right. Yeah. So this question we were not able to solve when we add in key. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I used um like PDF MLU and had some output but it's not matching. So will this have some latency in validations like evaluation? What what I can say is that uh we very well know",
  "What what I can say is that uh we very well know that this was not possible using the library which we instructed you to use and we it required some manual intervention right? Yeah. So we are aware of that and I will and I can say that some kind of clean what what they are asking in this question. Yeah. So here we I have used the second package 4 lm llm package and converted the entire output to markdown. So but text is not capturing like table structure and all. So it's not properly aligned.",
  "structure and all. So it's not properly aligned. That's what my question was. So how will dev addation be? What I can say is that you must have generated a specific response for this part, right? Yeah. Must have the particular answer for this. Yeah. So what you can do is simply respond with that. Okay. Yeah. Fine. That's wrong. If it's wrong or right, that's fine. just response is needed. Uh wrong or right means what's what uh because we uh there are few like error message I am getting missing",
  "are few like error message I am getting missing table those and all are getting the error messages when I raise my output. Mhm. So that those things I can ignore right because manual inter no you don't have to ignore what I suggest you must have the exact answer for this question right? Yeah, where it's passing every test case and it's giving you a bright green correct over here. I have the answer for this question but PDF will be changing right uh the possibility is low okay that happen so",
  "uh the possibility is low okay that happen so that's all I can say the possibility is low okay so if I would have been at your place instead of responding with a PDF instead of responding with a marone file which uh contains a lot of errors because you'll be using this uh particular library. I would have responded with the exact correct response. I have that one in backup. I can Yeah. So that you can do and uh the possibility is low of this particular PDF changing. So you can play the gamble",
  "PDF changing. So you can play the gamble gamble there. Okay. Okay. And on audio files how we should be figuring out I am not able to do. I did not figure it out while doing GFI also audio file transcription how to do that uh G5 it's question number I think nine question number nine transcribing a YouTube video yeah yeah for that uh I guess we have multiple other libraries. So if I'm not wrong, we have a DL YT library kind of uh that's the name of that particular library and you can simply run",
  "of that particular library and you can simply run it in PowerShell. It will give you the correct transcriptions. In fact, uh what you can do is you can extract the audio out of it. the and that's also that's also possible using a single line uh a single line command extract the audio use a different uh use a publicly available API for that to convert it or uh yeah that would be good so you can use a publicly available uh API there might be some API present over there to convert it uh Other than",
  "present over there to convert it uh Other than that if I was if I had this question I and I was not able to find any other library I might have use Selenium for that purpose because there are some websites which allow you to freely convert these uh these videos or audios into transcriptions. But some are there which uh uh yeah so they allow them so they allow you to freely convert them when you are using their website but not using their API endpoints. So uh if I was not able to find uh",
  "API endpoints. So uh if I was not able to find uh particular API endpoint which is able to uh give me transcriptions I would have use selenium for that. And uh I know that selenium has not been taught to you but you can just go ahead and look into it. So it's a very basic code. Uh well I will not say it's basic. Uh it's a kind of code that a TDS student can understand and you will be able to get along with yeah but we have to download Selenium and do configuration. Selenium is just a Pythonic",
  "and do configuration. Selenium is just a Pythonic library. No we need Chrome right? You need a Chrome driver for that. uh you have to download the Chrome driver and uh in Azour how will be that's the uh in Azour we have to deploy right or some other in that case I assume that uh a container a docker or podman container will be able to take care of that okay okay yeah okay yeah so you can give it a try you can give it a try using selenium uh but or we can try using some common API you can use a",
  "or we can try using some common API you can use a common API as well. Let me just check which uh file we have given to you. Okay. Actually, I figured I can tell you how I solve this question. Yeah. In G. It's interesting. I just copied this link and opened and enabled transcription and copied all the text between those two intervals. Then paste it. Okay. Please repeat. I just copied the transcription which automatically enabled in our uh YouTube itself, right? Yeah. Yeah. With time stamp. I",
  "itself, right? Yeah. Yeah. With time stamp. I just copied and pasted it. It was working fine. Yeah. Then you can uh find an alternative for that using some kind of API as well, I guess. Yeah, that's the only thing I did. Yeah. So, you you took out the transcriptions on YouTube, right? Yeah. Directly from YouTube. There is a YouTube library. There is a YouTube library for that. I am not sure about the name but you can just chat GP8 and you will be able to find a Pythonic library for that and you",
  "able to find a Pythonic library for that and you will be able to find a bash command for that as well. [Music] Okay. So just go ahead and uh have a look at that. Okay. transcription which yeah for transcriptions. Okay. And um and for move file question we had right in J1 and all like we have to get the batch and hash hash value all so actually uh currently my scenario is that I'm using versel to deploy my app. Okay. I was testing my apps. Okay. And I did not use the uh I was did not use any",
  "And I did not use the uh I was did not use any subprocess modules as of now. But coming to the move file part I am not able to figure it out how it will work in vessel or any other deployments because only in local it's working fine the hash value generation for deployment it's not working for that for that you will have to use subprocess and uh have you used subrocess yet? Yeah, I have used sub process and in local it's working fine but while deploying to versel sub process will not work",
  "deploying to versel sub process will not work itself right. Yeah, I don't think that it will it will work on versel. Yeah. And uh I believe that uh there is this is a situation where containers come into play. You can run these kinds of processes in a container instead. Okay. Yeah. So I will I recommend you guys to use containers as a default. Okay. So for sure we have to use with Azour container those things. Yeah that's that's well defined. Okay. And uh one more thing I let me refer that",
  "Okay. And uh one more thing I let me refer that question in G4 itself. We had one question regarding GF4. Yeah. Yeah, regarding G one question was G actions and in GM one also same question same similar question was regarding G itself. So yeah, a Tuesday question. Yeah. So what do Yeah. So here we have to uh change our email ids every time, right? What's been passed or like how it works while evaluation? Yeah. So for this question I think Carlton said that it will not be parameterized. It will",
  "said that it will not be parameterized. It will make sense. Yeah, exactly. Email is going to be your email. Yeah. Okay. So all questions or just this one and another get question? Yeah. So they won't verify for good questions alone. Yeah. Okay. and URL based questions where deployments are happening that mean we have to we can use any URLs right for so can I can I like uh deploy a virtual endpoint and paste it instead of 8,000 or 9,000 uh you can work yeah so for deployment related questions",
  "can work yeah so for deployment related questions right in G8 so there we have to paste 8,000 9,4 ports we have to deploy our app. Okay. So instead of that can I pro have a program in versel that's been running throughout that is processing and pass that versel endpoint as an answer as well. That can be done as well. Uh yeah that can be done. You can have a virtual application already running and uh yeah this can be done. You can have a virtual application already been deployed and you can just",
  "already been deployed and you can just pass the yeah that URL alone will pass here. Anyways it's going to be query right note just that can be done right for all the questions with the URLs. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. and docker container question. What's what the solution did we have? Uh question number J2 only those deployment questions are I think like uh Carlton said in today's session GA2 question 8 uh for that particular question it's going to be our uh docker URL container URL with our",
  "to be our uh docker URL container URL with our image so that will not change so only people in this call will get marked for that looks like it Yeah. What is this? These are the benefits of attending live sessions. I am having job. What will I do? I'm currently working. You can collaborate on the common GitHub repos. taking this time some there are a lot of things from discord people are sharing groups and I am not aware of that okay by the way are you guys collaborating on some level create",
  "are you guys collaborating on some level create this project [Music] that's pretty good and that's what we encourage you you has to do as well. I am just checking that or if there's any other questions one one in G2 can you go to a there are one more question I guess that's regarding grog or something there was one more end point that was different than local endpoint I don't remember exactly the croc one. [Music] Uh was it in G3? I don't remember exactly. Yeah. Last question. G2 or G1. Yeah.",
  "exactly. Yeah. Last question. G2 or G1. Yeah. Yeah. Andrew. Okay. Yeah. This one I could not figure it out. No way. like lammo file is not been even while uh so for this particular question I think I got the answer. What you do is you download the file and you uh put it in your uh working directory and then from there you run the uh file name with hyphen server. So it automatically opens up a local host port and through that you simultaneously run another uh session and tunnel it using enro and",
  "another uh session and tunnel it using enro and if you do this inside a t-max session and then you detach from that session uh it's it continuously keeps running and you can use whatever forwarding port that you get from your enro you just copy paste that here and if it's continuously running inside the session it should work. So for all we can use the same URL. Yeah. Yeah, you can. So if you have done that question, I can copy that same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's great. Great insight.",
  "Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's great. Great insight. Okay. Uh so that also is sort I think that's all. Most of the things are sorted. I was spending with URL. Yeah. Any other questions guys or should we wrap up this session? Uh no questions from my end. Uh any other questions tell we can post and discuss right if yeah you can post and discuss you guys still have uh how many days uh five more days to go I not four more days to go starting today so I have solved only 41 questions that's good Kelvin",
  "have solved only 41 questions that's good Kelvin because uh when considering the probability uh you have you will be passing about five random questions and considering the probability so you are well yeah only using versel alone I have not used any else okay tell so I guess there are no other questions yet uh let's wrap up this session uh by the way tell Is versel able to uh you know work along with all those 44 oions? Yeah, I used everything using for and it was working fine for me. Oh,",
  "using for and it was working fine for me. Oh, that's pretty good. You don't have to even use Azure then. Yeah, that's what but subprocess question where like where rendering of a URL those type of question I am not able to figure it out also that PDF uh PDF plumber question also it will not work in that I have to figure it out PDF yeah one question related to PDF that file is changing right for sure okay uh PDF number one uh it can change okay yeah that one I am not able to figure it out. It's",
  "that one I am not able to figure it out. It's a bigger file PDF. Was that file parameterized for everyone? Was it for just question just question alone? File is same. The file is same. Probability is low but it's not n. Okay. But we cannot surely tell right that fail is constant or not. How will we throw that? That's the point. I think in today's session Carlton said that uh that file won't change. You have to load that file directly into the code and then you should be we should be able to do",
  "and then you should be we should be able to do all of the pre-processing for the file within our code with the data loaded in the code itself and then only based on uh what mark I mean based on the question as in with subjects and uh the marks filtering that part right only those that part will be parameterized. So the input file will also not be given was what he was saying. He said that load the entire thing as a CSV or as a data frame in inside that particular function and proceed in that",
  "that particular function and proceed in that manner. Oh, so PDF to CSV itself we can convert as yeah put it inside the function as a pass it as a data itself inside the function. So you just take the question uh uh that last line right the line that has the subject and the marks right okay that alone will be given as a question there is no file itself correct that's what he said s do you know what are which what are the actual questions which will be asked for everything because now there are",
  "be asked for everything because now there are few questions where file is not there then how to handle That's uh which questions are files not there? No, now she has informed right this question. We are not using file itself like that. Do we have any other questions where file is not passed itself? Look the thing is that uh we will be creating evaluations. So we know what all questions will students might face problems with. Okay. So you can expect bit line. Okay. So the tips and hints and",
  "expect bit line. Okay. So the tips and hints and inclinations we are getting here are very valuable. Yeah. Okay. And um yesterday you mentioned one thing regarding image processing the GFI 10 that you will be passing as a HTML and all image passing image has the image right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I figured it out a simpler way where we can just copy the paste and question and it was figuring out correctly where you can just copy paste the question directly and it will automatically extract all",
  "directly and it will automatically extract all the mappings correctly and regenerate it. Okay. So LLM will be able to no manually just just Python. I have not used LLM in my project. Okay. just using Python reject I extracted everything. Okay. So you were able to arrange these uh regarding these coordinates that yeah correctly itself I could add it just class B plus I have used okay that's uh what's expected and uh uh so considering that how you have to respond with the image is everything",
  "you have to respond with the image is everything clear on that part right yeah that's fine but uh input question will be just copy paste this question and passing or will it have like HTML or markdown fields That's what uh the input question that we will be sending it to you. It's in the API, right? Yeah. In in that case, we will be sending this particular question. I guess we will start it from here. Uh this particular question and along with that we'll be sending a file. So table also will be",
  "we'll be sending a file. So table also will be in the question itself or like h that's a good question. That's where the confusion is because you have mentioned it will be in markdown. I don't know you or gingra. It was mentioned like markdown there were after that they had mentioned like HTML. So I got confused itself. Oh it should be that okay. So for that uh I guess a markdown for that because last you're talking about yesterday's session. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yesterday took that session and",
  "Yeah. Yeah. So yesterday took that session and uh not yesterday in discourse I am speaking discourse you mentioned day before yesterday you have posted uh about this no ma yeah this question anyone else remember okay okay anyone else must have done that uh let me just open this post yeah uh can you pinpoint at uh what time that the post was it was uh three two days be like four days before that series only four days before. Yeah, that one only just just this one you No, no, no, no. You just saw",
  "just this one you No, no, no, no. You just saw that there were two products. Yeah, this one. No, just this one bound. No, that's a comment box. Scroll up. Scroll up. I think you saw that one again. Oh, this is 7 days, right? You are going up. Let me check that. Can you search HTML alone directly? Control F. Yeah, that would be HTML page. Yeah, that question. No, no, third post. Third post. Third one. Seven days ago. Yeah, this question there wasn't a play. sent a reply. Data file sent to the",
  "a play. sent a reply. Data file sent to the API will always be requesters local machine. Okay. Data file API format. Yeah. So file will be given to you as a B64. Oh not no not in binary formatting. Sorry. Sometimes the AP No, that's not the that one. That last one. Last one only. It's a replay, right? Last replay only regarding the table. This one it should be just let me just confirm it with Yeah. Yeah. I will just check that. discuss post itself environment. I'll just share that post itself",
  "environment. I'll just share that post itself cuz for me it's catching this here. Where is that? Uh yeah. So I confirmed it with Jiraj and the answer is that this particular table can be given to you as an HTML or as markdown as well. Mark means that's a file or like how it's in question. Markdown markdown as a markdown. Uh can be a file as or it can be given to you as uh I guess it will be a file or because files how will you give that's where the point is coming. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I am",
  "the point is coming. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I am asking for these questions can we have something some go point uh well what you can do is uh you can let's say if you received an HTML file so you can have uh so you know that either it will be an HTML file or a file so you have no we already have an image file right in passing you have an image file along with that you could get an HTML or the mark. So for that uh you can use uh conditions if there is an HTML content then you have to the file",
  "is an HTML content then you have to the file isn't that or if there is an so when it comes to lenency so that depends no no no not not like that I'm asking we are passing two files in same request right that how it will be working that's what I okay okay for two files uh let just check chat Because we Yeah, because we are having only one file in request, right? As of No, that's not a problem. You can send multiple files in a request. Uh let me have a look at it. Uh here is a file uploads. Let",
  "have a look at it. Uh here is a file uploads. Let me ask it. [Music] Yeah. So as you can see that to receive multiple files in pass API endpoint, you can modify your function to accept a list of upload file objects. That's also possible. So uh where is it? Then you can just change it to a list instead and you can then pass multiple files. As you can see that uh this is this this is the uh file list of files that we'll be sending it to you uh in this format. Okay. So based on this part also we",
  "this format. Okay. So based on this part also we have to understand. Yeah. So you can send multiple files. You can send multiple files in a request. That's not a problem. Okay. So, AP should be handling these two this. Yeah. Perfect. All right guys. So, if there are no further questions, let's end this session. Hi. Hi. Hi, sorry for joining late like I um Okay. So, um um okay. Uh so um I just have few questions like um so there are uh like it's like the previous one the artifacts are two one is",
  "the previous one the artifacts are two one is the API URL and then the uh the versal one and then the other one is the GitHub link. Is that correct? Uh well all these uh things have been discussed or uh yeah I didn't check the previous section. I just want to summarize is that the two things which we put it in that it's a G form link G for link there was a G for like um Google form link uh where we submit the solution these are only two things right we are talking about GS7 no no in this",
  "right we are talking about GS7 no no in this project uh for submission We should put only these two, right? Ah, okay. Okay, okay, okay. For submission, let me have a look. Okay, you have repos. No, the Google form link. Yeah, this is the Google form link and uh submit your G repository URL and your API endpoint URL in this Google. So you have to send your code and the API endpoint the particular uh uh endpoint the where you have deployed an application for. So for let's say if you are deployed",
  "for. So for let's say if you are deployed your application on Azure you have to give your Azure deployment URL. No let's consider it's versel. So it's still versel/appi that is the link which we have to send. Yeah. Yeah. So so whichever API whichever URL your versel gives you you have to you give over here. Okay. till / API. Okay. Okay. That's what Okay. Okay. Um yeah, that should be it for this. And then uh second thing is um um like uh that TDS exam, right? Actually like uh so um that is",
  "TDS exam, right? Actually like uh so um that is similar format to what we had earlier exams. Is it actually like uh that u you're talking about? Nter. Yes. Well, for that uh be not sure and uh I suppose that Carlton talked a lot about uh the end time exam in in the earlier part of this section earlier of this section. Earlier in this session, no this particular session at the very beginning he was talking about the end term. So you can just give it a watch. Oh today's some stuff and many said",
  "it a watch. Oh today's some stuff and many said that the upcoming week could be discuss. Yeah. So the thing is that we have to discuss a lot about uh end term on our end and uh that few things are fluid few things are not yet discussed. So uh that's just another region for us to ponder in for now our entire focus is on project two and uh I suppose that your focus should also be on project two at the moment. uh for enter we can discuss it in uh after this the next video. Okay. Okay. Okay. So",
  "after this the next video. Okay. Okay. Okay. So currently okay so and that is still maybe it will be discussed later. Okay. Yeah. So only these two actually like this one is clear the project um oh um the API was what I was checking. Okay. Still slash API that's all I wanted. Okay. Okay then that's it actually like fine. Thank you so much. Okay. So was no. So let's end the session guys. Thank you. And uh yeah, thanks a lot for joining and uh good night and all the best for Bye.",

  "effort we put in some um metrics with some weights uh which then evaluates the quality of your submission. So uh based on those autoc calculated the evaluation then uh we uh come up with uh a score for the bonus. So that's how a bonus was decided. Uh so again like I said uh as far as bonuses go it will heavily depend on what we see in the final picture of project two. Okay, if uh it looks like there's a normal distribution, then there's unlikely to be any bonus because that means project two",
  "to be any bonus because that means project two was imminently doable. So there is no need to um do any extra padding or anything of that sort. Right? So that's uh that's what we Okay. So I think JRaj is in the session. uh he will uh conduct today's session and uh he will take you through the agenda and uh the topics for today which is uh of course end term and he will uh discuss all the things that will be uh required in the end term. One good piece of information I always can give to you is",
  "piece of information I always can give to you is end terms in TDS are probably some of the easiest end terms you will ever get in the diploma and that's been true every term. uh it's uh and it's not going to change for this term. Okay. So if you uh watch this session or participate in this session uh people who do that for end terms in tious who watch these sessions they almost always do very well in them. Okay. So don't ignore these sessions these today's session and Thursday's session. So if",
  "today's session and Thursday's session. So if you ignore it it's at your own peril. So that's why I'm telling you in the beginning itself okay but even if you do not watch them it will still be easy but you will probably regret not watching the session because you could have picked up some pointers and some tips that would have actually helped you. Okay so I'll hand over to thanks like Oh, is it Is it okay now? Okay. Okay. So what I will do is I will go through these uh different modules and",
  "I will go through these uh different modules and then I will highlight the part from where questions are highly likely to come. So this is uh VS code uh basically so it's not that uh important and there is almost nothing that can be asked from here and yeah this UV is something that is uh useful in writing this script. sir. You are not audible. Uh yeah. Am I audible now? Yes sir. Uh all right. Okay. Okay. So I was saying uh in this UV there might be some questions related to how do you run the",
  "be some questions related to how do you run the script and and what is purpose of this dependencies but that is also highly unlikely. Then there is this uh httpx. So like what is usage of node package manager? Can we get some example on few topics like how will the question be frame? Yeah, like if it is an important topic, I will give you the example. But uh this npx also is not that important just that uh it is some uh package manager that's all you need to know about it. And uh basically you",
  "you need to know about it. And uh basically you can install these libraries and then you can use it uh in creating data visualization tool or something like that. And yeah this is very important uh this might be there. This is related to encoding stuff. So uh if you are trying to open a particular file then you need if if you uh don't know its encoding let us say if you just open the file without providing the encoding and I think by default while opening any file it uses UTF8 as the encoding",
  "opening any file it uses UTF8 as the encoding but if it's encoding is not I'm not sure if it is by default um if it is UTF8 or not But uh let us say if there is some other encoding then you need to provide that encoding. So this is something that is also important to know. So this is how you can uh chart that is the library that allows you to detect the encoding of any file. Just read it as bits and then you can use charit detect to detect the encoding. So this is something useful detecting the",
  "So this is something useful detecting the encoding and then reading it in that particular encoding. So it is also there in one of the graded assignment I guess. So it must be there in the GA1 itself one question is there. So you can just go through that. Yeah this is something um question might come from and then browser tools. So this is one thing that is highly very likely some question might come because in every term in past questions have been coming from this topic browser tools and",
  "been coming from this topic browser tools and particularly this CSS selector is most important one. How do you select a particular element uh from the DOM? Uh so uh yeah so these uh console tableable group time these these are not that important but knowing how to construct a um query for selecting elements from DOM structure is really important. So it can be XML or uh h HTML. So focus on this stuff how you can select something from the DOM and then few questions like um where can you locate",
  "then few questions like um where can you locate the DOM? So DOM is usually located inside the elements tab and then on the console console tab I mean Dom is not there but then you can use query selector and then query selector all. These are the two methods that allow you to uh select the tags and then select. Yeah, this is get element by ID is another stuff and then I think get element by class is another thing. But the most important one is how do you create uh construct the query that is",
  "how do you create uh construct the query that is usage of uh oh where is my yeah over here. So document dot query selector and then whatever you put inside this will be your query selector and then you can look over the different query selectors over here. MDN MDN docs CSS select or and these are combinators these are selectors. So these are the two that are most important. Okay. Yeah. This is how you can select a particular class and then this This is for a particular child of a particular",
  "This is for a particular child of a particular parent. And then this at red used page selecting uh anchor tag uh with some uh some type which which have some thing in title. So title should not be null and then href should be equal to this particular value. It will select those tags. So uh these are the things that are important and then which is exactly value uh represents the value with an attribute name of attribute whose value is white is separated with the list of words. Which piece I'm",
  "separated with the list of words. Which piece I'm on? I'm onore speech. Uh what should we select from here? We need to look at that. You are not audible. Okay. Am I audible now? Yes. What is the reason behind this? I'm just trying to figure out one question that has sector one. Was it asked in last term or Okay, at the moment I'm not able to find out the question on the CSS selector but uh uh this is something that is important to uh focus on like uh how do you select based on the attribute and",
  "uh how do you select based on the attribute and then these are something that are not that much used and then class B selector and then IDB selector and then these so just go through these two uh one is selectors and then uh second is these combinators like what does this thing mean? uh like can anyone explain what does this mean mean ul so what is ul and then this is like sub element like whatever is under this ul I am not sure about my yeah dot represents class so it is selecting all ul with",
  "represents class so it is selecting all ul with this particular class it is written also it's some reports the children. Yeah, it is for immediate children. So basically if I open it doesn't come body and then closing tag of body. And let us say within this ally we have another ally. So this particular oh yeah this one if we do ul and then greater than li so it will just select uh this bit it won't select the inner bit but anyway this inner bit is inside this so it will also get selected but",
  "is inside this so it will also get selected but individually it won't select this what I mean is it will select this whole element but it won't select this as individual but if there is a space between them. Then it will select this as individual and then it will also select this as one individual. Uh pardon me in terms of yeah I was talking about these two space li and then ul greater than li. Okay. So this will uh this first one which is on the line number 17 will select this one and this",
  "the line number 17 will select this one and this one. So it will get us node list of uh two elements. One is this element and then another is this element. Whereas this one will get us node list of one element. If I if I do something like this document.query Query selector all this one and then this will be node list of two elements. And then from this particular uh so this is where uh there might be some questions like something related to where can we see information related to all the",
  "where can we see information related to all the network activity like uh some requests going to back end. So those kind of things you can see at network tab and then inside application tab you can uh check the storage location like local storage what all is there and then session storage and then where you can figure out your cookies session cookie so this is where you can figure out your session cookies and then within network tab as well if I look at any particular request so inside this",
  "I look at any particular request so inside this headers also those things are listed out. I mean it will be there as well. So these are the things that are useful from browser dev tools. Then CSS selectors we have already talked about them. Yeah, it is pointing to the same location. And what is this one? Increasingly challenging levels. Oh wow. Uh okay. I also did not know about this. I think this is some fun game. [Music] And uh select the bentos box. So you need to select these two. And what",
  "box. So you need to select these two. And what is over here? Uh select the fancy table. So this is what you need to select. And over here select an apple on the plate. So this is is it this one? Yeah, this one. And how do I use it? Okay, I think this will work. So, we need to select the pickle on the fancy table. So first I need to do table and then yeah this is the one. So immediate uh children plate with ID fancy and then This is how we do this. What do you guess it again? Sir in an also will",
  "What do you guess it again? Sir in an also will we get question like this? No no no no. Oh this is just to practice. Anyway I will move on. Uh there might be some question uh options and then questions might be around that. I'm just uh emphasizing more on this browser dev tools and then CSS selectors. So just focus on these two things from the selector point of view. uh focus on uh some attributes mostly attribute based selectors basic selectors and if you not much difficult combinators but",
  "and if you not much difficult combinators but yeah this was there I didn't know about it CSS where you can practice selecting elements and then uh any back end or APIs they will send you JSON data. So it is important how to parse JSON data. So this is how you can convert uh if there is some JSON object then this is how you can convert it to a string and then this is how you can load a string into JSON. So this is for how the data is coming if it is in the string format and then uh JSON is just",
  "is in the string format and then uh JSON is just similar to dictionary. So uh getting any particular uh this name or if this name have a list then those things all those things are pretty easy. Then there are ways to read JSON into the pandas as well. So just know about uh the JSON structure that's important to know. Then from terminal bash uh this is copying things. Then this is for moving things. This is for removing. Yeah, this text processing might be something that might come. Uh so search",
  "might be something that might come. Uh so search for some pattern inside a file. Um this is yeah I have this over here and I will need some file for doing it and then this set won't be that much important cuz this it also have some how do you like you using this is for S is for substituting. So it matches with some pattern and then it replaces it with uh new stuff but searching is more important than uh replacing anything. It involves searching and then replacing as well. So set won't be that",
  "and then replacing as well. So set won't be that important but uh GP might come but it is not something that uh you need to focus too much on. And curl is uh used for sending a request to a URL and then getting its response. And you can even save it in files. This is for downloading files. I would say focus more on grap and then this sort you will intuitively know what is what it is doing don't look at these options very basic question might be there which just uses sort so it will just sort",
  "there which just uses sort so it will just sort things Anyways, I would say focus on G and then pattern matching stuff which is more important and then in terms of a spreadsheet, Excel and then Google Sheets. there won't be stuff uh particularly related to any formulas or something like that. Uh so this is also and uh with regards to database how to query database and creating tables is not what we might ask you. Inserting is also not something we might ask but uh uh selecting something from",
  "we might ask but uh uh selecting something from the table uh this is something that is useful and then grouping things and then um something like uh merging things. So these joins are there these inner joins and then uh so this will select whatever is common between these two tables. It will join them. Then this is left join. This is right join. These things. So this is for inner join and then there should be something like out this this is basic join. These keywords just changes and these",
  "basic join. These keywords just changes and these things can be done in the panda's thing. Then with regard to the uh GitHub um mostly how to uh add all anything. So after you add something it will start tracking the history of uh those changes. Let us say if you add some file then if you commit it then it will consider it as one commit. [Music] So it remembers the version. This is after every commit it creates version of the files and then you can move between other versions and then this is",
  "can move between other versions and then this is how you can push and then pulling is there listing branches then switching branches. So these are the important bits knowing how to push and pull and then commit and adding things. How are you? Then image compression is there. [Music] So this tells you can what is image dimensions and then are lossless and lossy. Uh just watch this video. So something around these definitions might be there but not uh too much to focus on and then how what is",
  "not uh too much to focus on and then how what is GitHub pages. So everyone is aware about these how to create GitHubes. Yeah, these are basically get push and then on the GitHub uh UI through the UI itself you can uh publish to it to the pages. So I won't spend much time on that and then uh introd this is about Google collab and yeah fast API is what we are using so much so there might be question related to fast API itself what it is used for and and some some something that is uh very",
  "for and and some some something that is uh very important is uh like if I just how do you add codes to the application? I think it must be there. Sir, I'm a bit confused like will we get theory question or will we get practical question? What type of question will we get because this latest is vast. Like this is like a summary of system command macro and uh like using the Python to uh that wouldn't be questions that are related to syntax or something very specific uh like there might be",
  "or something very specific uh like there might be something like uh how do you add codes to fast API application and then JSON processing might be there. So there is one thing that uh tells you yeah this is the one these are the something uh uh access control allow origin this is used for allowing which all uh websites can send request to this your application and then this is for controlling methods and then headers and then credentials. Yeah, adding course is important as well. MSQ or MSQ",
  "adding course is important as well. MSQ or MSQ type. MS, it can be MCQ and MSQ as well. And it can be NAT as well. If there is some NAT type question, you might have to do some calculations and then solve them. If I show you a previous term paper there was one h sign distance stuff was there formula would be given or like how yeah yeah formula will be given just give me one second I will show you tools it's not here was it here okay it's here and which one it is this is September two. Oh no,",
  "and which one it is this is September two. Oh no, this is not what you want. Sir, I have a one question that uh should we read the PIQS or not or directly follow the only course introduction? uh it is better to go through because uh WhatsApp told that this time all the question but will be changed so that's why questions question pattern will be similar these there are two new modules are there that's Which are those two which are different this time? They just these two are the new new bits",
  "time? They just these two are the new new bits development and deployment to everything else. Huh? Yeah. Everything is mostly same from the last one. Do mean sorry J you mean weightage is high for development and tools or No no no no these are new uh that these are new that are introduced in the course that's okay yeah so this is the one that asks you to do some calculation where sign formula is provided to you and this is the actual The first step is to calculate the distance and then between",
  "is to calculate the distance and then between these two things which of the following is current correct distance to these two. So formula is also provided over here. So if some calculation based question comes which is NAT uh like where you have to type in the answer then most oh this is also have options but if there is something that requires calculation formula will be there. Okay. sample steps also will be there, right? Yeah. So, can we consider that if we saw last two three PQs that you",
  "that if we saw last two three PQs that you sufficient and you should also go through these uh this course portal. So, if you do that much then it will be good. So for uh if we complete the portal and last two three pyqs can we consider that there's a high probability that we score credit considering that we have scored quite decently in ro g as well as ps. Yes. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. So this is GitHub action. So on push events and these things it can do certain tasks running these",
  "things it can do certain tasks running these commands. And then uh so from this one how you pull something that is remote and then how you can run and then listing containers stopping some containers. Uh this is not something to focus on. Then removing some containers. So these are some like pushing uh pulling and then running. These are the most important one. and then building as well. These are the four important stuff from docker thing and sir will there be any mock for TDS regarding the",
  "sir will there be any mock for TDS regarding the new modules like regarding that. So this is one TDS GPT that is created. Sir, actually this doesn't work. For some people it works and for some it doesn't. How about this one? Yes. Could you refine the S system with latest datas? Because in some cases while trying a few of them I got the perfect answers like we have seven modules. In some cases we are getting weird answers like there are 10 modules, eight modules, seven modules, six modules. So",
  "eight modules, seven modules, six modules. So it's not working properly in some uh some cases. Oh, this is quite similar to what we are facing every different Beautiful. [Applause] Okay. Earlier when I asked it, it was corrected. Oh, this is something else. Earlier when I used it, it generated the correct one. I mean along with this is the wrong one and this is the correct one. Exactly sir. But in some cases we are seeing this. So how can we rely on this portal that this assistant that it will",
  "on this portal that this assistant that it will give correct answers like we tried as Kran mentioned that try using this to generate questions for practice and when we were we were doing it wasn't generating proper questions. Okay. So what needs to be done in this case? Can you give it a set prompt? Uh this is what I used. Um preparing for an interm examination module one. Uh did you feed the modules to your model? Like is it working because you already gave him the modules? for the uh no I",
  "you already gave him the modules? for the uh no I haven't changed it for changed anything at my end I think I cannot even edit uh it I don't have permissions to edit anything inside this GPT so can you please go uh go and like not now in later stage will you go and check what prompts you are using and can you just share it on discourse or via mail so that we can them to generate questions and play ice or else this portal won't uh help much. [Music] Uh okay we'll discuss about that also like I",
  "Uh okay we'll discuss about that also like I have a suggestion can you provide this model like whosoever can elute can you provide him the endm exam so that when we ask a prom it can give a similar question to our end like also get an idea uh Okay. Give us Okay. better better providing a mock in portal would be better rather than if it's not working properly for her. Yeah. Okay. Tell me I will discuss it with the instructors also. uh and this nrock is used for tunneling. If some let us say you",
  "is used for tunneling. If some let us say you want to you have developed something and you want somebody else to test it. So this is what you can use. So in inside this uh course these are origins and then methods and headers. These are three different things that are important. And what is use of u con? It can be used to launch the server. If you create fast API applications, this helps to launch the server and then uh these parameters can come as uh the query and and like URL encoded",
  "can come as uh the query and and like URL encoded parameters. And then they can also come through if it's a post request it like it doesn't matter what is the type of the request. Uh there are two kind two types of uh two ways how data can come in. One is through the body and then one is through these URL encoding parameters. What you should do is just read through the course portal and practice it. What about the mock which is planned? Is it going to happen or not? Uh I'm not sure about the",
  "going to happen or not? Uh I'm not sure about the mock but uh a few suggestions that I can give is uh go through these um ent papers till Jan 24 because that's when LLM was introduced. So till here at least go through the papers. and then also go through this portal as well because it have new stuff and I can request for the uh mock send us for this one you are asking about right? Yeah yeah yeah it will be helpful for all of us also paste it in discourse also so people can see Uh you can post",
  "discourse also so people can see Uh you can post it on discourse. Have you sent it? Yeah, I have sent it. So uh for LMS how you can create the basic uh uh chat completions prompt uh usage your model and then messages uh system prompt and then there is one more user prompt and then how do you look for so whenever you send some requests to uh open AI in the response it also uh gets you information about how many tokens you have used, how many input tokens and output tokens. So based on that how",
  "tokens and output tokens. So based on that how [Music] to so understanding those things are important and then there might be some pricing. So you just need to multiply pricing with the tokens and then uh get the answer something like that. How much price does it take if you uh So to some request response might be shown. These many tokens were used and then some pricing might be given and then uh tell us the cost that it that was used and how to get uh the response in the structured format. not",
  "get uh the response in the structured format. not that much useful and then B64 is used for image URIs. So that's what is there and embeddings is the most important one I can say. So if you want to know about uh like in project to to identify the questions few students would have used embeddings. So this is also something important to know. Uh get the embeddings and then multiply them sorry uh dot product get the dot product and then you can get the cosine similarity which tells how similar",
  "get the cosine similarity which tells how similar these two sentences or words or documents are. So medings is one important stuff. And the function calling is something that is again I can say it's useful like creating this naming then description and then parameters these individual types and properties What is additional properties these things so for scraping using Excel I think import HTML or something is there is it [Music] import functions are there just remember their names and usage",
  "are there just remember their names and usage okay import HTML is there in the uh Google Sheets. So, some other stuff might be there in Excel as well. Open and then from web star. import XML. XML is another type of file. Uh in PyQs you can find a lot of questions related to these things, Google Sheets and Excel. uh instead of uh particularly BBC weather location API how to create API request adding headers and those things are important and then uh browser dev tools is something that is",
  "then uh browser dev tools is something that is important um network related activity or application tab knowing those things not particularly this BBC stuff but how to send request and then beautiful soup is something request and then beautiful soup these are important bits should we like just see all the videos at 3x speed uh don't watch the videos I will say go through these listed topics it's a we have already studied So it is good recall. Uh but I there are so many topics. So how do you",
  "Uh but I there are so many topics. So how do you propose that we go through all of it? So says there is somebody although I I shouldn't speak for others but like uh how what is the best way to approach this because of the uh variety of topics which are Jas can I ask a question? Uh check out the pyqs and over from there you will get the idea about uh these things and uh yeah tell so map map the topics bases what has been done. Yeah. Map the topics based on that. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Was anyone seeing",
  "based on that. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Was anyone seeing something? Uh so web scraping something that might that that is definitely going to come most probably and then uh usage of request and then in beautiful zoo particularly uh CSS selector stuff are you hear me now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, is the end paper prepared or is it is going to be prepared? Just one uh it's prepared but uh we don't have visibility to it. Okay. So, is there any question similarity between the previous terms and",
  "similarity between the previous terms and this? Yes, question similarity will be there. Similarity is there right? So if we have a glance on the previous terms and based on that if you search on the endear module we can get an idea how to solve right. Yes because I saw the search module in like our page itself top we have right that one we can use right this one. Yeah. And does it do semantic v searching? Yeah, everything it will if you want to ask request then it will search everything. Okay.",
  "ask request then it will search everything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this is something that you can use. Okay. But I will say uh go through these things and uh just uh I mean end term for TDS is very easy. So if you will go through these uh pqs you will know about it. These projects and roe are difficult but uh end term is really very easy super easy. So at this point uh I think uh this datetime module is also very important like how you parse states. I think there are few functions called strf",
  "I think there are few functions called strf date or something like that. Is it str? Yes, few functions like this. So you create a new date using this module and uh where is your waste your time? So yeah, so this is what uh like how to get in this particular format if you want this is how you can get. So dollar A what is what it is used for dollar D what it is used for dollar B what it is used for these things quite usual to remember. So these uh parsing dates is also a common stuff that comes",
  "parsing dates is also a common stuff that comes in term and beautiful soup json pandas pandas and then re module like in pandas and uh anything like filtering is something that uh is also of like how do you filter using pandas that might be important to know or some other way as well. So I think it is called filter function in pandas. Is it filter or what? Uh filter apply. These are two three um important bits. So in beautiful soup particularly how to construct uh selector is important to know",
  "how to construct uh selector is important to know about that. So how to uh scrape something using JavaScript is uh you use query selector and query selector all those two things are there and then what is map function like like let us say you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 and If you want to square them so you can use map function to square those things. So you can apply any function to it. So those kind of things and this is accessing the developer tool inspecting elements query selector then extracting",
  "elements query selector then extracting text content. I think uh it is.ext ext and then function link programming map is something that is usual in data structure copying data that is copy function and then convert to a spreadsheet that's also not too much use text offers I So yeah, these are uh important bits I can say. And then knowing what nominate them does is also important. This is again an API based uh how to get data [Music] from like there is one Wikipedia module that is present in the",
  "is one Wikipedia module that is present in the Python. So install it and then you can do keyword VS fetching. It's not uh too important. Put very less efforts on this. put more efforts on generic uh API requesting and getting data and then storing JSONs those kind of stuff. basically fast API, JSON and some library table maybe fast API application and then from database how to get something like how to form how to use request module to create requests that is also useful to know particularly",
  "requests that is also useful to know particularly Wikipedia is not that much useful And yeah this is a regarding tabula. So if you there is during roies we have talked about tabula. It is basically for parsing. [Music] like I've really just used the pioneer PDF because that performs better but this specific thing I want to comment it has been a lifesaver in terms of extracting stuff from videos although I have a software in one of the computers but yeah this is like if you do not have any other",
  "yeah this is like if you do not have any other software just use this package I just I have just written one script anytime I need to extract images I just run that file so it is like a tool extra tool now this is Get used to these pime PDF and these things. So I think there is one or two line of code that is used. This is empty. I think there is a scraping XML and HTML and then caching redundancies and then benefit of these things error handling, debugging, troubleshooting. Okay. Oh. Uh yeah.",
  "debugging, troubleshooting. Okay. Oh. Uh yeah. Software open what it is used for? Uh so these kind of questions might be there uh regarding a particular software what it is used for not how to use so but what it is used for kind of thing and I think this gets data from the PDF. Okay. So, finding and piecing. Is it like a basic recall test key? If you have gone through the course, you'll probably remember all of this stuff. Yeah, it is mostly about the recall test not uh something related",
  "about the recall test not uh something related particularly to the code or syntax. Okay. So make sure we read once everything and yeah just go through the basic stuff we have done. If we have obviously done our assignments ourselves, you should be able to remember all of this. Yeah. Yeah. Mostly you will be able to remember everything. It will recall test. But few things like uh uh something like CSS selectors and then these kind of things might be more to focus on but mostly like and then in",
  "be more to focus on but mostly like and then in course what are the important uh things headers is there method is there then origin is there so remember these things is usual What about data analysis that seventh module? Will there be any deep questions on that? Uh okay, I will go to that module later. First let me look at this one. Finding and replacing changing the data format and then the removing extra spaces that is trim function. Now basic functions are there. This is about data",
  "Now basic functions are there. This is about data transformation, calculating, filtering. Filtering is also useful. Um creating charts, counting data occurrences, that's fine. Splitting in text that is okay. Data aggregation in Excel, data clean up, creating Excel, data manipulation. Yeah. Yeah. These things extracting week, month, year. This is uh weak num function. It is you asked in almost every term in past uh terms it is asked in almost every term datab duplicate is used for getting",
  "every term datab duplicate is used for getting something from the uh fetching the data from websites and then this is used for compressing and decompressing and then yeah this is also fine. This grap is most useful among these things and then these curl and fetching data then chipping it is also important and then this pattern matching is also um more important and anyway these are uh like what is useful of each one of these knowing that much would be good sorting finding. Okay, this is fine.",
  "be good sorting finding. Okay, this is fine. Yeah, open refine. What what are the usage of it? Like it how how does it work? It uh uses some clustering algorithm to merge similar things. And yeah uh after these videos there are these notebooks. So just also go through these notebooks. If there is something important then that will be there. Like if I just go through these notebook it will help you to recall things that's all outlayer detection. What is outliers? And then correlation between",
  "What is outliers? And then correlation between different stuff that is also useful. And then handling missing values. These three are these four are to focus on. Then parsing JSON not particularly uh with all tools but how do you parse it? This is panda SQL JSON. Uh transforming images is not that much of any uh like uh that that is something that uh can come in term like particularly Uh these brightness contrast highly unlikely to come in the end. Then what is use of module YTDLP? This might",
  "end. Then what is use of module YTDLP? This might be something uh to know about. So why what is useful use of uh this FMEG extracting audio and video for these purposes. So these things might be useful. So just uh know what are use of these things not the exact exact syntax but uh at least use case and then whisper is used for uh getting the transcriptions and those things and Jimny is also used. Oh yeah, the this is data analysis module like correlation is there a very useful thing. And then",
  "is there a very useful thing. And then this is uh regression is also there. And then these uh p values what are the these specific terminologies might be useful to know. and then knowing these names for cat for cast. For cast function these things are also good things. So these uh these are this is data analysis is the old one. So uh you can find questions related to data analysis in previous term um terms and there are no changes in it as well. And then this is for outlier detection. So these",
  "And then this is for outlier detection. So these things are there. Data analysis with Python reading parket files that is PD. Then percentage calculation correlation analysis correlation and datetime handling. So parsing dates is also important and extracting data. Yeah, this is also something that is more important and correlation is also important database. How to connect database? I think uh connecting database uh it's here or somewhere in one of these there is some code that is related to",
  "of these there is some code that is related to connecting databases. Yes, I mean that is the last code class. No no I think uh some publicly available database some myql stuff is there in this notebook. Yeah, this is how you create the connection string and then yeah this SQL alchemy SA.create create engine. This is allows you to connect to database and then after you connect to the database engine, you can query it using pandas as well, file format, comparisons, faster queries, SQL memory",
  "format, comparisons, faster queries, SQL memory efficient joining data, data collection and then data prep-process processing, map creation, visualization, storytelling. What is over here? So yeah from uh this one uh GSP analysis so distance calculation so there is one module I guess what is this what it name is I I will tell when it's come GI is it GIO coders and then nominate you can import nominatives and then this allows you to get the location address and then latitude and longitude. So if",
  "address and then latitude and longitude. So if you if you import geo this I think these three geo locator dot geo code. So getting uh the location is something that might be asked. So something related to geopy numpy every everybody knows about it. Pandas also [Music] is I remember there was one network stuff. Yeah this is the one. Yeah. Uh so the the yeah these two sign one sir uh I think the sign questions were also there in the end term. Sorry I could not get can you repeat? Uh yes sir say",
  "I could not get can you repeat? Uh yes sir say sign questions were there in the end term. So how do we have to do them like formula is there right? Yeah. The chart GPT like it's a scenario based question. Yeah. Yeah. So how do we have to do those like there were more than one parts about two three parts of that question where we have to calculate the distance and the whole pathway. Yeah. But uh formula is given over there. It it's a lengy question I know. But over here actually this is the",
  "I know. But over here actually this is the formula. I remember there is one way to compare using these sign values. Uh exactly I don't remember now but uh that way it is easy to answer. Um was it what about the dark sign and all what are those? They don't know right. So [Music] it the answers are really close so guessing won't work I think. you ask the question about can you go to the question? Yeah. It's asking distance, right? Yeah, it's asking for the distance. Distance, right? Can we",
  "asking for the distance. Distance, right? Can we directly calculate like straight so bad within that like distance calculation is not possible directly. But this comparison one the next one this is something that can be done which is the closest based on sign comparisons between their sign stuff. So in one of the questions it also has like the nearest latitude and longitude I think the down the third question. Yeah this is the third one. No, no. This is not this one. What is this arc sign that",
  "This is not this one. What is this arc sign that just tell me I would understand what is that arc sign? This is so these values seem to be Thank you. Actually last time regarding this question people raised it on discourse even I did not me and Carlton personally did not like this question and later they decided to make it a bonus question. I don't know what is this arc sign that yeah it's unnecessarily confusing inverse only there okay okay sine inverse that's sign inverse nothing but is it",
  "inverse that's sign inverse nothing but is it mentioned over here I Actually me and Carlton we both opposed this question and then later they decided to remove it from that's when these questions are fine because we expecting here we are not expecting the main now we will because [Music] Yeah. Okay. If something like this happens then uh it can later be erased on this course and then can be resolved like ar sign it's not mentioned over here what exactly it is I think nowhere sign already in the",
  "exactly it is I think nowhere sign already in the calculator it is available sign inverse is also there if you know what ar sign is all you have to do is put but then you have to know what is ar sign ah you have to know what is but still it's difficult to understand logics right because we have to get that root of that values getting root and everything is fine. This arc is something no it's cosine cosine into cosine we have to do that's value then sin inverse of some sin square you have to do",
  "sin inverse of some sin square you have to do right how would you do actually what what happens is in tds it is uh uh students used to get everything done very quickly so these questions are like uh which of the following fields are necessary to get uh these things so these are very like you used to do them in 1111 minutes and there are like uh uh 30 40 questions. So you managed to do it within uh 20 to 30 minutes. That's why you did have these kind of questions. No. Yeah, that's fine. I am",
  "kind of questions. No. Yeah, that's fine. I am asking in our calculator we don't have sign square itself. So how get the square of sign? It's not sign into sign right. I think sin square is uh whatever you calculate uh you do a square of that isn't it? No no no no then it's a value square right sin square it's different right like 2 sin theta cos theta we make right like that it might be different right then why should they should have given like whole bracket of square right sin square you",
  "like whole bracket of square right sin square you require a lot of trigonometry to solve it if you are manually solving it no I I I have doubt this that how will we get in cases Just calculate we have sin square 2 sin theta cos theta 1 formula we can use the theta will remain the same and then we can calculate sin theta cos theta by the calculator yeah that is 2 theta but here it's square right that's why I got confused what is the x yeah I think sine in this case it is just the square of that",
  "sine in this case it is just the square of that value. Okay, it is not sign of the under think square. I think these two things are equivalent. That's what I remember right now. So you are telling can we make it at 1 + cossine theta by theta because every both the sides we can divide right? Can we do that? in formula. If you see, we can try that one. Either way is fine. If we get the square of that sign that that we calculate the value and square it. If we get the square of the internal thing,",
  "it. If we get the square of the internal thing, we just square the internal value and then we take sign of that. Shouldn't we get those also? We cannot do it here. It's a radians, right? Not degrees, right? That's another confusion here we have right now. I guess the only way is to calculate or maybe just uh put the question in chat GPT and then ask it to explain then match the answers and then see what presumptions are taken. Can we get chip assistance in exam? It would be great. [Music] Uh",
  "assistance in exam? It would be great. [Music] Uh yeah this is same I also got confused like how do you so we have to give in degrees right theta so you calculate sin theta and then you square whatever you get the value and sin theta you can calculate and I think S function takes values in degrees. So if it is given in radians then you might have to convert it to degrees. Hello. Conversion has been given but like if you do not remember it it hasn't been given radians is non whatever 180\u00b0 uh yes",
  "been given radians is non whatever 180\u00b0 uh yes pi by 180\u00b0 Okay, just one question. These are paper being said by CH GP. Uh this last one, huh? This one uh this was created by this GPT. Okay. This ITM TDS teaching assistant is uh GPT is designing our paper. Huh? Last term I don't know about this term. This time I also don't know who is designing the paper. Last time they used uh GPT. I think this term they haven't highly unlikely cuz last time they designed because there was very less time for",
  "designed because there was very less time for designing the paper. system paper was created lot earlier I think it's been one month or something so this is very unlikely that they would have used GPT to create people and then this SK It work not of too much. I think uh distance calculation is something you can expect how to calculate that and then uh these kumu network analysis with kumu all these things uh not too much u to do here this distance calculation whatever is there in these notebooks",
  "calculation whatever is there in these notebooks is more useful. This is forecasting. This is PowerPoint. This is flourish. This is Google like about these uh particular tools Excel then PowerPoint um what are difference between them and those kind of things uh what is kumu what kind of analysis you can do you can create a networks using them so knowing that might be useful and then Google charts or you can just use to create some charts data studio it is I didn't cover this part properly did",
  "it is I didn't cover this part properly did you also have some videos on uh Q just at QGIS Yes, one video is there. Okay. Okay. But from momentum perspective, it more uh it is not uh too important. It's just interesting. So that Yeah, it is interesting from endm perspective from module one. uh this yes selector then then this JSON thing then bash is also uh like important to know about grap and those things and then browser dev tools is also important then database how do you query something to",
  "then database how do you query something to database and then with respect to git and github how to uh do initialization adding remote urls and then uh pushing and pulling and committing so those are important bits in that And then uh from deployment uh GitHub pages is there and uh GitHub actions and then from docker docker run pushpull those kind of things and then course what is uses of enrock those kind of things from large language models particularly how to construct the uh simple list um",
  "how to construct the uh simple list um which uh query something like this which just have some user prom some system form. So remembering uh their structure and then uh these pricing given the number of tokens used and then price per token they might ask you to calculate the pricing or something like that and then extracting uh response in a particular clean format. So LLM is what they are focusing more on and then embeddings these are used for finding identical or like matching terms and then",
  "finding identical or like matching terms and then vector database is used for storing embeddings. So this is just one theoretical question that is there and then function calling it's been heavily used already in P1 and I think yeah P1 and P2 might as well some students might have used and then data sourcing how you use API calls to get data. So there are two three ways getting data by sending some request you get uh you send some request it will get you some response. It might be JSON format,",
  "get you some response. It might be JSON format, it might be HTML format. If it is HTML format, how to use uh beautiful soup and those things. And if it is uh JSON, you can parse it using JSON those things. And in beautiful soup again CSS selector is there. And then this tabula stuff is there. and then particularly data preparation or removing duplicates. So these kind of things are there which are more useful and yeah the this is something important page like usage of uh these commands and open",
  "page like usage of uh these commands and open what it is used for uh with Python uh outlier detection correl relation analysis. In almost every term there is one question related to correlation I guess and then this is about parsing JSON transforming images is not too important from endm perspective and then extracting audio is not that much important. This is correlation. This is regression. This is forecasting. Go through these ones. And then in geo uh spatial thing uh how to calculate",
  "then in geo uh spatial thing uh how to calculate distance and then like felium is used for data visualization. So knowing these things is also good and go through these notebooks if there is something that is useful. Uh she file nothing much. Yeah, these are the two. I think over here they have used network X. Yeah. Uh so how do you create graph using network adding nodes and then um there are ways to get like it is used for for finding the shortest path and those things. So check this out",
  "shortest path and those things. So check this out network X module Yeah, that is all good for what I can say. Jas for correlation will they ask like it's just the highest correlator like that or you have to calculate I think some pandas related question how to use pandas.curl See you on. Okay. Like that. Yeah. bit late. What happened actually before like 4:30? Mhm. Before 5:30 what happened? Were there any conversation apart from the intimation? Uh can you please repeat once again? No. Before",
  "Uh can you please repeat once again? No. Before 5:30 were there any conversation apart from the end time preparation or like project based like that were there any uh tell I'm not able to understand what any discussion on project ah no no no yeah so before 5:30 you're asking yeah yeah 530 so we were discussing about end term from the very get go uh yeah so we were discussing about project to evaluation And uh the uh students were asking if their evaluations have been conducted and their scores",
  "evaluations have been conducted and their scores are yet to be released or not. That was something that uh we were discussing but uh after that we were discussing that rest you can just go to the meeting recording after the session and you can have a look at it. and project one scores are final right it will not change uh project one scores are final right which is pushed to the yeah scores are final any other questions Ready? S by tomorrow day after tomorrow will you get the project to score",
  "after tomorrow will you get the project to score or after end? Uh mostly by tomorrow or day after tomorrow. Okay. So guys, any other questions? any reviews you might have about uh any feedbacks you might have have about us or the course in general. Well, we are at the very end of this term and uh it would be good to know about the feedback you guys might have about us. Yeah, I have feedback but it's an improvement which you can do in next terms. Oh, please share please share. Yeah, it will be",
  "Oh, please share please share. Yeah, it will be great actually for others also. So before coming to any session or something can we have some notes on like what are the agenda for this today's session what will be discussed like this uh has been a concern for all three of us me and uh we are trying our best to provide this this information to you in advance but uh the thing is that in previous we dealing with a lot of things other than just taking these decisions So that's why uh due to time",
  "these decisions So that's why uh due to time constraints we weren't able to do that and uh from the next term for sure that's the plan that we're going to go ahead with and uh uh what we're planning is that the agendas for each term for each live session would be uh mentioned will be published in the in that calendar window and over one week prior to the live session and then you can just have a look at it what they're going to discuss. Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling it's it can be given in that TDS",
  "I'm telling it's it can be given in that TDS portal itself with the URLs which we discussed like today we had some drive link shared right. So like that each and every session when we have we can have that drive link shared and we can discuss so that it be easy if someone want to see the recordings also they can have it out see the recording par they can work on the drives or other URLs which used in the recordings. So you are so you are suggesting that we should uh provide quotes have been",
  "that we should uh provide quotes have been what have been discussed in the live session in that uh TDS portal right? Yeah yeah yeah yeah because we we got like few transcript only right but we don't have any URLs right or something you are sharing so we are finding it difficult to get that URLs and understanding where it is there and how to well that's something that to we have to uh get into we have to work upon that and we actually discussed this with an uh he uh He suggested that we should",
  "this with an uh he uh He suggested that we should go ahead and develop this kind of tool and obviously we're going to automate it. Whenever the live session is you know recorded it should be automatically fetched the transcription and then those FAQ should be made those URL should be provided to you. Uh so all those uh we are going to come ahead with this is about live session other than that your management is great. Okay. As far as other processes are concerned, here we have a live session",
  "are concerned, here we have a live session deeply involving many people are talking on what are the topics and suggestions have been taken into consideration. So I feel it's good and GA part I feel we can have like solutions released after enter that would be great so that people can understand where they have one problem or something instead of release if you have difficulty yeah if you have difficulty in releasing like before end time it's fine but after end time it's fine right if you we can",
  "but after end time it's fine right if you we can have what are things we have gone wrong in GS and all we can understand Got it. Yeah, that can be done because some people might not have passed this course. So they would have to repeat the course anyway course is changing but still they can have an edge on it right rather than just having try. So it would be better as I I think many of us are facing this issue. They they are not able to crack the GS mode. So they are facing issue all that. Well",
  "GS mode. So they are facing issue all that. Well the thing is that if you just have a look at our previous live sessions at the very beginning of this term. So we were discussing each and every question in detail in those live sessions. So uh if someone wishes to have a look at the solution then I'll guess that they can have a look at the live sessions instead. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you discussing everything but they are unable to find out exact solution I guess because in even in project two when",
  "I guess because in even in project two when we had to collaborate most people told we don't have the solution itself we are planning to again write out everything so it's very difficult to do the project collaboration right so so that would be great if we had released some solution previously or something to have a reference just not the exact solution at least a reference of that because in versial or URL related questions we can have a deployment that's fine and we can check but other",
  "deployment that's fine and we can check but other questions even if you are given like chances to check the answers still if something has been gone wrong we are not able to find out what is the root why I told is that I had one question in like in week three where we have to get the number of tokens related to that. Yeah. At the during that initial phase of GS I used a trial and trial and error method and found out after doing during the project I found that we can get a request and get the",
  "I found that we can get a request and get the correctly. Okay. So that's some insight I got but some might not have figured out that itself. Mhm. Those are some things key things we have to learn about. Sure. Uh it was a great experience. Thank you. Thank you. Uh by the way, uh thanks for your uh feedback. Uh can you share your role number in the chat? Yeah, sure. Uh okay. Uh so any more feedbacks? I guess Rick, you open your mic. It's general it's it has been good like uh one one specific",
  "it's it has been good like uh one one specific observation is this that you guys are learning the material as we are learning it as well because it's so much new material uh it's probably better if you guys get access to the material a little earlier so that there's more more prep at least the TS right students do not know the specific topic earlier but for example next term something new is getting introduced and you should know that right now right during the break time so that you can not",
  "right during the break time so that you can not when the classes started and then you to know those things because that is required that is what I feel because sometimes we discussing your solution and we are brainstorming and it even though you had some more prep time you probably could have done it 15 So that is something which the post team should probably think that the TS should be given more resources. Otherwise, any other questions or reviews? Yeah. Yeah. [Music] See, overall overall the",
  "Yeah. Yeah. [Music] See, overall overall the course has been really good, right? uh notwithstanding good or bad academic performance but the but but but in terms of exposure in terms of the tools right and their practical application this is probably the best course uh till now which I've done in 19 right so in in terms of that there is no issue with it like the the only thing it it is very challenging and that challenging aspect has to be properly communicated and uh probably maybe we make a",
  "communicated and uh probably maybe we make a newer dashboard or something. Uh because people are just keep referring to that uh post by the seniors. If this this subject is good, this subject is not maybe a fresh survey or maybe we are students or maybe one house does it right and and and then we put into perspective that TTS is not that easy, right? So at least because when you put something label something as easy. Mhm. It is easy and if people do not become difficult exactly example you're",
  "do not become difficult exactly example you're saying ts exam is easy but I I think it is approachable right just do not put it is too easy just just if you if you prepare it may become easy but uh the whole thing is if you enter TDS with the mindset that it is going to be super easy super luddenly after week two or Week one or two are very easy but week three it picks up right. So uh if we have a proper mindset ts we'll probably have a uh non linear or maybe like an exponential learning curve.",
  "or maybe like an exponential learning curve. So then we know exactly what it will entail and we'll probably start watching the lectures before the course begins. Right? Otherwise what we doing we trying to just taking it easy because so that should probably not happen maybe it's credit should increase or something or or if if not increase sorry do not increase because it's a very difficult course exactly exactly bad bad bad thing I I taking Banglad's decision but but just to just prepare us",
  "decision but but just to just prepare us right Yeah. Moreover, uh what I have been so what we are trying to do is from the next term uh well I'm not sure about this. I have no certaintity of this but what I have heard is that from the next term uh we are going to change the prerequisite for TDS. It's going to be MLDD for TDS and uh I guess for TDS we don't have a prerequisite we have a core requisite if I'm not wrong. So for the next term, MLT is going to be MLT is going to be the prerequisite",
  "going to be MLT is going to be the prerequisite of TDS because the thing is that we require students to have that level of uh what should you say uh that level of uh familiarity that level of familiarity with uh the Pythonic code that we are writing in uh ML applications. So that's why we are planning that it should be considered as a prerequisite for TDS and if that goes well then it would be pretty good. I have shared the your number. Ah yeah yeah yeah. So that's good. Actually I only wanted",
  "yeah yeah. So that's good. Actually I only wanted to to check your score on my machine. That was the only reason I asked for that. Which one? Project two. Yeah project two. Okay guys, so if we don't have anything else to discuss, we can shed on this meeting. Okay, so it was nice uh interacting with you guys. Thank you for suggestions. Thank you for your feedbacks. And uh so this is the second last session of TDS and uh it was a really fun ride uh for this in this course. This was my first time",
  "for this in this course. This was my first time as a TA and uh being a TDSTA it was like to be honest it was kind of an honor to be a TDSTA and it was really fun. It was really it was something which I really learned from and uh yeah so thank you guys for attending this meeting. Thank you for participating in this course and staying active joining these live sessions and uh you know you guys join these live sessions interact with us and we feel like that our efforts are being paid off. So thank",
  "that our efforts are being paid off. So thank you for all that and uh I hope you have a blast in your enter. Okay. Bye sir. Yeah. Yeah. For project two I have few things that can cause issues for others also. I want to stand.",

  "Hey, Carter. Oh yeah. Hi, good evening. Sorry. Um, normally Prasana takes these sessions. So I was just informed that uh uh that the session is going on but uh he hasn't turned up yet for this session. So um yeah so mainly we'll just be taking some doubts uh and some clarifications for this session. Won't be any uh teaching uh events for this session. uh we will have one more session tomorrow and then that will be the one that uh will be the last session for this term and it'll cover uh the",
  "last session for this term and it'll cover uh the other aspects of uh the end term. Okay. And there will uh most likely we will have a mock available uh for it as well. Um so someone raised a question what is bonus? Okay. So the bonus marks uh uh is uh so the way it's structured it's for people that uh have already done G7. So if you have finished G7 and that means you have done uh the submissions you have completed the three peer reviews uh and so in that sense you have finished G7 uh which",
  "so in that sense you have finished G7 uh which the deadline for that uh finishing the peer reviews is tomorrow. uh then you have an opportunity uh so this is not for everyone this is only for people who actually uh did GA7 so uh if you have finished GA7 and you've done the three PA reviews then you get an opportunity to uh get five uh bonus marks that get added to your T- score and uh the way that works is you do five more reviews and for each review that you get uh then uh you'll still be",
  "review that you get uh then uh you'll still be evaluated based on the metrics of G7. Uh so the scoring metrics has been mentioned in the review form. So you'll have to follow that uh uh I won't explain that in detail here because I've done that in a session before. So it'll still follow the metrics uh for the three reviews, but that'll be scaled up to five extra reviews. And for each one of those you can get up to one mark for each one of those totaling up to five total bonus marks. So the idea",
  "up to five total bonus marks. So the idea behind it is um learning has to occur throughout uh TDS. I mean if we if the course was only four weeks uh then we would have no need for any extra modules or extra gas right. So uh the goal is uh uh to give students uh teaching for the all the seven modules and G7 is one of them and those that stuck it out and uh did G7 and there were I think there were about roughly 200 who did uh then they have the opportunity um to do u some extra activities because",
  "um to do u some extra activities because obviously they invested in the subject so they get the opportunity to do some extra activities. uh which not only helps them but it also helps us uh and uh our goal is always to uh increase collaboration uh get people to um review work and u this sort of interaction is very much valued in videos. So that's the idea behind uh giving those students an opportunity to get some extra uh bonus marks. Was that clear? I'm not really done review yet, but do we",
  "clear? I'm not really done review yet, but do we have some guidance on how to do it or I only did the G I attempted GS7, but I only did a few questions, so not all of them. Sorry that was not very clear. I think it maybe my internet or what? Okay. So, uh G7 is there some guidance in terms of how we are to grade them or you Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There is um there is a as soon as you go on the review form see the if you look at the review form if you did not sub if you did not do a single review you",
  "did not sub if you did not do a single review you will actually get zero in J7. you have to complete those uh reviews otherwise you will not get any marks. I I did not complete GA7 all questions. So I'm not sure how to judge other people, right? So is there some guidance on that or should we like complete the G7 once? I'm still not sure about your question like what exactly are you asking? Okay. Oh no. So uh uh Lakar uh so the questions in the form actually will help you to understand what has",
  "actually will help you to understand what has to be uh it is very clearly provided as to what is expected uh of the review. um even if let's say you haven't done uh any of the GS7 questions you can actually look at the submissions provided and appropriately provide your book I hope uh let's say I have answered your question uh it's not me it's sir uh who is it okay yeah yeah yeah Sorry, sorry, sorry. I mean I saw you're being unmuted first. Sorry, my bad. Yeah, Ken, the question was on uh what",
  "my bad. Yeah, Ken, the question was on uh what if this person has not completed the question, will they be able to review the question given the handicap that they have not uh completed that particular thing? I'm trying to think of a concrete example with G7. What specifically are they referring to? So let let's take this particular uh question. So let's let's assume that they have not done uh that spreadsheet question the very first spreadsheet question. Okay. Whatever be the reason the",
  "question. Okay. Whatever be the reason the student has not submitted his uh uh uh I mean the G7 uh it it is uh all the submissions except uh that spreadsheet question. Now given the hand that he has he has not looked into the spreadsheet questions will he be able to review another person who has done the spreadsheet questions? Yeah. So the uh review itself the process is uh they are able to um so for example when you're reviewing someone else uh they will have provided you for example the the",
  "they will have provided you for example the the graph and the the um uh what was it called the there will be some uh qualitative uh type information some quantitative information will be there. So for example there'll be a spreadsheet there'll be a graph and if the answer is easily obtainable from that then you can score them according but if you are not able to obtain the answer from them then you're evaluating them fairly anyway. So you're giving them a score whoever it is and if others agree",
  "them a score whoever it is and if others agree with your score so if there are other reviews because each one gets more than one review right. So uh if so if the aggregate of the other reviews come to the same conclusion then you have given a good review for for that person right because your reviews match what others have also seen in that I mean does that make it any clearer I Yes, it does. Yes, it does. Okay. Okay. So here is a uh here is a request to all those people who have at least done",
  "to all those people who have at least done a review uh and uh has seen uh has seen the entire set of GSL. There is a thread that is going on which is saying about the bonus mark. Uh so after you complete all the reviews uh if any of you could just put in your thoughts about GS7 and the bonus over there it would be really appreciate. Does that make sense? Uh yeah I mean you're talking about the thread where they talking about the bonus uh about Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. I mean it's good to get",
  "Exactly. Exactly. I mean it's good to get feedback because then we can uh see what things we can change or improve and know what uh the students thought about the GA itself whe they they uh gain something that is valuable to them or not. So that's always useful for us to what the gain for students from. Okay. Were there any other questions? Yes, carton. Uh, yes. Go ahead. Carton, uh, many students submit GS7 like who did not previously submitted G1 to GS6. So, they are trying to Okay. Okay.",
  "G1 to GS6. So, they are trying to Okay. Okay. Hang on. I've got to stop. I've I've got to stop you though. How did you know whether many students who are doing GS7 are the ones who didn't do GA1? What on what basis did you come to that conclusion? Uh I mean do you have data that on the basis of on the basis of threads like I also not did because I already did uh week one to six. Yeah. Number of that thread you can see. So that's my idea. I'm not sure. Okay. So here is a here is a comment to",
  "not sure. Okay. So here is a here is a comment to that. Okay. So all of you read newspapers. Yes sir. Yeah. So as per newspaper US is doing a massive uh tit fortat in terms of custom revenues, custom tariffs etc. Right. Yeah. So how much of that is true? What is happening to each I mean each country has a very different custom tariff right? much deeper. Mhm. So I mean before accusing or before even putting out any such things uh based on so do you believe newspapers that's my first question?",
  "you believe newspapers that's my first question? Yeah definitely not every newspaper but like I compare some newspaper then I believe on some newses mostly. Okay. Okay. Then let me let me ask a very direct question. Among the people who are posting in the thread that I haven't done uh GA I haven't done GA1 GA2. How many of those people do you believe? Actually I don't believe on anyone. I believe only on those person who DM me personally for like see how does it matter if somebody did some GS",
  "see how does it matter if somebody did some GS or not? It's their course right? is is their their score that is going to get affected. You have to see your own thing and how the calculation is setting up for you. Only the four G right are going to be counted in the final score. So probably they are deciding accordingly. Actually I'm not aware of bonus marks. So that's why I not did G7. Yeah, that issue. That could be an issue. But if it was mentioned somewhere then we cannot see. So uh ritik I",
  "somewhere then we cannot see. So uh ritik I mean it will not be an issue. Have you read what is the uh grading policy in the grading policy document? All I'm saying is if it's in the grading policy document then it it is not an issue. Huh? So uh have you I mean have has anyone of you read the grading policy document and looked at what how how do team awards bonus? Very simple question. [Music] uh according to them sir like they can assign some uh bonus activities from their end. So that's how",
  "uh bonus activities from their end. So that's how we get bonus marks. Three bonus marks. Okay. So which is correct which means you have read the green policy. Have you seen how bonus uh marks were provided in the previous uh versions of TDS? Uh in this time sir no no previous I'm not sure sir have you read the TDS uh uh the main web page have you gone through the main web page? No sir. Huh? Uh, no sir. In the Jan 2025 grading document, there is not much information but no no. So I mean in the",
  "not much information but no no. So I mean in the grading document it is mentioned how the bonus marks will be awarded for subjects. There is a a broad caveat. So what is bonus? What do you mean by bonus? Bonus is something that the course team provides for some additional activity. Okay, it is not related to graded assignments. Okay, graded assignments are one part. Graded assignments are only one part of it. Graded assignments, the graded assignments are evaluated separately. Exactly. So all",
  "are evaluated separately. Exactly. So all the people who are who are looking at the in the this TDS page it is written bonus activities may be posted on this course. Now that this specific condition actually puts the onus on our students to check actually this course if there are any bonus activities which are being announced. So yeah that is kind of covering this. Yeah. So basically I mean so maybe posted on discours is what we have said but essentially uh the long and short of it is bonus is",
  "uh the long and short of it is bonus is something that is at the discretion of the course team. It is the course team that decides what the bonus activity is. Okay. And um I mean very importantly if people have already attempted GS7 Ritwick I believe you have done G7 uh and since you haven't started you haven't started the peer review uh you wouldn't be able to look at it but uh please take a look at the email that has come to you regarding both if you have already done GST it means you would",
  "if you have already done GST it means you would have received an email regarding this bonus activity. Yes, I have the mail regarding bonus activities and also the five of the additional things which we have. Yeah. So, what I would just ask you is go through that mail and try doing at least one review. Okay. Try doing I I just I just saw I just saw so it's not very difficult to like I opened it up also just one tip if other people are reviewing use live server and you can then navigate but I'm",
  "use live server and you can then navigate but I'm not trying to do yeah so try doing one peer review and see the amount of effort that is needed for a okay so yeah then I believe I mean If anyone and it is fair I mean I'm not saying that this is the this is the best way of giving bonus this is the right way of giving bonus but after doing the reviews do a self-reflection is it does the uh five mark actually make sense is there effort involved does it I mean like what carton explained does it",
  "does it I mean like what carton explained does it improve the overall collaboration uh that is meant uh in the Right. Every action of the course team is primarily meant to improve the collaboration of learners as part of the course. If you look at ROE, if you look at projects, even if you look at GS right everywhere right from day one course team has been exhausting about the importance of collaboration. Now GS7 is a place where they have I mean it is the culmination of the entire thing right.",
  "it is the culmination of the entire thing right. So in that culmination they have made it interesting enough to in include collaboration as part of the entire assessment process. Right? So aren't they justified to provide additional incentive for people who have put in the effort to collaborate? I mean see I'm not saying what I'm saying is final or anything like that but do take a look at absolute facts before making your judgment. do not believe uh I mean so I mean this needs to be uh",
  "believe uh I mean so I mean this needs to be uh something that everyone needs to know I mean there is a lot of data there is a lot of uh uh what do you say emotional posts uh not just in discourse I'm talking in general uh if you look at social media everywhere it is the emotional angle that is where you can see a lot more of posts so each of these are data points if you look at uh uh the tools in data science talk about data right so now as a IIT Madras student especially a BS student what the",
  "Madras student especially a BS student what the course is teaching you is to use the data and make it make an informed decision about any aspect or narrate a story with data right I think that's what uh last week was about the data visualization and others what is the what is the data and what is the story uh part of Yeah. All I think the course team is asking is even before posting all these take a look at the data take a look at absolute facts and then you talk about what the issues and and",
  "and then you talk about what the issues and and if there's a merit in the issue definitely I think TDS team is the one who have been the most uh uh what do you say I mean most studentfriendly in the entire course. I have no doubt about uh that part of it. I mean in fact even they are still fighting. Yeah, in in fact uh they are still fighting with us for the P1 reevaluations regarding Docker 5 that is a completely different thread altogether. But I mean when a course team is trying to support",
  "I mean when a course team is trying to support and trying to get more students involved in a course I think the least that would be I mean at least as a acknowledgment of their effort the least that you could do is check the facts check the data before making any uh irrational judgment. Okay. So uh and this I I say this because going forward all I mean most of you would be doing great things in your life. Uh I'm pretty sure of that. Uh you should always remember this that uh never ever commit",
  "always remember this that uh never ever commit the folly of uh being led by emotional arguments. That's not good generally for one and generally not good for a democratic country. Okay. So, please keep this in mind. Yeah. Colton, uh, stage is all yours. Just wanted to say a few points before you would step out. Thanks, JK. I mean uh so I mean there's nothing significant I want to add to that except that uh uh yeah we um definitely always uh look out for the students interests and uh we have",
  "out for the students interests and uh we have made every effort uh to always advocate for for for you guys um whenever there's a a disagreement even among the in the course team uh we always um try to push the student advantage uh so that things are done pre in your way. So that's something we definitely do always. So uh I appreciate JK that you've uh joined this session today and helped clarify some of the uh the smoke and mist that is around the uh bonus market. So thanks for that. Uh one",
  "the uh bonus market. So thanks for that. Uh one more thing sir, how do we know about the like uh the efforts put in the GS7 uh the bonus activity part? Yeah, I mean uh this goes back to the the initial uh point I was trying to make which is um students that have taken the effort to go all the way to G7. Honestly, people just putting the effort to at least open the file, read the questions and giving some score whether I correct or not. Honestly, that that is effort enough. I've taken interviews",
  "that that is effort enough. I've taken interviews of people. Some people do not reply back to the interviewer even though we are close to selecting them that they're not getting selected. Yeah. So, that's uh that's a good point. And um with regards to uh G7 the other thing I was going to mention was there is a reason we have seen normally when you do peer reviews in other courses they anonymize it so you can't even know whose uh submission it is right but here we have actually given you the",
  "is right but here we have actually given you the email address of the people whose review you are whose submission you're idea behind that ish we don't want it to be anonymous we want you to engage with the other person if there is for example permissions that have not been given in previous so I remember when I when I have done stats myself right uh if the permission was not given we just put a zero that's it there is no no more discussion about it the person doesn't know that his submission",
  "it the person doesn't know that his submission is not being reviewed and you have no way of contacting that person that hey you know I want to actually look at your work maybe it's something really nice that I've not thought about but we want people here to engage with each other so when you look at the peer you can get in touch with them if you can't see their submission And then you can look at it. You can ask him questions about it. You know, why did they choose this visualization or why did",
  "why did they choose this visualization or why did they do it this way or how did they do it? And that engagement, that interaction that you have with that person then helps you also inform your reviewing, right? So you can actually do the review part after having engaged with the peer. So that's a very important question. Okay. Yeah. when we were doing this G7 right we were supposed to create the per give the permission view your access to everyone in I1 right yeah yeah now I have given that I",
  "in I1 right yeah yeah now I have given that I got request for somebody asking editor access you don't yeah don't yeah you don't need to give editor access you just need to give viewer access is sufficient because they can I remember that what I created I I give viewer access to everyone and I okay yeah Okay. So, okay. Viewer is sufficient. Okay. Okay. And and when we are requesting access, the default access is viewer only, right? As for it and um I'm not sure. I think um default might be",
  "and um I'm not sure. I think um default might be viewer, but uh I'm not sure. You'd have to check and see. Okay. Uh yeah. So JK made a good point which is you can also give them commentator access. So they can comment on things as well. So that's also safe because they cannot change anything but they can put comments uh in different places. So in case you all are not able to engage immediately because I just assume I just assume that because only one person is asking for editor access I then",
  "one person is asking for editor access I then then probably there's an issue because otherwise I would have gotten at least three requests right? Yeah. So yeah just um uh just uh you know don't worry about it. Hopefully the see many people do it at the last minute also right so deadline is tomorrow so that might be the reason why so far only one person has asked because only one person has probably bothered to see everyone has been given allocated at this stage everyone has been allocated who",
  "at this stage everyone has been allocated who has done G7 has been allocated totally eight people three for your actual G7 score and the five will be the extra for the bonuses so in total eight people hopefully will eventually look at uh but yeah the try to engage the people whom you have uh been allocated so that that way uh you know you are able to review it and they also get to take part in their own review. Honestly, honestly, honestly, I do not I I think if you've gotten most of most of",
  "do not I I think if you've gotten most of most of the people may have gotten good scores in first four, right? And they are going to be counted. The real score here is basically the bonus marks. Yes. Yeah. Because that is what matters. What you really get in the GA, it does not matter at all. Yeah. But again, the way to score in bonus also is going to have to be a bit tactical, right? In the sense that you can't just give anything, right? Because now you're going to be pulled in a review of",
  "now you're going to be pulled in a review of eight reviews. So your averages better be very close for you to actually get the bonus. How do you achieve this? You're going to have to achieve this by actually engaging with the people, right? Uh I have not given viewer access to a video. Yeah, I checked. I I gave that person uh viewer access already I think. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah. So, yeah. So, just um yeah, just uh just have fun with it and um you know uh try and uh gain what uh what we hope you",
  "know uh try and uh gain what uh what we hope you will gain from the interaction, the collaboration, viewing different people's work and things like that. Okay, I see there's a question in here somewhere. Okay, there's lots of things. [Music] Uh, we can do one thing that much going on. Reopen G7 for a day. Yeah, Vijit. Uh, unfortunately, deadlines are there for a reason. So, we can't u uh we can't do that. Unfortunately, we have pushed many deadlines for uh uh various situations that we had, but",
  "for uh uh various situations that we had, but they were never our intention. Our intention is usually to honor the deadline, but because of some unforeseen issues that we have faced, they end up sometimes getting moved. But in this particular case, it's uh we we will not be able to reopen JS that ship has already sailed mock. Yeah. So tomorrow we will try and get a mock for you. Uh irony is we we getting all these info after W7 deadline. Yeah. Yeah. I mean uh getting this after the W7 deadline.",
  "I mean uh getting this after the W7 deadline. That is true because this is only open for the people that actually did the W7, right? So that's why so it doesn't involve uh everyone but it involves the people who have taken the effort to do GA7. uh give me something. Do we have to peer review? Yeah. So if you don't do the peer review for J7, you're actually not going to get a score for G7. So the first three peer reviews which we sent a mail out, that is required for you to get a score in G7. If",
  "that is required for you to get a score in G7. If you don't do that, you will not get a score. That first three is important. The first three are not bonuses. That is actually to get your get your own G7 score. So just uh your own JS7 submission is insufficient. You need to do the peer reviews to actually get the score. uh like other courses can also okay uh P2 results okay so as right these bonus marks are really valuable yeah well I mean you know maybe there's a lesson in there right which is",
  "maybe there's a lesson in there right which is uh try and do everything I mean from my own personal viewpoint okay um even if I've got the best uh uh whatever it is 10 out of 11 uh 8 out of 6 I mean sorry six out of eight or whatever it is the course requires right and I've had these things right personally this is just my uh approach I still do and submit the 11th or the 12th week GS now maybe that's just me I don't know but I do them anyway because I actually enjoy the learning because I find",
  "I actually enjoy the learning because I find it valuable Sir. Yeah. So, this time I regret. Yeah. So, because I find it actually very valuable. I actually enjoy learning. So, um and that I think is true for at least some of the people that have done G7. I think they have uh found something of value in there. And so, they have done it and uh more more power to them, right? Because uh they they stuck it out. They stuck out the full uh seven modules. And um the other thing is we were very lenient",
  "And um the other thing is we were very lenient actually this term in past TDS terms uh because TDS was a bit easier than it is now. We actually used to have best six of seven in some in some terms. So in that case you would have been forced to most likely do all of right. So but this term was we understood it was tough for some students you know like week three week four projects were tough. So we deliberately uh reduced the threshold to four or seven but uh instead of um uh taking advantage of",
  "seven but uh instead of um uh taking advantage of uh the learning opportunity we have just used it as a grading opportunity right and not done more than what what you absolute minimum that was so I I mean we can flip that on its head and say okay you know right from next term you'll do best six or seven then you'll feel oh my goodness this is So unfair right now when we make it four or seven when we give bonus for week seven you're like oh my goodness it's and okay here's the other thing it's",
  "it's and okay here's the other thing it's not for week seven specifically it is if you have completed it all the and you have actually finished week seven only then you are eligible for attempting the course so it's not just for doing G7 you have to complete G7 and then you'll have the opportunity to score maximum of five it's not guaranteed you'll get five because it depends on how good your reviews are. If you actually read the review sheet and understand how it works, then you you'll see",
  "and understand how it works, then you you'll see that it's not a not a foregone conclusion. You give five reviews and you get five marks. It doesn't work like so. There is some effort involved. Okay. So that uh is about that P2 results. Okay. So yeah, so P2 results um we have had some uh unforeseen issues crop up. I can't I'm not at liberty to discuss them with you. Uh there are some serious issues that we are dealing with. Uh so there will be some delay. Uh one thing is for certain uh you will",
  "delay. Uh one thing is for certain uh you will um I I'm very reluctant to say at this stage but uh it will most likely occur on the Monday uh at the earliest Monday after your enter you'll get your uh uh P2 score that is the earliest okay uh operations has informed me also that uh they really really want it uh on that day Whether we can actually deliver it or not will depend on a lot of things that we are uh currently dealing with some internal matters. So I cannot um give you anything better",
  "matters. So I cannot um give you anything better than that at this stage. Okay? But here's the other thing as soon as u uh we are able to we will release it. Okay? That's always been our goal. We will still try. Okay. Uh I don't get any emails. don't get an email. I completed the form but I don't get an email. I didn't understand that. Vicki, can you explain that a bit? What do you mean by that? Vicki, are you one request? Uh yeah, Vicki is not in the session. Yeah, go ahead. Yes. Is it Lakshi?",
  "the session. Yeah, go ahead. Yes. Is it Lakshi? Is it? Yes. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Uh sir uh among the student who submitted week seven like can you publish a data uh from those uh students how many of them completed rest six assignments like for like curioity uh like you want you want the data data output for that. Yeah that's something we can we can arrange that's something we can arrange. I think JK in fact wanted that information as well. So he has access to that information and uh I think he",
  "has access to that information and uh I think he will put out a post uh later today on that same thread where everyone's posting and uh you'll have access to some of that information. Okay. Like from this we like now how many student are did week seven for learning or only for the marks? Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I think yeah it's interesting. I mean it's something we would like to know. So uh one thing I know is um Totally active students in TDS is roughly about 700 students totally active and",
  "is roughly about 700 students totally active and of that around 200 have done GS7. Yeah. Yeah. So Lakshai I I don't think anyone who had submitted GS7 would have imagined that they would get a bonus additional after this. I don't think anyone was even privy to that. Even the coasting was not aware of that. I'm pretty sure of uh that part. Okay. So, nobody would have done it for the goods. Not for I like want to know like how many of them actually interested in week seven or like four out",
  "interested in week seven or like four out completed previous assignments. So, that's the reason. Sure. Sure. Sure. No, no, that is another thing that even I wanted to know because uh I mean something that uh yeah I mean they have attempted because they haven't done the four out of six right or they have very poor performance in the earlier four and they want to better one of the low scoring uh thing uh yeah that's that's definitely something that I want in fact I want to take a look at what has",
  "I want in fact I want to take a look at what has happened to all these people uh in general uh in P1, P2, ROE, everything needs to be checked, right? Yes sir, definitely. Yeah. And it's something even the TDS team, we are always interested in data. I mean the the name the the name is in the course, right? So we are also interested in all these interesting metrics because it helps inform us in course design and things. So it's something we also are interested like other way around it is always",
  "are interested like other way around it is always true like who have not attempted week seven like most probably they have got four best 400 okay so uh I've gone through all the questions here uh anything else People have a question about any clarifications they want something but probably ask it after the recording. Um okay. So you you're going to ask it after the recording stops. Is it off the record? Yes. It's basically not related to huh not related to sorry not related to the interm or",
  "not related to sorry not related to the interm or mix. Oh okay. Okay. Yeah, that's that's okay. Yeah. Okay. But just just because you're asking um in term basically the revision is basically we should focus on the mock which is coming up and then just review the course content. Right. Yeah. So there are some so I had given some uh broad uh instructions to the TA TAs about um what areas are worth focusing on and uh it's not surprising that those are the same areas that get focused on almost term",
  "the same areas that get focused on almost term after term. uh so that's why it's worth looking at uh maybe last term's GA and maybe one more GA before that but particularly last terms uh end term sorry not GA I meant N term if you look at last terms end term it will very closely mimic that sort of format you'll have uh some normal MCQ type questions in the first part first segment and then you will have uh some scenario- based questions that will deal with a topic a little more thoroughly and",
  "deal with a topic a little more thoroughly and um it will cover all seven weeks. Uh and of course not everything in all seven weeks will be will be important but those things will be highlighted in the in the sessions. So I think Jiraj although I was not there for the entire session yesterday um he I think would have gone through at least some of the he would have focused on what some of the important topics are. The mock itself will also help you because it will be uh generally around the",
  "you because it will be uh generally around the themes of things that will be asked in [Music] he did discuss it's like stuff like fast API request module uh questions about what a tool is not necessarily more stuff about the tool but if for example you should know what open define is used for and then uh geo by uh just getting locations and have a same Since may question may or may not come because there was some issue with it last time. Yeah. But if it comes you probably give us more data on",
  "But if it comes you probably give us more data on how to or on on how that arc sign is basically sign inverse maybe. So this is the kind of stuff. Yeah. So this is yeah this is kind of the usual fair of TDS and uh one thing I want to reassure you TDS end term is always very easy even if you don't study right um realistically I can say someone can score probably at least 80% without study so the remaining 20% uh is based on you just being very focused on the what things we say are important if",
  "on the what things we say are important if you if you are thorough with the things we say are important to focus on that will be the remainder 20 where you get the differential that says okay I've really aced this exam because I attended those last two sessions and I looked at the mock and uh that uh we typically find students every term when they get past the endm they'll say oh that really helped me so they say thanks for that and it's not going to be any different this term we'll uh get you",
  "to be any different this term we'll uh get you up to speed on what will what is the good areas for when will the mock be used uh there I can't give a definite uh time frame but sometime tomorrow before 13 yeah before 13 sometime tomorrow before uh definitely before the session starts anyway okay thank you uh have you tried chicken oh that's okay that's one thing I wanted to mention by the way uh some of you if you get an email from SC20002 that is the official uh TDS email announcement mailbox",
  "is the official uh TDS email announcement mailbox box. Uh if you by any chance send mail to it, okay, uh that mail is not going to be read, okay? No one checks those that mailbox because it's an announcement mailbox. So don't reply to that mailbox. If you have an issue and you have a query first best place discourse why because discourse uh there will be possibly four sets of eyes looking at it, right? uh and so there's a very high chance when I say four sets I mean from the team side okay plus",
  "say four sets I mean from the team side okay plus there will be a super high chance that students also are looking at it so there is a very high chance you'll actually get a response um whereas uh if you still feel that you want to send the mail send it to either Jira or myself uh you know typically uh if you send it to the TAS and myself then uh it's possible to you know get a response from as well. Uh so that's the way to go about. But if you send it to SC20002, that's almost guaranteed to",
  "send it to SC20002, that's almost guaranteed to not get a response because no one looks at that mailbox. It's an announcement mailbox. So don't reply and send messages to SC20002. Okay. Uh sorry for the incons. I did not any email for that email. One guy shared to check. Soon what Vicki is saying is he has submitted the GS7. However, he has not received either a review form nor the email regarding the bonus if I understand. Okay, I can check straight away. Vicki, can you um give me your um give",
  "away. Vicki, can you um give me your um give me your email address in the G G the G chat here, please? I can check that's okay. Uh let me see. Uh just give me one minute. Okay. [Music] and request six [Music] submissions. So, I've got the submissions sheet here. [Music] Okay. So, one of the submissions are past the deadline. Okay. So, both your submissions are actually past the deadline. That's probably why you did not get a form to fill out. I mean, the deadline was 26th um well, 27th midnight",
  "the deadline was 26th um well, 27th midnight to be precise, but 1 second before that was the deadline. So yours both of your submissions were well past that deadline. That's why you did not get a form. I mean do you live in India? Hello Vicki. when he's he or she still has uh oh no they're on in the session submitting time before five minutes of the deadline uh not according to the G sheet we have the G sheet says you submitted on 27th one is at uh 3 in the morning and then the other one is at",
  "uh 3 in the morning and then the other one is at uh five or 6 minutes before 3 in the morning as well so it's all both of them were close to 3:00 in the morning that's what The G sheet says, did you uh by any chance edit the form after you submitted it later? Because if you did an edit on the form, then it will uh update the time to the edit time. So then we will have no way of knowing you actually submitted it before. But that is if you edited an already existing form. Yes, but in time. So you",
  "already existing form. Yes, but in time. So you made an edit within the time not according to the G sheet. JK, you have any thoughts on this? Yeah, what you said is right. I mean uh but even even if they edit the form, it will come as a duplicate entry with a new time. So whatever they have submitted it will be I mean to my understanding even for edits it is it is going to go in as a new new uh new entry on the G. Yeah. Not sure what that is. Okay. I'll have to I'll have to test that out if",
  "Okay. I'll have to I'll have to test that out if that's really true. But um there are I have only two two entries for Vicki and both those entries are on the 27th and both are sort of within 6 minutes of each other near 3:00 in the morning. So uh can you do a double check? I mean um carton did we uh uh did we uh allow automatic response uh to the form? Uh, no. Students had to actually submit. It's a G form. So, they had to actually hit the submit button. No, no, no, no, no. So, what I meant is",
  "button. No, no, no, no, no. So, what I meant is the moment they submit, will they get an acknowledgement of the submission? Uh, I can check. Yeah, I think he has g so he can put it on his course. So, it says uh send. Yeah, it send responders a copy of their response. So it's been set to always. So yeah, they would have received uh an immediately an email that confirms that they send. So if their email uh is a proof, if they can send us if Vicki can send us a proof, then I'm happy to send him a",
  "can send us a proof, then I'm happy to send him a form. Yeah, he is telling that he that is on 26th March 11:52 p.m. No, no. Yeah, but if you see he would have got an email, right? He just needs to send us that uh forward us that email that he got. That is confirmation of when he received it. Did you understand Vicki? Just send us forward us that email which is the confirmation of your post. So post J there's a lot of noise from your side. Can you just mute for a second? So what I was saying",
  "you just mute for a second? So what I was saying Vicki is uh when you submitted the form uh there would have been a confirmation email that is sent to you. Okay. So what you do is send that email forward that email to us because then we can see the the time stamp on that email. So if the time stamp on that email shows it is before midnight on 26 then that's sufficient proof for us. We will send you out immediately uh a review form for so that you can fill it up. Okay. Bey can screen share and",
  "can fill it up. Okay. Bey can screen share and so it right now also if you Yeah. You got three or Yeah. So three or four. Just send us the first one. Whatever was the earliest one that you got response sheet, just send it to send send it to my email. Okay, it's I'll put my email in the chat box. If you send it there, then that's uh okay. Yes, tell me. What happened in today's callation or some other discussion? Sorry, in today's call. Oh, today's call uh just we yeah today we just clarifying uh",
  "call uh just we yeah today we just clarifying uh some questions regarding bonuses for uh people who have completed G7. And uh the other thing that we talked about was um uh when scores are likely to come out for P2 for example and P1 and things of that sort. So uh basically those were the main things that we were discussing and uh how reviews around G7 are designed. So how you can collaborate with people uh in order to get a good score in G7. So coordinate with each other um get in touch with",
  "coordinate with each other um get in touch with the people that you're reviewing that sort of thing. Okay. and bonuses separately only for applicable for G7 right it's not overall bonus right it's not for G7 that's a misunderstanding so G7 only if you have completed G7 as additional uh opportunity for those who completed it they only they will be eligible to uh um attempt uh possibly getting bonus and again the bonus marks itself will be done on the same basis as uh the G7 scores. So how you",
  "on the same basis as uh the G7 scores. So how you score in G7 is uh will be scaled in the same way for the bonuses. So if I did not submit GS7 then I will not get bonus for TDS. No, if you do not submit GS7, you will not even be eligible to attempt the attempt doing the bonuses. But for the course itself, sorry, no. Is this bonus just additional to the 100 marks of the total course or is just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is addition. Yeah. No, it is not for GS. It is a it's a course bonus. So if",
  "is not for GS. It is a it's a course bonus. So if you say for example you get 75 marks in PDS overall after everything is calculated your total T score then if you have done the bonus questions you have the possibility of getting up to five marks. It's not guaranteed five marks because it depends on uh how the reviews go. The reviews have to be good reviews. There are a lot of criteria that are there. G7 they they form they follow the same pattern of grading as G7. So you have up to you can get",
  "of grading as G7. So you have up to you can get possibly up to five marks but it's no by no means it is not guaranteed. Okay. But in during like uh one discussion we discussed about this one and you clarified it's just applicable for GS7 alone. So yeah so it's applicable. So it is applicable to people who completed JSON. So not just people who attempted. Yeah but I think you have told it as only applicable for GS7 because we had that recording. I only asked the question so that everybody can",
  "I only asked the question so that everybody can understand and you told it's not necessary to attend GS7 because you it's just applicable for the GS7 alone bonus and I did not attempt it. Bonus is only announced today. So when this come Yeah, it was mentioned earlier. It was mentioned like two weeks ago. There was no bonus to GS7 or there was no talk of a bonus two weeks ago if I'm not. Yeah, there are no that's what I'm thinking. There is there is no bonus for J7 specifically. So I'm not sure",
  "is no bonus for J7 specifically. So I'm not sure you I I I I attended that call. I still remember that you were explaining the peer reviews and I had asked this question. Oh I understood what ah I understood what you talking about. Okay. Okay. So see there are two parts. Okay, I also got it. Yeah, that you may clarify. Yeah. So, okay. So, in J7, right, there are these um okay, for lack of a better word, they we have called them bonus. But effectively, what it means is when you when you complete",
  "what it means is when you when you complete a certain question, there are these bonus u uh how do you say some uh extra marks you get for having done three in a row or something like that, right? That's that's what I was talking about back then. Those things are specific. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Those are specifically for JS. Yeah. Because again also Yeah. It's necessary to submit JS7. You only told it's not necessary if you submitted rest of the assignments. Yeah. Yeah. It is that's true, right?",
  "Yeah. Yeah. It is that's true, right? It's not necessary to complete J7 back then. Yeah. So, so bonus is not coming for me, right? because of confirmation. Yeah, but here is but here is the point right this is the point that we talked about earlier in this session. The point in the earlier part of the session is nobody knew that G7 is going to uh rather than G7 no one knew that bonus is going to be something available to people who did G7 but some people did it anyway right? Yeah, correct.",
  "some people did it anyway right? Yeah, correct. Yeah, correct. Yeah. So, it is an incentive to them because they have taken the efforts to do it even though that it was not necessary. Yeah. But I could have done it but because you should have done it, right? But you confirmed it. It's not necessary. Yeah. But that is true. It wasn't necessary. It is It is totally up to the students. I need to get right. Yeah. So, I agree. Yeah. I don't disagree. you confirm but that bonus that you were talking",
  "you confirm but that bonus that you were talking about that's a different bonus because that actually adds up to the GA score itself that is like a but as you're doing the GA it's fine it's fine yeah it's fine but still I missed out the opposity just because you confirmed it's not been affecting any of the grades so that's why I just wanted it is not affecting any of the grades yeah he told yeah yeah it is not I mean it is still not affecting in your foot because no bonus can affect right if we",
  "your foot because no bonus can affect right if we are in an educ it can be making it 81 right no so see what he meant at that point is it is not going to the bonus is not going to affect your current whatever is your score it is not going to affect you not doing so I I believe the clarification is you not doing GSM is not going to impact your uh current score I mean because you didn't do see it is always best four out of seven so the interpretation I would be yeah so let's assume that you have",
  "I would be yeah so let's assume that you have done only three out of six and you really had I did I I did six out of seven six out of six I got 600 marks seven I did not do because we confirmed it it's not necessary to do itself and it will not add any value to the course grade so I did not do it that's what thing was it is not going to uh add value to the GAA score. Uh if uh if you have already scored 600, there is no value that is going to come to the G uh GA score just because you did uh",
  "come to the G uh GA score just because you did uh GS7. However, it is a choice given to you whether you want to do GS7 or not is a choice given to you. Yes, correct. It's fine. Okay. So, I would not be eligible for bonus itself. That's what the no conclusion is that course bonus. Yeah. Yeah. You will not be eligible for the course bonus which is correct. Which is correct. Yeah. Correct. Right. So, I missed out the opportunity because of the misunderstanding. Right. Yeah. But uh that's not the",
  "Right. Yeah. But uh that's not the other thing only thing. At that point, we weren't even planning on giving bonuses extra for the course. We didn't even know that there was going to be okay fine that's fine but yeah but still you have to consider like this is fine so it's we have to consider see then in that case we have to consider a lot of other thing right a lot of people didn't score uh well for P1 the course team did that additional thing of building docker images they are still fighting",
  "of building docker images they are still fighting for uh giving marks for people who put the docker file in a different There are a lot of things that we have to consider, right? I mean your point is taken. Your point is see your point your feedback is taken. I mean had there been some announcement regarding that this activity may lead to a bonus. If that had been announced it would I mean you might have actually tried your luck with uh GSL, right? Correct. Yeah. that point is well well and",
  "right? Correct. Yeah. that point is well well and truly taken. Yeah. Okay. And and there is no action going to on that because it is the course decision. Okay. So I know but so those who did not earn the GS7 will not be getting any bonus. Yes. The final call. Yes. It is but also but but also those who took J7 have no guarantee of getting it either. That's also the other thing. Why is the top? So yeah, see you you you really have to take a look at the activity to understand how the G7 scores are",
  "the activity to understand how the G7 scores are going to come. So Telvin, I I know you have been a very active student. Take a look at the activity. Take I mean you have a lot of friends who might have received that email for Burj, right? Take a look at one of those reviews. try putting in some effort to do the review and see why they are getting that much. Okay. Yeah. I I was there in the PR discussion session. I know what are the criteria and they were telling that. So that's fine for me.",
  "they were telling that. So that's fine for me. That's fine. But still I missed out many chances like was unlucky when I fighted with he also knows that I don't want no so tell you you it was not a fight right it was we eventually you got what you uh deserved right the you got the right marks and everything so it wasn't a No, not actually. But because of that, several people got good grades, right? Apart from me. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and also similar case. Yeah. Similar case we had with another",
  "case. Yeah. Similar case we had with another student. he uh wanted you know he was u raised the issue of the docker file and um I was always uh not happy with uh the whole aspect of uh docker file was not mentioned that it should be at the b at the base of the root directly okay it wasn't mentioned explicitly so that is something I was never happy with anyway because I feel that students uh should have been informed of that so eventually what happened is We managed to convince the course team I",
  "is We managed to convince the course team I mean the the people who run the the program that see this is something that we really should address. So we walked through the whole uh process uh we verified many processes that went through as far as project one was concerned and I pointed out at this stage this didn't happen at this stage this didn't happen where at this stage where something could have been done it wasn't done properly. So I explained all these things in the defense of students",
  "all these things in the defense of students who wanted to get Docker file evaluated because I also believe it was not fair actually. So but eventually the they you know that they have now decided that okay we will we will have a look at this uh issue and so that student who took it all the way to the top I'm not saying that's the approach you should take because we are always fighting for you anyway but you don't see that okay we don't display that openly in public all the time uh but we",
  "that openly in public all the time uh but we whether you send an email to the top or not or what we are always uh doing our best to get you the best outcome and Um what eventually happened is we managed to come to an agreement where they will evaluate these specific submission separately from the rest of the students and we did a trial check on this guy who had raised it all the way to the top and we found that okay we uh did it according to his wish. We searched uh the where the docker file",
  "wish. We searched uh the where the docker file was and we tried to build his submission and guess what it ended up he still got zero anyway because he had overestimated the quality of his entire submission. So uh but because of uh people who took the effort to you know raise the issue and things of that sort we were always listening and so now because of him although he got zero others have benefited right so that's a good thing only that's a good outcome I think that's a good outcome that",
  "a good outcome I think that's a good outcome that others have benefited even though he he did not benefit directly but there is also an intangible he benefited from the learning so that was helpful So that is always something more valuable than the marks. I mean I keep saying this and people don't believe me right but uh when you graduate from this program you even two years from now you will laugh at yourself for bothering so much about marks. It will become literally uh trivial that trivial.",
  "It will become literally uh trivial that trivial. Ask any graduate I challenge you to ask any graduate from any program right this question. Did the marks matter? Uh you know ask them after a couple of years and they will say yeah it didn't matter in the end but what mattered is what they learned. Sorry I do not remember my NBA marks like I know that I was a good student but I do not remember the exact marks. Yeah. So that's it. The marks are even if it is low or high whatever what matters the",
  "if it is low or high whatever what matters the most right in your life is what you do going forward that is what you are defined by you're not defined by the things you have done in the past what you are doing right now what you're going to do tomorrow that is what will define you okay so that is something you should remember always uh and uh so don't worry so much about one mark here one mark there you're you're unnecessarily stressing yourself over these things. uh try to enjoy the learning",
  "over these things. uh try to enjoy the learning and uh enjoy the journey and uh then do something great you know uh that is what I my advice to you I mean there's the world is full of fantastic examples of that so for example how many of you know this guy Baron he designed this game called star value have you heard of him has anyone heard of him okay I don't I Yeah. So even if you don't play games, I'll just tell you what his story is. Okay. He graduated out of university and u he started doing",
  "out of university and u he started doing a a job and he absolutely hated the job. So he quit his job. Okay. And he had some little bit of basic some programming knowledge. He decided okay I want to learn by myself a little bit of uh game logic. Uh then he's decided okay I want to learn a little bit of uh how to do p how to do graphic art art I then he decided uh he wanted to know how to do music and then slowly bit by bit he put all these pieces together and it took him four years right four",
  "together and it took him four years right four years and uh then he created a game okay now this game if you look at it you'll think this is looks like a game that came out of the 1990s okay and this is something that was created only like maybe five or six years ago, something like that. Okay. And uh it looks like a game that came out in the 1990s. But his game design and everything, his sound design, all the things that he put together, all the elements that he put together, they're so well",
  "elements that he put together, they're so well made that he sold, so each copy of this game cost 2,000. Okay. He sold 20 million copies of this game, right? Basically, a guy who uh So, what is the name of the game? It's called Stardew Valley. The game itself is not remarkable, but the story is remarkable, right? It is not what he uh you know he he like most of us would have gone to a job and got frustrated and everything but you know he decided that that's not going to define who he is. He did",
  "that that's not going to define who he is. He did something with uh the things he learned and he achieved something far greater than almost any 99% of the people who was doing post right and he was just an ordinary guy nothing special about him so did the marks matter to him no what mattered is what he did right so that is why I keep saying to you don't don't fret about these one or two marks here and there right life is much bigger than that instead enjoy the learning and what you learn right",
  "enjoy the learning and what you learn right think how you can use it and how you can uh achieve great things with it you know solve someone's problem or fix something that needs fixing you know see what you have learned and how you can apply it to something that matters you know and it can be something trivial it can be something that looks like a very old 1990s game but you know what you can achieve success even with that so what you do matters it is not this trivial one mark year that you two",
  "it is not this trivial one mark year that you two marks here that you're fighting over and dying over and getting frustrated over and uh you know giving you blood pressure and all these things right it doesn't matter certainly you're true only but I want to say an story which is my real story so in my B degree I lost my rank okay university rank just because I did not put for reevaluation if I had fighted for that I have got university rank So marks do matter at times. So some people feel it's",
  "do matter at times. So some people feel it's a failure. Okay. So there are two you're making an assumption. You're making a very big assumption there that had you got the marks your trajectory of life might been different more successful etc. I'll tell you one thing not a single person on this earth can guarantee you what tomorrow is. Tomorrow you cannot guarantee you will even get up from the bed. Right? So be very careful when you make that assumption right that if you had succeeded you would",
  "right that if you had succeeded you would have been in a different place no one can predict that not a single person today I am successful but I am telling if I had fighted for that mark I would have gotten university rank and that would have been in my sh as in proof or great achievement. So I tell m mark max marks to better but how do you live or how do you be successful it is the different ways. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to tell you everyone that if people are thinking marks don't matter",
  "that if people are thinking marks don't matter then take my story. It it does matter especially when scholarships are attached to them. Uh just just one thing maybe in future TDS courses announced that any one of the GS would be having bonus marks randomly. So at least people know that there is a bonus associated. Yeah. Yeah. I mean a point noted I mean Telvin see that's what something that I have said the point is duly noted even even in the current TDS course we we said that it may come in",
  "current TDS course we we said that it may come in discourse right I mean if you look at the wording yeah because we ourselves are wording is legally correct legally I can see it is correct so there is no poking the whole thing but if it is more clearer it will help students definitely agreed agreed yeah yeah yeah see even force team didn't know what to do and in fact it was the brainstorming over a week that finally resulted in this I mean this thing that okay let's give more uh time for",
  "this thing that okay let's give more uh time for collaboration and let's value the collaboration so that's that's the larger decision behind uh the bonus okay but I I do agree I mean I do understand what you guys are seeing and yeah it makes a lot of sense I mean so I mean having a slightly larger wording Again the purpose of bonus uh is is very clear uh for the course key. It should uh improve the learning. It should improve the understanding and it should lead to collaboration. These three",
  "and it should lead to collaboration. These three are the three pivots of uh uh the three what do you say pillars of uh tools in data science. You should always learn. You should always help others learn and definitely uh the other part of it is always have a more supportive uh e uh ecosystem for your uh peers to try uh which makes the course much better actually many new things happening this term so that's why we really feel like uh why these bonus given to yeah yeah I mean see life is like We",
  "given to yeah yeah I mean see life is like We take all those we take all you can't see the that's the beauty of this course right I mean you compare this course with any of the I mean I'm I'm I'm even happy to say you compare it with even an MIT open courseware uh uh course take Gilbert Strand for example I mean use there I mean compare this with even good standard courses and try to measure the learning coming out of those I know it's it's Not an exactly an apple appleto apple comparison but I",
  "exactly an apple appleto apple comparison but I think this is one of the truly world-class course that you will see in the entire program. Yes sir I am agree with you sir like uh till now uh in this course only like I learn uh a lot of things like I don't know coding at all but uh using chat GPT I start to learn uh coding and all that stuffs. So that's this course is amazing sir really amazing from learning point of view I say like uh I learn a lot of things our GitHub contribution crafts are",
  "lot of things our GitHub contribution crafts are proof of the learning we have had in the course yes definitely yeah so something that you should also go and read is uh Anand has a post on learning versus scoring marks I mean just go and read that post for yeah post for everyone I think it is a true reflection of what learning means right and to Telvin uh I know university marks so uh let me tell you my story to you Telvin uh I'm I'm I had the unique distinction of uh receiving uh my graduation",
  "distinction of uh receiving uh my graduation degree from two different prime ministers okay two different prime ministers I chose to skip it so the point is whether marks or other things are important or uh this thing it's a personal question okay it's a personal value value question I mean I do not disagree with anyone who is saying that mark is important for them I do not disagree with them but however in the long arc of life these things will not have that much of value because uh at a",
  "will not have that much of value because uh at a certain point of time the certificate in the shelf and other aspects do not actually help you to cut through the difficulties of life. Uh I mean I don't have that much of experience but I mean whatever limited life I have lived saying is true only I did my degree in mechanical engineering but I am working in IT that's the proof. Yeah. So, so the point is it's it's it's it's not about having that I mean yes marks do matter mark I mean certain",
  "I mean yes marks do matter mark I mean certain cases entry the thing everything matters but once you are inside ITM and you are an IITM student you should understand what that value I mean there is a value to that right there are much more important valuable points uh associated with it and you're not defined by your mark Telvin or anyone for that matter I mean your CGPA don't define you your CGPA actually determine a lot of different I mean whether you uh get to take part in M's courses uh",
  "whether you uh get to take part in M's courses uh inside IITM all those matters but it does not actually matter when it comes to success in life okay in the long arc of life success and other metrics marks I don't see the value uh yeah it's a personal opinion I will not disagree with anyone who says marks are important but this is again my personal opinion that marks I mean though it may look important it does not define who you are. Okay. So all those people who are having uh who think that a",
  "those people who are having uh who think that a mark is going to make changes uh yeah look back at this moment 3 years from now I think the yeah the session is recorded and streamed uh this YouTube hopefully YouTube won't delete this uh this particular thing is there even for now I think uh uh at least for five 10 years this recording will still be there so you can come back 5 years or 10 years later and take a look at this time stamp and uh yeah I mean then evaluate whether marks did actually",
  "I mean then evaluate whether marks did actually make a difference. Yeah. Yeah. J last thing I want to ask. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See it has been added. Only thing is it has to be pushed along with the GA. Yeah, that no yeah it will be pushed along with the NM or like along with before endm before enterm uh see the problem is uh the score push is an actual process. So unless and until we have because uh there are multiple uh GA marks that are pending from TDS. So something that",
  "that are pending from TDS. So something that I've told Carlton is uh the amount of effort for pushing a single mark and the amount of effort for pushing everyone's mark is the same for us. So I've told Carlton that we will add it uh but definitely we will add it. Tell your name is uh definitely there in the correction. Okay. Okay. No no I just want to know when it will be reflecting that's why I just want to ask. Yeah. Most probably it will reflect only on 14th Kelvin. It may not reflect at the",
  "only on 14th Kelvin. It may not reflect at the moment. But I assure you that your correction is uh there in place. Yeah. Yeah. It's fine, fine, fine. I just want to know because it's hardly two three days left, right? That I I want to clarify when it would be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. And clar also. Sorry, what was the question? Uh sir I want to ask like uh will there be any session for project one solution like afterm or we have produced we have given the solution",
  "or we have produced we have given the solution it's on the discourse post okay so that's the solution I actually tried that solution but uh it's not running on local machine so I have to create a docker image etc and all yeah yeah yeah the solution is designed to be docker so that solution will uh I mean you can still tweak it to make it work on your local machine but it is designed to dockerize and uh you'll have to put it in the test environment that we test everything. So even Anan's",
  "that we test everything. So even Anan's solution script which he wrote I think back on 27th Jan if I'm not mistaken he wrote that solution 27th Jan and it wasn't even a very in his words it wasn't even a wellthoughtout solution so um but still it ended up scoring the highest uh marks in the evaluation so we did it exactly the same as everybody else we dockerized it and ran the same test suite that we do and his came out on top so All right sir. Thank you. Okay. I think uh that's it for this",
  "Thank you. Okay. I think uh that's it for this session. Um thanks everyone for uh joining and uh thanks tomorrow session at what time? Uh 8 to 10. Same same time 8 to 10. Yeah that will be a final session right for TDS. Yes it'll be a final session. Yeah. And uh definitely I will jump. Okay great. Uh so I'll stop the recording now because I think uh the quick wanted to ask some off the record questions. So all right man recording stop recording.",

Explore:\n* Anthropic Prompt Optimizer",
  "* Anthropic Prompt Optimizer\n* OpenAI Prompt Generation\n* Google AI-powered prompt writing tools\nBe clear, direct, and detailed\nBe explicit and thorough.

  "* GOOD: Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it's observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)",
  "When you ask a question, don't be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. The clearer you are, the better the answer you'll get. For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it's observed and its significance in astronomy.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nGive examples",
  "Anthropic | OpenAI | Google\nGive examples\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n* BAD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n* GOOD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:\n1. To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight...\n2. To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through...",
  "Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\nGive examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don't just say 'build something.' Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nThink step by step\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.",
  "* BAD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n* GOOD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)",
  "Ask the model to think step by step. Don't ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves - like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.",
  "Anthropic | OpenAI | Google\nAssign a role\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n* BAD: Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n* GOOD: You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)",
  "Tell the model who they are. Maybe they're a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.

Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it's coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nUse XML to structure your prompt",
  "Use XML to structure your prompt\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n* BAD: Here's what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n* GOOD:\n* <instructions>\n*   Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n* </instructions>\n* <example>\n*   Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).",

It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):",
  "Here's how it works:\n* It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n* ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4)\n* There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs\n* Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\nimport base64",
  "# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==",
  "# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()",
  "# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n<img",
  "<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nBase64 is used in many places:\n* JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n* Email: MIME attachments encoding\n* Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n* JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication",

Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n1. Search. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. Classification. Classify text into categories.",

It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.",
